	abstract = {Live attenuated vaccines could have beneficial, non-specific effects of protecting against vaccine-unrelated infections, such as BCG protecting against respiratory infection. During the COVID-19 pandemic, testing of these effects against COVID-19 was of interest to the pandemic control programme. Non-specific effects occur due to the broad effects of specific live attenuated vaccines on the host immune system, relying on heterologous lymphocyte responses and induction of trained immunity. Knowledge of non-specific effects has been developed in randomised controlled trials and observational studies with children, but examining of whether the same principles apply to adults and older adults was of interest to researchers during the pandemic. In this Personal View, we aim to define a framework for the analysis of non-specific effects of live attenuated vaccines against vaccine-unrelated infections with pandemic potential using several important concepts. First, study endpoints should prioritise severity of infection and overall patient health rather than incidence of infection only (eg, although several trials found no protection of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 infection, it is associated with lower overall mortality than placebo). Second, revaccination of an individual with the same live attenuated vaccine could be the most effective strategy against vaccine-unrelated infections. Third, coadministration of several live attenuated vaccines might enhance beneficial non-specific effects. Fourth, the sequence of vaccine administration matters; the live attenuated vaccine should be the last vaccine administered before exposure to the pandemic infection and non-live vaccines should not be administered afterwards. Fifth, live attenuated vaccines could modify the immune response to specific COVID-19 vaccines. Finally, non-specific effects of live attenuated vaccines should always be analysed with subgroup analysis by sex of individuals receiving the vaccines.},

	abstract = {Background: Vaccines induce antigen-specific immunity, which provides long-lived protection from the target pathogen. Trials from areas with high incidence rates for infectious diseases indicated that the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induces in addition non-specific immunity against various pathogens and thereby reduces overall mortality more than would have been expected by just protecting from tuberculosis. Although recent trials produced conflicting results, it was suggested that BCG might protect from non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and could be used to bridge the time until a specific vaccine against novel respiratory diseases like COVID-19 is available. Methods: We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2011 and December 9th, 2022, providing evidence about non-specific effects after BCG vaccination, assessed their potential for bias, and meta-analyzed relevant clinical outcomes. We excluded RCTs investigating vaccination with an additional vaccine unless outcomes from a follow-up period before the second vaccination were reported. Results: Our search identified 16 RCTs including 34,197 participants. Vaccination with BCG caused an estimated 44% decrease in risk for respiratory infections (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39–0.82) with substantial heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 77%). There was evidence for a protective effect on all-cause mortality of 21% if follow-up was restricted to one year (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.99). We did not find evidence for an effect when we considered longer follow-up (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03). Infection-related mortality after BCG vaccination was reduced by 33% (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46–0.99), mortality for sepsis by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.93). There was no evidence for a protective effect of BCG vaccination on infections of any origin (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71–1.00), COVID-19 (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68–1.14), sepsis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55–1.10) or hospitalization (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91–1.11). Conclusions: According to these results, depending on the setting, vaccination with BCG provides time-limited partial protection against non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and may reduce mortality. These findings underline BCG’s potential (1) in pandemic preparedness against novel pathogens especially in developing countries with established BCG vaccination programs but limited access to specific vaccines; (2) in reducing microbial infections, antimicrobial prescriptions and thus the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for additional RCTs to clarify the circumstances under which BCG’s non-specific protective effects are mediated.},

The placebo group presented a COVID-19 cumulative incidence of 0.75% vs 0.52% of BCG. The Moreau strain also presented a higher incidence rate (1.60% × 0.22%). BCG did not show a protective hazard ratio against COVID-19. In addition, the log (immunoglobulin G) level against SARS-CoV-2 presented a higher increase in the BCG group, whether or not participants had COVID-19, but also without statistical significance.Our results suggest that BCG has a tendency of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and higher immunoglobulin G levels than placebo.

BCG has depicted long-lasting effects, reduction in mortality, and hospitalizations associated with various diseases in different age groups as per studies across Sweden, West Africa, Spain, and Indonesia. Clinical trials are in progress in Holland, Australia, and Germany to study its effects on COVID-19. Most Asian countries with childhood BCG vaccination programs have shown lower COVID-19-related per capita death rates. The MMR vaccination has shown a reduction in hospitalizations and COVID-19-related deaths in about 11 countries, and a randomized clinical trial has been proposed in New Orleans. Reasons such as inhibition of pulmonary inflammation and structural similarity have been cited for such consequences. BCG and MMR may serve to shorten the duration of infection, minimize harmful pathology, reduce hospitalization rates, and curb the spread of the disease, but more research is required to assess the associated risks, especially for the elderly and people with comorbidities who are prone to severe complications of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The goal of World Immunisation Week 2023 is to reach the millions of children worldwide who have not been vaccinated to catch-up on lost progress in essential immunisation. In 2021, approximately 25 million infants had not received important basic vaccines, and the number of unvaccinated children had increased by 5 million since 2019. This global decline in childhood vaccination has been most prevalent in low-income and middle-income countries, in which the burden of infectious diseases is highest. In these countries, infectious diseases are one of the leading causes of child death. Inequalities in socioeconomic status, education, and geographical access continue to impact vaccine effects and dropout rates. Providing novel vaccines to children in low-income and middle-income countries is one way to overcome these issues and substantially reduce the burden of infectious diseases. Children younger than 6 months have the highest burden of severe disease associated with respiratory syntactical virus (RSV) in some low-income and middle-income countries, as shown in 2023 by Bryan Nyawanda and colleagues in BMC Medicine. In The Lancet, You Li and colleagues showed via a systematic analysis that there were 3.6 million RSV-associated acute lower respiratory infection hospital admissions and 101,400 RSV-attributable overall deaths worldwide in children aged 0–60 months in 2019. However, no licenced vaccines for RSV exist currently. The only preventive product that is widely available is palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody used to passively immunise clinically vulnerable children and infants against RSV. However, a systematic review published by Rachel Wittenauer and colleagues in BMC Medicine in 2023 showed that the cost and requirement of access to a dose every month mean that palivizumab is a less appealing option in low-income and middle-income countries than a vaccine would be. Fortunately, development towards improved immunisation against RSV is ongoing, with multiple vaccine and antibody products for RSV prevention currently being tested. One promising area of development is immunisation of the birthing parent (also known as maternal vaccination). The PREPARE trial, the first phase 3 trial of a vaccine for RSV in birthing parents published by Shabir Madhi and colleagues in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2020, randomly assigned 4636 pregnant people with an expected delivery date near the start of the RSV season to receive a single intramuscular dose of either RSV vaccine or placebo. Conducted in multiple low-income, middle-income, and high-income countries, the primary outcome was RSV-associated, medically significant lower respiratory tract infection in the infants up to age 90 days. Although the vaccine did not meet its primary outcome, it was established to be safe and provided a proof-of-concept of maternal vaccination against RSV (medically significant lower respiratory tract infection was 1.5% in the vaccine group and 2.4% in the placebo group). Furthermore, the PREPARE trial showed long-term efficacy of maternal vaccination against other conditions, such as all-cause infant pneumonia, showing its importance in low-income and middle-income countries where vaccination coverage is most scarce. Even more common conditions, such as asthma, can be prevented via RSV vaccination of the birthing parent according to a modelling study published by Justin Ortiz and colleagues in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in 2023, which will further reduce the overall disease burden. However, the mechanisms of cross protection are unknown and worthy of further investigation. Fortunately, the overall disease burden has already been somewhat reduced by developments in vaccination and immunisation against other infectious diseases. For example, almost every child had been infected by a rotavirus before age 5 years and rotaviruses caused approximately 500 000 deaths and 2 million hospitalisations worldwide each year before the introduction of a preventive vaccine in 2006. This preventive vaccine also led to a global reduction in the incidence of rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis. In countries that have not yet introduced rotavirus vaccination, however, the disease burden and corresponding economic costs remain high. A modelling study published in The Lancet Global Health in 2021 evaluated the cost–benefit ratio of a rotavirus vaccine for children younger than 1 year in the Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Guinea, Somalia, and South Sudan. They reported that the benefit of vaccine introduction outweighed the costs in all countries. A survey of the genetic diversity of circulating strains of rotavirus A in Gabon, published in eBioMedicine in 2021, detailed high levels of antigenic variability, which further highlights the need to urgently introduce national rotavirus A vaccination programmes. An additional concern is incomplete protection against infection with the current generation of vaccines. RotaTeq and Rotarix, two of the four oral rotavirus vaccines prequalified for global use by WHO, had excellent efficacy in clinical trials in high-income countries, but vaccine efficacy was substantially diminished in trials conducted in low-income and middle-income countries, as reviewed by Benjamin Lee in Human Vaccines and Immunotherapics in 2021. This underperformance, however, is multifactorial, and might not be due to the vaccines themselves. For example, limitations in methods for measuring immune response and protection and not accounting for decreased natural susceptibility to rotavirus infections were both shown to decrease reported estimates of vaccine efficacy. Improving the methods of assessment of vaccine efficacy could lead to higher-quality research, results, and reduction of overall disease burden. As stated by Daniel Velasquez-Portocarrero and colleagues in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, additional vaccination strategies should be evaluated to overcome the suboptimal performance of current oral rotavirus vaccines in low-income and middle-income countries. Another infectious disease against which vaccination and immunisation would reduce the overall disease burden in low-income and middle-income countries is tuberculosis. Despite a reduction in tuberculosis cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence has begun to increase once again; 6.4 million new cases were reported worldwide in 2021. Tuberculosis is expected to soon return to being the deadliest infectious disease globally and, without treatment, the mortality rate from tuberculosis is high. Two-thirds of new tuberculosis cases occur in eight low-income and middle-income countries (ie, India, China, Indonesia, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, and South Africa) and although some candidate vaccines have potentially strong protection against tuberculosis, they require refrigerated storage, which is substantially more difficult to provide in low-income and middle-income settings than in high-income settings. In a randomised, double-blind, phase 1 clinical trial of healthy adults aged 18–48 years published by Zachary Sagawa and colleagues in Nature Communications in 2022, a thermostable vaccine candidate against tuberculosis was safe and well tolerated, and elicited robust immune responses. However, as this trial was conducted in adults in the USA, the extent to which these findings can be generalised to children in low-income and middle-income countries is questionable. Unfortunately, an analysis of notification data published in The Lancet Global Health by Lasith Ranasinghe and colleagues in 2022 found that COVID-19 has substantially affected childhood tuberculosis services, indicating that even if a vaccine was shown to be effective in children in low-income and middle-income countries, real-life administration to all children who need it would be difficult. Furthermore, according to Hazel Dockrell and Helen McShane in their 2022 eBioMedicine personal view, research and development of new tuberculosis vaccines has been slow because of poor funding, another setback to vaccine provision that disproportionately affects low-income and middle-income settings. However, a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis published in The Lancet Global Health by Leonardo Martinez and colleagues in 2022 showed that the only licenced vaccine against Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently, the BCG vaccine, protected infants and children younger than 5 years against all tuberculosis when results were stratified by age. Moreover, WHO announced in January, 2023, their plan to establish a new Tuberculosis Vaccine Accelerator Council. This council hopes to identify and overcome current issues in tuberculosis vaccine development. These commitments and developments are promising regarding increasing vaccination and reducing the burden of infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries. Although ongoing action and research make the future of immunisation look increasingly favourable, there is still a substantial deficit in the provision and administration of vaccines in low-income and middle-income countries. Global stakeholders should improve their collaboration with and support of researchers and clinicians in low-income and middle-income countries to establish safe and effective vaccines for children to reduce the burden of infectious diseases. Currently, African researchers are looking at ways to produce local vaccines, and the rest of the world should support this endeavour with funding and knowledge exchange. eBioMedicine welcomes all research and development in this field and encourages submissions from individuals from low-income and middle-income countries.},

	abstract = {Trained immunity is a long-term increase in responsiveness of innate immune cells, induced by certain infections and vaccines. During the last 3 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccines that induce trained immunity, such as BCG, MMR, OPV, and others, have been investigated for their capacity to protect against COVID-19. Further, trained immunity-inducing vaccines have been shown to improve B and T cell responsiveness to both mRNA- and adenovirus-based anti-COVID-19 vaccines. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection itself induces inappropriately strong programs of trained immunity in some individuals, which may contribute to the long-term inflammatory sequelae. In this review, we detail these and other aspects of the role of trained immunity in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. We also examine the learnings from the trained immunity studies conducted in the context of this pandemic and discuss how they may help us in preparing for future infectious outbreaks.

At the end of 2019, a new form of pneumonia was identified in China, and in January 2020, a new viral pathogen from the coronaviruses family was discovered and termed SARS-CoV-2. The infection caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus disease-19 (or COVID-19) and caused a major pandemic. In the 3 years since the start of the pandemic, hundreds of millions of people were infected with the new virus, and more than 5 million people lost their lives (https://covid19.who.int). Soon after the beginning of the pandemic, it became clear that dysregulation of immune responses played a very important role for the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Initially, most of the attention was centered on the clear hyperinflammatory profile that characterized many of the patients with severe forms of the disease.1Jouan Y. Baranek T. Si-Tahar M. Paget C.

This hyperinflammation-centric view of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 led to large clinical trials in severely ill patients, which resulted in the successful identification of several important approaches for immunomodulatory treatments, such as the use of steroids, as well as blockers of IL-1 or IL-6 bioactivity.4van de Veerdonk F.L.

In this respect, it has been shown that the overproduction of IL-6 can also have immunosuppressive effects on the antigen-presenting features of myeloid cells with decrease of HLA-DR expression,2Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J.

It has been therefore hypothesized that approaches that would boost innate immune responses from the beginning of the infection, even before antigen-specific T and B cell responses are activated, would likely improve the outcome of the patients.7Netea M.G.

Thus, 3 years into the pandemic, much has been learned on the importance of trained immunity for COVID-19, and a number of important conclusions can be drawn that can be used for a better preparedness against future pandemics. In this review, we present a summary of the studies performed during the pandemic on the trained immunity-inducing vaccines and their effects against COVID-19, as well as an overview of the long-term effects of COVID-19 itself and the new COVID-19 vaccines on trained immunity. We examine what we have learned and discuss how this knowledge on trained immunity may help us in preparing for future infectious outbreaks. Experimental animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infections developed early during the pandemic have proven useful in investigating the capacity of the BCG vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. In one study, it was reported that intravenous (i.v.) administration of BCG in mice induced protection of human-ACE2 transgenic mice against mortality in a model of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was mediated by reduced viral loads, tissue pathology, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cytokine production.23Hilligan K.L.

Such a more potent protection induced by i.v. administration of BCG has been demonstrated in other infectious models as well.31Darrah P.A. Zeppa J.J. Maiello P. Hackney J.A. Wadsworth 2nd, M.H.

It can be hypothesized that i.v. BCG provides a more direct engagement of the bone marrow compartment and at the level required to induce trained immunity in immune cell progenitors, which may explain this stronger effect. In parallel with the experimental studies, and due to the severity of the pandemic in 2020 and at the beginning of 2021, epidemiological studies and randomized trials with trained immunity-inducing vaccines were also initiated. Two hypotheses were under investigation: one that BCG given in childhood might protect against COVID-19 decades later and one that a recent BCG vaccination might protect against COVID-19. A number of initial epidemiological studies suggested that a program of BCG vaccination during childhood in particular geographical regions is associated with a low prevalence of COVID-19 and lower risk of severe COVID-19 in various countries.32Berg M.K.

Several randomized clinical trials investigating BCG vaccination effect on COVID-19 susceptibility have been initiated in 2020 and 2021. As severe COVID-19 patients are often characterized by hyperinflammation, a first important question was the safety of BCG vaccination (which can enhance innate immune responses). A retrospective study of recent BCG vaccination in healthy individuals demonstrated that BCG is safe with regard to COVID-19 severity,40Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J. Tsilika M. Moorlag S. Antonakos N.

Trained immunity could help tackle COVID-19 disease. Our objective was to analyze whether heat-killed Mycobacterium manresensis (hkMm), an environmental mycobacterium, induces trained immunity and confers protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this end, THP-1 cells and primary monocytes were trained with hkMm. The increased secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-10, metabolic activity, and changes in epigenetic marks suggested hkMm-induced trained immunity in vitro. Healthcare workers at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled into the MANRECOVID19 clinical trial (NCT04452773) and were administered Nyaditum resae (NR, containing hkMm) or placebo. No significant differences in monocyte inflammatory responses or the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were found between the groups, although NR modified the profile of circulating immune cell populations. Our results show that M. manresensis induces trained immunity in vitro but not in vivo when orally administered as NR daily for 14 days.

Here we addressed whether hkMm induces trained immunity in vitro and in vivo and assessed the impact of oral uptake of NR on SARS-CoV-2 infection and the course of COVID-19 disease (namely, incidence, severity, and absenteeism caused by the disease) in a cohort of highly exposed HCWs in Spain. The human monocytic THP-1 cell line has been widely used to model the function and regulation of human primary macrophages. Here we sought to establish a protocol of trained immunity in the THP-1 cell line using heat-killed BCG (hkBCG) and test whether hkMm was also capable of inducing an equivalent response. To this end, we examined two hallmarks of trained immunity, namely enhanced inflammatory secretion and shift of macrophage metabolism toward glycolysis. The standardized protocol is shown in Figure 1A. Initial priming of the macrophages with hkBCG or hkMm led to higher TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β expression than in untrained cells when they were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313, Figure 1B). Likewise, higher levels of TNF-α and IL-1β were observed when cells were challenged with heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (hk S. aureus) and inactivated (In) SARS-CoV-2, respectively (p = 0.0313, Figures 1C and 1D). In contrast, no differences were detected in IL-6 or IL-1β production when cells were rechallenged with hkS. aureus, in TNF-α or IL-6 production when cells were rechallenged with InSARS-CoV-2, or in TNF-α, IL-6, or IL-1β production after cells were stimulated with heat-killed M. tuberculosis (hkMtb) and In swine influenza virus (SIV) H1N1 (data not shown). Regarding metabolic activity, hkBCG- and hkMm-trained THP-1 cells showed increased levels of L(+)-Lactate (p = 0.0313, Figure 1E), although at this time point no differences in the expression of glycolytic enzymes were detected (Figure S1A). Taken together, these results suggest that hkMm induces trained immunity in vitro in THP-1 cells to the same extent as hkBCG. Furthermore, it is remarkable that when analyzing cell size, hkBCG- and hkMm-trained THP-1 cells appeared to be larger than untrained cells (p = 0.0152 and p = 0.0087, respectively Figure S1B)—an effect that was previously observed for β-glucan and BCG training.38Bekkering S. Blok B.A. Joosten L.A.B. Riksen N.P. Van Crevel R. Netea M.G. In vitro experimental model of trained innate immunity in human primary monocytes.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2016; 23: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar After confirming the capacity of M. manresensis to induce trained immunity in vitro in the monocyte-like THP-1 cell line, we tested whether it could also induce trained immunity in primary monocytes. Like hkBCG training, hkMm enhanced TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β production as compared to the control when monocytes were exposed to LPS (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0156, respectively, Figure 2A) and hkS. aureus (p = 0.0313, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0078, respectively, Figure 2B) as inflammatory stimuli. In addition, hkMm-trained monocytes showed greater TNF-α and IL-6 production when challenged with hkMtb as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313 and p = 0.0078, Figure 2C). However, stimulation with InSARS-CoV-2 and InSIV H1N1 had no effect on TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β production after the initial priming with hkBCG or hkMm (Figures 2D and 2E). hkMm-trained primary monocytes rechallenged with LPS, hkMtb, and InSARS-CoV-2 showed an increase in the production of IL-10, although this increase was not significant (Figures 2A–2E). Regarding IL-1Ra, no differences were detected in its production by either hkBCG- or hkMm-trained primary monocytes (Figures 2A–2E). With respect to metabolic activity, hkBCG- and hkMm-trained human monocytes increased L(+)-Lactate production (p = 0.0156, Figure 2F). Taken together, these results indicate that hkMm induces trained immunity in human primary monocytes in vitro by boosting metabolic functions and inflammatory responses against LPS, hkS. aureus, and hkMtb. Next, we analyzed the epigenetic marks of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β gene promoters, which have been proposed as key elements mediating long-term enhanced responses in trained immunity with BCG.39Bekkering S. Domínguez-Andrés J. Joosten L.A.B. Riksen N.P. Netea M.G. Trained immunity: reprogramming innate immunity in health and disease.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 39: 667-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar We applied chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to study the histone modifications associated with open/active chromatin, such as trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac). Increased H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels were found in the promoter regions of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β in primary monocytes trained with hkMm (Figures 3A and 3B , respectively). These observations suggest that chromatin is more active in the promoter regions of proinflammatory genes, thus leading to an increased expression and responsiveness to secondary stimuli. Moreover, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac levels were highly correlated for the IL-1β gene promoter (p value = 0.0083, ρ = 0.8333, Figure 3C), thus emphasizing the role of IL-1β in trained immunity. Overall, these results suggest that in vitro training with hkMm increases H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at the promoter sites of proinflammatory genes. The MANRECOVID19 clinical trial included 317 participants, of which 214 were in the NR group and 103 in the placebo group. The demographics and baseline characteristics of the participants are described in Table 1, and the professional categories of the HCWs who participated in the study are described in Table S2. A full description of participants is given in the flowchart in Figure 4. The main variable to assess efficacy was the cumulative incidence of documented SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by RT-PCR, rapid antigenic test (RAT), or serological blood test. The study procedures and variables collected at each visit are listed in Table S3. All participants who met inclusion criteria were studied as “intention to treat” (ITT) population. The “per protocol” (PP) population was composed of those participants with a confirmed negative result in the SARS-CoV-2 test before the start of the study who completed the final study visit without significant deviations from the protocol and had not received a COVID-19 vaccine before the end of the study. In the ITT population, 62 (19.6%) of the tests conducted were positive (Table S4), while 21 (10.6%) were positive in the PP population (Table S5). We found no significant differences in the positivity of the tests between the two treatment groups. Tables S6 and S7 show the type of tests conducted and the vaccinations of the ITT and the PP populations, respectively. The cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection did not differ between the two treatment arms for the ITT population (Figure 5A), as shown in the logistic regression model (odds ratio [OR] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–2.35) (Table S6). Women had a lower incidence of infection than men (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94–0.99). A higher number of comorbidities were associated with a higher incidence of infection (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.05–2.25). Previous vaccination (seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine) was also associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR 7.04, 95% CI 3.11–15.93). Receiving a comedication at baseline was associated with a lower incidence of infection (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.1–0.6). The rest of the variables showed no statistical significance. For the PP sample, we did not find differences in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection between the NR and placebo groups (Figure 5B) (OR 2.03, 95% CI 0.62–6.67, Table S7). Women had a lower incidence of infection than men (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.09–0.77). A higher BMI and previous seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine were associated with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03–1.30 and OR 8.28, 95% CI 2.62–26.11, respectively).Table 1Baseline characteristics of enrolled participantsOverallPlaceboNyaditum resae®p valueN (%)317103214Sex Male68 (21.5)17 (16.5)51 (23.8)0.179 Female249 (78.5)86 (83.5)163 (76.2)Age (mean (SD)), years45.31 (11.30)45.93 (11.95)45.01 (10.99)0.499Weight (mean (SD)), kg69.64 (14.63)68.83 (14.27)70.03 (14.82)0.494Height (mean (SD)), cm165.07 (9.03)164.22 (8.69)165.47 (9.18)0.249BMI (mean (SD)), kg/m225.50 (4.69)25.50 (4.90)25.50 (4.59)0.997Smoker status Smoker93 (29.3)33 (32.0)60 (28.0)0.751 Ex-smoker53 (16.7)16 (15.5)37 (17.3) Non-smoker171 (53.9)54 (52.4)117 (54.7)Comorbidities No172 (54.3)55 (53.4)117 (54.7)0.926 Yes145 (45.7)48 (46.6)97 (45.3)Number of comorbidities 0172 (54.3)55 (53.4)117 (54.7)0.830 139 (12.3)16 (15.5)23 (10.7) 283 (26.2)26 (25.2)57 (26.6) 318 (5.7)5 (4.9)13 (6.1) 44 (1.3)1 (1.0)3 (1.4) 51 (0.3)0 (0.0)1 (0.5)Respiratory diseases34 (10.7)14 (13.6)20 (9.3)0.342Asthma28 (8.8)9 (8.7)19 (8.9)1.000COPD1 (0.3)1 (1.0)0 (0.0)0.708Other respiratory diseases5 (1.6)4 (3.9)1 (0.4)0.071Cardiovascular diseases31 (9.8)9 (8.7)22 (10.3)0.817Hypertension24 (7.6)6 (5.8)18 (8.4)0.556Other cardiovascular com},

	abstract = {In March 2018, the Prime Minister of India, Mr Narendra Modi announced in the Delhi End Tuberculosis (TB) Summit that India had decided a target of ending TB five years ahead of the 2030 global Sustainable Development Goal, i.e., by the year 20251. This bold vision coming from the highest leadership in India was a turning point in the fight against TB in the country. The TB response in India no longer remained a responsibility of the national TB programme alone, but it transformed towards a whole-of-the-government and whole-of-the-society response. Funding for TB programme increased, and several innovative tools and approaches were developed and implemented in India’s response against TB2. Ending TB is a daunting task considering the huge burden in India, continued presence of the disease for centuries and slow declines in the incidence and mortality. However, TB is a disease that can be prevented, diagnosed and treated, so it is unacceptable that so many people die of TB. Few decades ago, richer countries in western Europe, North America, Australia and Japan have brought down their burden of TB substantially3. In 2021, 10.6 million people in the world developed active TB and 1.6 million died of it, a staggering mortality of 16 per cent4. TB kills more people than any other single infectious agent apart from COVID-19 in recent years (2020-2021). India is the highest TB burden country, accounting for 28 per cent of global TB incidence and 33 per cent of deaths4. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 2.8 million people in India developed TB and 0.5 million died of it4. Seemingly impossible targets unlock new ideas, promote business-unusual and bring in innovations at its best. This is what started to happen in India before the COVID-19 pandemic, but there were major setbacks during the two peak years of the pandemic (2020-2021)5. In 2022, the TB response in India seems to have bounced back and is now well poised for a final push towards ending TB. The Global Plan to End TB 2023-2030 identifies the priority actions and finances needed to end TB globally despite the setback due to the COVID-19 pandemic6. It identifies a comprehensive set of interventions to prevent, diagnose and treat TB and identifies the research needs. These globally identified priority actions need to be fast tracked in India because of India’s bold and ambitious target. How fast India can move towards ending TB will depend on continued political commitment, adequate financing and the pace at which innovations can be developed, introduced and scaled up. One of the major challenges is that many people with TB are either not diagnosed or treated, or their diagnosis is delayed. This is an important contributor to TB deaths and ongoing transmission7. Several innovations have developed in India to address this challenge. Access to diagnostic services has improved through innovative models of engagement with private healthcare sector and expanding the network of sites with rapid molecular tests8. To detect TB early, even at the sub-clinical stage, systematic active case finding campaigns are being implemented and focussed on pre-delineated vulnerable populations and hotspots9. New tools for TB screening and diagnosis have developed in India such as rapid molecular tests (Truenat by Molbio and Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR test kit by Mylab) and artificial intelligence (AI)-aided chest X-ray reads by qure.ai10–12. Further research is ongoing on innovations in testing specimen other than sputum for the diagnosis of TB and on faster and easier methods for genome sequencing. Mobile diagnostic vans have been designed with onboard AI-enabled ultra-portable hand-held X-rays and rapid molecular tests for community-based TB screening and diagnosis. Drones have been piloted to carry the specimen and drugs to the remote areas of the country13. Cough detection apps are in advanced stages of research to prompt people to seek care for their cough and to assist health workers to triage people with cough for TB testing14,15. In the area of TB treatment, India was one of the first countries to research and use digital adherence tools, particularly the medication sleeve-based mHealth solution called 99DOTS16. India is also planning to scale up the short six-month treatment course for drug-resistant TB called BPaL containing bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid after conducting a research study in India (unpublished) to compliment international evidence. For prevention, there are several candidate TB vaccines under research with five candidates in phase 3 clinical trials. Two of these five candidate vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials are being researched in India – the recombinant BCG vaccine called VPM1002 of Serum Institute of India and the inactivated mycobacterial vaccine called immuvac (MIP) of Indian Council of Medical Research and Cadila Pharmaceuticals17. A new effective vaccine has significant potential for impact as shown by Arinaminpathy et al18 in a paper in this issue of the IJMR. While waiting for a new effective vaccine India needs to scale up TB Preventive Treatment (TPT) using primarily the short 12-dose ‘3HP’ regimen to all eligible contacts, people living with HIV and other population groups at-risk. To address hesitancy of people and care providers to start TPT a ‘test-and-treat’ approach could be considered with TPT offered to people who test positive for TB infection. In this context, India has now developed a new and much improved skin test for TB infection called C-TB or Cy-TB test manufactured by Serum Institute of India19. Data are keys to guide the TB response, and in this context, India’s Nikshay system which further evolved in recent years is unique in the world in terms of its capabilities for real-time online handling of patient management data as well as programme data20. India has also designed several new innovations in measuring TB burden and developing targets for States and districts using the smart and unconventional methods such as by using drug sales data18. To support patients and their families, a new initiative was launched in September 2022 called the Prime Minister’s TB Free India Campaign21,22. It calls for individuals and organizations to adopt TB patients which means providing them monthly food baskets, vocational training and support for ancillary diagnosis and treatment. This is an innovation to break stigma, create awareness and bring in crowd funding through an all-of-society approach. The COVID-19 pandemic was a huge setback to India’s TB response, but there were also several lessons learnt23. Virtual programme management, community and home-based care, use of digital tools, testing at scale, contact tracing at scale and the priority given to airborne infection prevention and control are some of the lessons learnt. TB and COVID-19 have many similarities, both being airborne and droplet infections affecting primarily the respiratory system. The TB programme infrastructure and human resources contributed to the COVID-19 response because of these similarities. Considering the huge burden of TB in India and the ambitious vision to end TB by 2025, TB deserves even more urgency than COVID-19 in terms of faster research, quick regulatory approvals of new tools and aggressive scale up of interventions. Going forward, as the world and India embark on Pandemic Preparedness and Response, India should invest further on its TB programme to ensure that it has all the capacity, tools and innovations needed to become a launchpad to fight any future new airborne infection outbreak. India’s G20 Presidency in 2023 is an opportunity to push for G20 leadership and investments in innovations that have the dual purpose of defeating TB as well as preparing the world to face future pandemics.

	abstract = {Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is the only approved vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) prevention worldwide. BCG has an excellent protective effect on miliary tuberculosis and tuberculous meningitis in children or infants. Interestingly, a growing number of studies have shown that BCG vaccination can induce nonspecific and specific immunity to fight against other respiratory disease pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. The continuous emergence of variants of SARS-CoV-2 makes the protective efficiency of COVID-19-specific vaccines an unprecedented challenge. Therefore, it has been hypothesized that BCG-induced trained immunity might protect against COVID-19 infection. This study comprehensively described BCG-induced nonspecific and specific immunity and the mechanism of trained immunity. In addition, this study also reviewed the research on BCG revaccination to prevent TB, the impact of BCG on other non-tuberculous diseases, and the clinical trials of BCG to prevent COVID-19 infection. These data will provide new evidence to confirm the hypotheses mentioned above.},

Her past medical history was not contributory, and her grandmother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She was a nurse working for our hospital and received the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine 7 days earlier. Six days after vaccination, she developed erythema on her left upper arm. Physical examination revealed edematous, erythematous lesions on and around the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) inoculation site (Figure 1A). The white cell blood count was normal, as was the biochemical screen: WBC 5540/μl (60.8% neuts, 31.8% lymphs, 4.5% monos, 2.0% eos, and 0.9% basos), RBC 4.64 × 106/μl, HGB 14.1 g/dL, HCT 40.8%, PLT 10.1 × 104/μl, Alb 4.9 g/dL, AST 18 U/L, and ALT 12 IU/L. C-reacted protein (0.04 mg/dL) and antistreptolysin O (17 IU/mL) antibody levels were normal. Histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen (Figure 1B) demonstrated mild exocytosis and perivascular and periadnexal infiltration of lymphocytes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue (Figure 1C). Phenotype of these cells showed that most were characterized by CD3+ and CD8+ cells. Three days later, the lesions disappeared spontaneously. It is well known that erythema at the BCG inoculation site, like our case, is found in children with Kawasaki disease (KD).1 Verdori et al.2 found a 30-fold increased KD-like incidence in children in Italy through the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. However, KD surveillance team in Japan reported that no relationship was observed between the disease and COVID-19,3 and our case demonstrated no overt symptoms suggesting KD. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has been adapted for individuals 16 years of age and older since December 11, 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded the emergency use authorization to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age on May 10, 2021.4 Japan also started the vaccination for children aged 6 months to 4 years in October 2022. After its expansion to younger age, we have to pay attention to such reactions as a rash on the BCG inoculation site. We gratefully acknowledge the help of Professor Howard I. Maibach, MD.

Baßler K. et al.Western diet triggers NLRP3-dependent innate immune reprogramming.Cell. 2018; 172: 162-175.e14Google Scholar However, little is known about how diet-induced training affects diseases outcomes. It is well established that continuous WD enhances inflammatory responses to injury-induced colitis. Here, we demonstrate in mice that transient consumption of WD followed by a return to normal chow altered immune responses in the gut such that future inflammation because of injury or infection was reduced. Furthermore, this protective ‘training’ of gut-associated immunity by temporary consumption of WD was independent of gut microbe changes and occurred in both male and female mice. Mechanistically, we identified the cholesterol biosynthesis mevalonate pathway and macrophages as required mediators of the protective WD training effect. Together these results further support the benefit of adopting a healthy plant-based diet by WD consumers, because this change did not merely reverse deleterious effects of WD on gut inflammation, it revealed a beneficial immune training outcome of the prior WD-driven inflammatory response. Gut barrier, composed of mucus layer and epithelium tight junction proteins (TJPs) complexes, shields lamina propria and draining lymph nodes immune cells from over-activation.5Yoo W. Zieba J.K.

Barrier dysfunction has been highlighted as an initiation and promotion factor for gut inflammation.17Van der Post S. Jabbar K.S. Birchenough G. Arike L. Akhtar N. Sjovall H. Johansson M.E.V.

Smith M.I. et al.Increased intestinal permeability is associated with later development of crohn's disease.Gastroenterology. 2020; 159: 2092-2100.e5Google Scholar Indeed, mice receiving WD had shortened colons (Figure S1D), low-grade inflammation with increased gene expression for Th1 and Th17 markers (Figure S1E) and skewed cytokines profiles (Figure S1F). Nevertheless, the gene expression of Il22 and it induced antimicrobial peptide, e.g., RegIIIβ and RegIIIγ, shown no difference between group (Figure S1G). Concomitant with local low-grade inflammation, markers of immune activation were also observed in MLNs (Figure S1H). Of note, 4-week WD phenocopied the weight gain (Figure 1A), lower gut barrier molecules expression (Figure 1B) and higher Il17a but lower Il10 expression (Figures 1C and 1D) observed in long-term WD, demonstrating short-term WD feeding is sufficient to drive gut changes. The intestinal barrier is a rapidly self-renewing structure with a turnover period of 4–5 days for epithelial cells (5–7 days in human) and fast renewal of the mucus layers by the surface goblet cells.19Williams J.M. Duckworth C.A. Burkitt M.D. Watson A.J.M. Campbell B.J. Pritchard D.M. Epithelial cell shedding and barrier function: a matter of life and death at the small intestinal villus tip.Vet. Pathol. 2015; 52: 445-455Google Scholar WD is known to disrupt the gut barrier and evoke low-grade inflammation, but whether the barrier is repaired and whether low-grade inflammation is resolved after normal chow diet rest has yet to be explored. To tackle this question, we employed a training model by temporary WD exposure followed by 1-week normal chow resolution. To further rule out contributions of microbiota changes to any observed effects we then co-housed the WD-fed mice with control mice that had received with normal chow for a further 3 weeks (Figure 1E). Mice switched to normal diet gained less weight than those maintained on WD throughout (Figure 1F). Switching to normal diet also reversed colon shortening (Figure 1G). After normal diet “wash-out”, WD exposed mice (hereafter termed trained mice) had comparable body weight and colon length to control untrained mice (Figures 1F and 1G). Intriguingly, colon cytokines profile revealed markedly higher Il10 but lower Il17a expression in trained mice (Figure 1H), indicating an anti-inflammatory situation. In addition, trained mice revealed an enhanced intestinal barrier function: there were more goblet cells, thicker mucus (Figure 1I) and increased expression of Il13, core mucus structural components (e.g., Muc2, Clca1, and Ctsz) and TJPs (Figure 1J) in distal colon compared with untrained mice. The data so far suggest that WD feeding damages the gut barrier, and that subsequent inflammatory response and repair results in potentially enhanced barrier function. To test these concepts, we challenged mice receiving WD or that had been previously trained with transient WD with DSS to induce colitis. In a low-dose (1%) DSS treatment model (Figure 2A), mice maintained on WD showed increased weight loss (Figure 2B) and significantly shorter colon (Figure 2C) compared to mice receiving normal diet. Those results are in accordance with previous in vivo findings7Lee J.Y. Cevallos S.A. Byndloss M.X. Tiffany C.R. Olsan E.E. Butler B.P. Young B.M. Rogers A.W.L. Nguyen H. Kim K. et al.High-fat diet and antibiotics cooperatively impair mitochondrial bioenergetics to trigger dysbiosis that exacerbates pre-inflammatory bowel disease.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28: 273-284.e6Google Scholar as well as observational studies from human population that WD or obesity is an important risk factor for IBD.3Agrawal T. Acquah I. Dey A.K. Glassner K. Abraham B. Blankstein R. Virani S.S. Blaha M.J. Valero-Elizondo J. Mehta N. et al.Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in a nationally representative adult population with inflammatory bowel disease without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.Am. J. Prev. Cardiol. 2021; 6: 100171Google Scholar We next tested the response of trained mice to a dose of DSS that induces frank inflammation and weight loss in normal diet fed mice (2% DSS) (Figure 2D). In agreement with markers for better gut barrier function and reduced inflammation, mice that received transient WD training showed less body mass loss (Figure 2E) and longer colons (Figure 2F). Histological analysis of distal colon confirmed reduced epithelium damage (Figure 2G) and lower histologic score (Figure 2H) after DSS treatment in trained mice. Furthermore, colon from those trained mice exhibited lower Il17a, Il10, Tnfa, Il1b, Il6 and Cd206 expression (Figure 2I). Barrier related genes expression, especially goblet cell-specific genes (e.g., Muc2, Agr2 and Spdef), were relatively high at mRNA level in DSS treated untrained mice (Figure 2J), which may suggest a compensatory mechanism for destruction. These data support the conclusion that consumption of WD causes inflammation and barrier dysfunction that can be repaired on return to a healthier normal diet, and in fact this transient diet-driven inflammatory response provides future benefits to gut health by increasing resistance to injury-driven colitis. Exacerbation of colitis severity by WD consumption has been reported in other colitis models.20An J. Zhao X. Wang Y. Noriega J. Gewirtz A.T. Zou J. Western-style diet impedes colonization and clearance of Citrobacter rodentium.PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17: e1009497Google Scholar Citrobacter rodentium (C. rodentium) is an attaching and effacing (A/E) bacterial pathogen that mimics human diarrheagenic enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC).21Mullineaux-Sanders C.

Microbiol. 2019; 17: 701-715Google Scholar We confirmed that WD-fed mice had more severe colitis outcomes during C. rodentium infection (Figures 3A–3C ). Considering the benefits of prior WD training on DSS injury-induced colitis, we queried if the same protection could be generated in infection-related colitis (Figure 3D). Bacterial burden monitoring showed trained mice had significantly lower C. rodentium load beginning at early stages of infection (Figure 3E). Lower pathogen burden was associated with significantly less reduction in body mass (Figure 3F), longer colon and less damage (Figure 3G) after infection, indicating reduced colitis in trained mice. Gene expression analysis of trained mice colon further supported a reduced local inflammatory response compared with untrained mice, with lower expression of Il17a, Il10, Tnfa, Il6, and iNOS (Figure 3H). Although Clca1 expression was higher, goblet cell-specific genes and Ctsz expression was lower in trained mice after infection (Figure 3I). However, the gene expression of Il22, Reg3β, and Reg3γ was not influenced by WD training (Figure 3J) The aforementioned findings demonstrate that WD also induced mild colitis. Therefore, we tested if WD training also works for future WD challenge (Figure S2A). Trained mice had a trend to lose weight during secondary round of WD but did not reach significance (Figures S2B and S2C). Besides, colon length (Figure S2D), colon inflammatory markers (Figure S2E) and colon barrier markers (Figure S2F) were all comparable between trained and untrained mice. Overall, despite these different pathogenic mechanisms, we found that better outcomes after WD training are common in injury-induced and infection-related colitis model. Gut microbiota are sensitive to diet, and WD high in fat but low in fiber lacks nutrients to support gut microbiota diversity.20An J. Zhao X. Wang Y. Noriega J. Gewirtz A.T. Zou J. Western-style diet impedes colonization and clearance of Citrobacter rodentium.PLoS Pathog. 2021; 17: e1009497Google Scholar In addition, microbial dysbiosis is proposed to be a central mechanism for how WD exacerbates colitis.23Howard E.J. Lam T.K.T. Duca F.A. The gut microbiome: connecting diet, glucose homeostasis, and disease.Annu. Rev. Med. 2022; 73: 469-481Google Scholar We therefore queried if gut flora changes contributed to WD training induced protection on colitis. Co-housing of mice is known to allow sharing of microbiota populations between the mice. Previously WD-trained mice were protected from subsequent colitis whether they were co-housed or not co-housed with control mice that had only received normal chow diet (Figures S3A–S3D). To define the composition of gut microbiota, we performed fecal 16s rRNA sequencing among chow diet, 8-week WD, untrained and trained mice (Figure 1E). Consist with previous publications,24Stanislawski M.A. Dabelea D. Lange L.A. Wagner B.D. Lozupone C.A. Gut microbiota phenotypes of obesity.NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes. 2019; 5: 18Google Scholar WD resulted in a substantial reduction in microbiota Alpha diversity by Rank Abundance Curve (Figure 4A) and Simpson and Shannon Diversity Index (Figures 4B and S3E), but no significant difference was found among chow diet, untrained and trained mice on Alpha diversity. Based on weighted unifrac distance, minimal difference was found between trained and untrained mice whereas WD mice showed general disruption of the fecal bacterial community structure to chow diet mice (Figures 4C and S3F). Later Principal Component Analysis (Figure 4D) and Principal Co-ordinates Analysis (Figure 4E) further confirmed comparable Beta diversity between trained and untrained mice. Analysis of molecular variance (Amova) of Unifrac Distance showed the difference between trained and untrained mice did not reach significance (Figure 4F). Best discriminated taxa in each groups was presented as Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (Figure 4G), and difference was tested by species level (Figure 4H). Although there were a few differences (e.g., Helicobacter typhlonius), overall trained mice and untrained mice harbor similar gut microbes. Altogether, no obvious difference in gut flora between trained and untrained mice suggested the training benefits are not driven primarily by changes in gut microbes. Except for gut microbiota dysbiosis, WD also leads to metabolic changes. Being the biggest metabolic organ, the liver plays a vital role for lipid metabolism and protein synthesis (especially albumin synthesis). It is well known that WD is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) which can further progress to NASH.2Baratta F. Pastori D. Polimeni L. Bucci T. Ceci F. Calabrese C. Ernesti I. Pannitteri G. Violi F. Angelico F. Del Ben M. Adherence to mediterranean diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: effect on insulin resistance.Am. J. Gastroenterol. 2017; 112: 1832-1839Google Scholar Even after only 4 weeks WD feeding, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were elevated significantly (Figure 5A), indicating the injury of hepatocytes. At the same time, though total protein and albumin levels shown no difference, increased cholesterol level but deceased triglyceride level were found after short-term WD feeding (Figures 5B and 5C), which were further confirmed in 8-week WD fed mice (Figure S4A). In addition, the expression of key enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis mevalonate pathway (Figure S4B), like HMG-CoA reductase (coded by Hmgcr), mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, as well as mevalonate biphospho decarboxylase, changed markedly after WD feeding in both colon and MLNs (Figures 5D and 5E), indicating an adaptation for increased fat and carbohydrates intake. Based on those results, we used statin, an inhibitor for mevalonate pathway rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, in drinking water to prevent WD accompanied hypercholesterolemia in our training model (Figure S5A). For mice receiving chow diet, statin treatment made no influence on weight gaining, but statin reduced weight gaining for WD feeding mice (Figures 5F, 5G, S4C, and S4D). However, statin treatment had no beneficial on WD induced colon inflammation as measured by colon length (Figure S4E). Later, when DSS was introduced (Figure S5A), neither body weight (Figure S5B) nor colon length (Figure S5C) showed any difference among trained mice with or without statin treatment during training period. Cytokines in colon also had similar expression (Figure S5D), but barrier marker expression was reversed (Figure S5E). Similarly, 4-week statin treatment did not reverse the protective effects in the C. rodentium colitis model (Figures S6A–S6E). These results suggest that WD induced colon low-grade inflammation and later training benefits are independent of enhanced cholesterol metabolism during WD feeding. Altered cholesterol metabolism has been associated with innate immune cell training to inflammatory stimuli, and mevalonate is important for trained myeloid cells to more effectively combat a new infection.25Bekkering S. Arts R.J.W. Novakovic B. Kourtzelis I. van der Heijden C. Li Y. Popa C.D. Ter Horst R. van Tuijl J. Netea-Maier R.T. et al.Metabolic induction of trained immunity through the mevalonate pathway.Cell. 2018; 172: 135-146.e9Google Scholar To fully elucidate if the mevalonate pathway involved in WD training, we treated mice with statin throughout the training and rest period (Figure 5F). Despite statin treatment, body weight (Figure 5G) and serum AST, ALT, TP, ALB, and lipids (Figure 5H) were comparable among trained and untrained mice after the chow diet rest. Unexpectedly, liver function and serum lipids profile analyses demonstrated that WD only led to a temporary liver cell injury and hypercholesterolemia that quickly recovered during the 4-week rest period on normal chow, even without statin treatment (Figures 5H–5J). Furthermore, extending statin treatment made no difference to baseline colon length (Figure 5K), as well as inflammatory and intestinal barrier markers (Figures S7A–S7C), except for a relatively higher Hmgcr expression (Figure 5L). However, when challenged with DSS, training benefits were totally abrogated in statin-treated WD trained mice: obvious weight loss (Figure 5M) and severe colitis revealed that those mice had similar outcomes with untrained mice (Figures 5N–5Q). Together, these data indicate that the mevalonate pathway is essential for WD-induced training protection on subsequent colitis. The mevalonate pathway plays an essential role for the induction of trained immunity by inflammatory stimuli. Of interest, it is not thought to be the synthesis of cholesterol but rather its intermediate product mevalonic acid that is critical to induce trained immunity. Considering the non-specific protection (a main characteristic of trained immunity) of WD training, and that it appears to be dependent on the mevalonate pathway but not the levels of systemic cholesterol, we hypothesized that trained immunity may act as a key mechanism in WD training induced protection on colitis. Recently, Christ et al. shown that WD truly established long-lasting memory in Ldlr−/− mice myeloid cells, which increased proliferation and enhanced innate immune responses in vitro even mice were shifted back to chow diet.16Christ A.

Next, to understand the mechanisms of WD training, RNA-seq was performed. We harvested colon tissues from CD, WD, and trained mice. Notably, we found a significant changes in the colons of mice fed on WD compared with CD mice, and those changes was markedly restored in training mice, especially for macrophages marker genes (Figure 6B). RT-PCR further confirmed our RNA sequencing findings that shown no matter of long-term 16-week (Figures S8A and S8B) or short-term 4-week WD (Figures S8C and S8D) changed macrophage polarization significantly in both colon and MLNs. However, those macrophages markers were comparable between trained and untrained mice (Figure S8E), suggesting the macrophage activation status returns to the baseline state from primed immune responses (a critical point for trained immunity27Divangahi M.

Next, the training effects of saturated fat on macrophages was explored by using palmitic acid (PA) in vitro. Although cytokines production came back to normal level after rest, PA pre-treated macrophages shown stronger phenotype during LPS re-challenge (Figure 6C), suggesting macrophages might be involved in our WD training model. Macrophage, the most well-studied innate immune cell in trained immunity, are critical for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and for the continuous renewal of intestinal epithelial cells and mucus in the intestinal tract.28Na Y.R.

The requirement for macrophages in WD trained colitis protection was tested by injecting clodronate liposomes to deplete macrophages during WD period.29Van Rooijen N. Hendrikx E.

Clodronate administration resulted in reduced weight gain, but these mice recovered (Figure 7B) and had similar colon length (Figure 7C) compared to the control liposome group by the end of the rest period. Following DSS or C. rodentium challenge, trained mice with blank liposome injection had better colitis outcomes than untrained mice with PBS injection as before.

	abstract = {In a recent study of our group with the acronym ACTIVATE, Bacillus Calmete-Guérin (BCG) vaccination reduced the occurrence of new infections compared to placebo vaccination in the elderly. Most benefit was found for respiratory infections. The ACTIVATE-2 study was launched to assess the efficacy of BCG vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this multicenter, double-blind trial, 301 volunteers aged 50 years or older were randomized (1:1) to be vaccinated with BCG or placebo. The trial end points were the incidence of COVID-19 and the presence of anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies, which were both evaluated through 6 months after study intervention. Results revealed 68% relative reduction of the risk to develop COVID-19, using clinical criteria or/and laboratory diagnosis, in the group of BCG vaccine recipients compared with placebo-vaccinated controls, during a 6-month follow-up (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.79). In total, eight patients were in need of hospitalization for COVID-19: six in the placebo group and two in the BCG group. Three months after study intervention, positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were noted in 1.3% of volunteers in the placebo group and in 4.7% of participants in BCG-vaccinated group. These data indicate that BCG vaccination confers some protection against possible COVID-19 among patients older than 50 years with comorbidities. BCG vaccination may be a promising approach against the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {<h2>Summary</h2><h3>Background</h3> BCG vaccination prevents severe childhood tuberculosis (TB) and was introduced in South Africa in the 1950s. It is hypothesised that BCG trains the innate immune system by inducing epigenetic and functional reprogramming, thus providing non-specific protection from respiratory tract infections. We evaluated BCG for reduction of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 in healthcare workers in South Africa. <h3>Methods</h3> This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial recruited healthcare workers at three facilities in the Western Cape, South Africa, unless unwell, pregnant, breastfeeding, immunocompromised, hypersensitivity to BCG, or undergoing experimental COVID-19 treatment. Participants received BCG or saline intradermally (1:1) and were contacted once every 4 weeks for 1 year. COVID-19 testing was guided by symptoms. Hospitalisation, COVID-19, and respiratory tract infections were assessed with Cox proportional hazard modelling and time-to-event analyses, and event severity with post hoc Markovian analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04379336. <h3>Findings</h3> Between May 4 and Oct 23, 2020, we enrolled 1000 healthcare workers with a median age of 39 years (IQR 30–49), 70·4% were female, 16·5% nurses, 14·4% medical doctors, 48·5% had latent TB, and 15·3% had evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Hospitalisation due to COVID-19 occurred in 15 participants (1·5%); ten (66·7%) in the BCG group and five (33·3%) in the placebo group, hazard ratio (HR) 2·0 (95% CI 0·69–5·9, <i>p</i> = 0·20), indicating no statistically significant protection. Similarly, BCG had no statistically significant effect on COVID-19 (<i>p</i> = 0·63, HR = 1·08, 95% CI 0·82–1·42). Two participants (0·2%) died from COVID-19 and two (0·2%) from other reasons, all in the placebo group. <h3>Interpretation</h3> BCG did not protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 infection or related severe COVID-19 disease and hospitalisation. <h3>Funding</h3> Funding provided by EDCTP, grant number RIA2020EF-2968.

The tuberculosis BCG vaccine may provide heterologous protection against nontuberculous infections and has been proposed as a potential preventive strategy against COVID-19.In this multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned older adults (aged ≥60 years; n = 2014) to intracutaneous vaccination with BCG vaccine (n = 1008) or placebo (n = 1006). The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of respiratory tract infections (RTIs) that required medical intervention, during 12 months of follow-up. Secondary end points included the incidence of COVID-19, and the effect of BCG vaccination on the cellular and humoral immune responses.The cumulative incidence of RTIs requiring medical intervention was 0.029 in the BCG-vaccinated group and 0.024 in the control group (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.26 [98.2% confidence interval, .65-2.44]). In the BCG vaccine and placebo groups, 51 and 48 individuals, respectively tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with polymerase chain reaction (subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.053 [95% confidence interval, .71-1.56]). No difference was observed in the frequency of adverse events. BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced cytokine responses after influenza, and also partially associated after SARS-CoV-2 stimulation. In patients diagnosed with COVID-19, antibody responses after infection were significantly stronger if the volunteers had previously received BCG vaccine.BCG vaccination had no effect on the incidence of RTIs, including SARS-CoV-2 infection, in older adult volunteers. However, it improved cytokine responses stimulated by influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and induced stronger antibody titers after COVID-19 infection.EU Clinical Trials Register 2020-001591-15 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04417335.},

There is ample evidence that vaccines such as bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induce protective innate immune memory responses (trained immunity) against heterologous pathogens. Here we show that while BCG vaccination significantly reduces morbidity and mortality against influenza A virus (IAV), it fails to provide protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to unique pulmonary vasculature damage facilitating viral dissemination to other organs, including the bone marrow (BM), a central site for BCG-mediated trained immunity. Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism.

Finally, monocytes from BCG-vaccinated individuals mount an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response is minimal following SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data suggest that the protective capacity of BCG vaccination is contingent on viral pathogenesis and tissue tropism. While the concept of the innate memory response (termed trained immunity) is “young,” the evidence of innate memory in host defense against diverse infectious diseases is “old” (Divangahi et al., 2021Divangahi M. Aaby P. Khader S.A. Barreiro L.B. Bekkering S. Chavakis T. Van Crevel R. Curtis N. Dinardo A.R. Dominguez-Andres J. et al.Trained immunity, tolerance, priming and differentiation: distinct immunological processes.Nat. Immunol. 2021; 22: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A growing body of literature indicates that live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), measles-containing vaccines, smallpox, and oral poliovirus vaccines (OPVs) induce cross-protection against other infectious diseases (Namakula et al., 2020Namakula R. De Bree L.C.J. Th A.T. Netea M.G. Cose S. Hanevik K. Monocytes from neonates and adults have a similar capacity to adapt their cytokine production after previous exposure to BCG and beta-glucan.PLoS One. 2020; 15: e0229287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). While pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in LAVs activate an array of innate immune responses via pattern recognition receptors (e.g., Toll-like receptors [TLRs] or NODs), the basis for using adjuvants in non-live vaccines (e.g., inactivated vaccines against influenza) is to enhance the activity of innate immunity. Many studies have shown that BCG vaccination provides heterologous protection against unrelated pathogens. For example, BCG vaccination in newborn children is associated with protection against not only tuberculosis but also respiratory tract infections, neonatal sepsis, and all-cause mortality (Aaby et al., 2011Aaby P. Roth A. Ravn H. Napirna B.M. Rodrigues A. Lisse I.M. Stensballe L. Diness B.R. Lausch K.R. Lund N. et al.Randomized trial of BCG vaccination at birth to low-birth-weight children: beneficial nonspecific effects in the neonatal period?.J.

Vaccinations against smallpox and tuberculosis are associated with better long-term survival: a Danish case-cohort study 1971-2010.Int. J. Epidemiol. 2017; 46: 695-705PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, both BCG and polio vaccinations at birth lead to 32% lower mortality than BCG vaccination alone, indicating that OPV has an additional beneficial effect on mortality (Lund et al., 2015Lund N. Andersen A. Hansen A.S. Jepsen F.S. Barbosa A. Biering-Sorensen S. Rodrigues A. Ravn H. Aaby P. Benn C.S. The effect of oral polio vaccine at birth on infant mortality: a randomized trial.Clin. Infect Dis. 2015; 61: 1504-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pre-clinical data in murine models of infection further support these observations as it has been shown that BCG vaccination is associated with protection against fungal infections (e.g., Candida albicans) (Van 'T Wout et al., 1992Van 'T Wout J.W. Poell R. Van Furth R. The role of BCG/PPD-activated macrophages in resistance against systemic candidiasis in mice.Scand. J.

[Effect of Bacillus Callmette Guerin (BCG) on the receptivity of nude mice to Schistosoma mansoni].C R. Seances Soc. Biol. Fil. 1978; 172: 902-904PubMed Google Scholar), as well as DNA and RNA viruses (e.g., herpes and influenza virus) (Hippmann et al., 1992Hippmann G. Wekkeli M. Rosenkranz A.R. Jarisch R. Götz M.

Boosting efferocytosis in alveolar space using BCG vaccine to protect host against influenza pneumonia.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0180143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that BCG vaccination in healthy adults is associated with protection against human experimental models of yellow fever (Arts et al., 2018Arts R.J.W. Moorlag S. Novakovic B.

Thus, epidemiological studies as well as pre-clinical and clinical data all support the cross-protective effects of BCG vaccination (Namakula et al., 2020Namakula R. De Bree L.C.J. Th A.T. Netea M.G. Cose S. Hanevik K. Monocytes from neonates and adults have a similar capacity to adapt their cytokine production after previous exposure to BCG and beta-glucan.PLoS One. 2020; 15: e0229287Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, despite several large, ongoing clinical trials of BCG vaccination against the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the protective efficacy of BCG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains unknown. Previous studies have shown that intraperitoneal and intranasal (i.n.) BCG vaccinations provide protection in murine models of IAV infection (Mukherjee et al., 2017Mukherjee S. Subramaniam R. Chen H. Smith A. Keshava S. Shams H. Boosting efferocytosis in alveolar space using BCG vaccine to protect host against influenza pneumonia.PLoS One. 2017; 12: e0180143Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Spencer et al., 1977Spencer J.C.

Infect Dis. 1977; 136: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As we have recently shown that systemic (intravenous [i.v.]) BCG vaccination induces trained immunity (Kaufmann et al., 2018Kaufmann E. Sanz J. Dunn J.L. Khan N. Mendonca L.E. Pacis A. Tzelepis F. Pernet E. Dumaine A. Grenier J.C. et al.BCG educates hematopoietic stem cells to generate protective innate immunity against tuberculosis.Cell. 2018; 172 (e19): 176-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we vaccinated wild-type C57BL/6J mice with BCG i.v.. Four weeks after BCG-i.v. vaccination, mice were challenged with a lethal or sublethal dose of IAV i.n. (Figure 1A ). Remarkably, BCG-vaccinated mice showed a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality after IAV infection (Figure 1B). Likewise, the lung viral load was significantly lower at day 3 post IAV infection in BCG-i.v.-vaccinated mice compared with nonvaccinated controls (Figure 1C). To test whether BCG vaccination likewise induces protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, we vaccinated transgenic mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor (B6.Cg-Tg(K18-ACE2)2Prlmn/J) with BCG subcutaneously (s.c.)—which is the equivalent of intradermal BCG vaccination in humans—or i.v. At 4 weeks post vaccination, we i.n. infected the vaccinated and nonvaccinated control K18-hACE2 mice with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2/SB2 (lineage B.4) (Figure 1D). However, we did not observe differences in morbidity and mortality between vaccinated and control groups (Figure 1E). In K18-hACE2 mice, a low level of hACE2 expression is detectable in the brain, and i.n. exposure to SARS-CoV-2 leads to rapid and severe neurological disorders that lead to death (Kumari et al., 2021Kumari P. Rothan H.A. Natekar J.P. Stone S. Pathak H. Strate P.G. Arora K. Brinton M.A. Kumar M. Neuroinvasion and encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 in K18-hACE2 mice.Viruses. 2021; 13: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To overcome this limitation, we next infected the hACE2 mice intratracheally (i.t.) with SARS-CoV-2/SB2 to bypass the access of the virus to the brain via the olfactory system. However, BCG vaccination had no significant impact on either morbidity and survival (Figure S1A) or pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 replication at either day 3 or 5 post i.t. infection with lethal or sublethal doses, respectively (Figure 1F). Similarly, no differences in the systemic myeloid cell numbers were observed (Figure S1B, Table S1). Given the limitations of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice expressing non-physiological levels of hACE2 receptor (McCray et al., 2007McCray P.B. Pewe L. Wohlford-Lenane C. Hickey M. Manzel L. Shi L. Netland J. Jia H.P. Halabi C. Sigmund C.D. et al.Lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of BCG vaccination on IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infections in a Syrian golden hamster model (Chan et al., 2020Chan J.F. Zhang A.J. Yuan S. Poon V.K. Chan C.C. Lee A.C. Chan W.M. Fan Z. Tsoi H.W. Wen L. et al.Simulation of the clinical and pathological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a golden Syrian hamster model: implications for disease pathogenesis and transmissibility.Clin. Infect Dis. 2020; 71: 2428-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Syrian golden hamsters naturally express ACE2 receptor, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and develop a moderate form of COVID-19-like disease (Imai et al., 2020Imai M. Iwatsuki-Horimoto K. Hatta M. Loeber S. Halfmann P.J. Nakajima N. Watanabe T. Ujie M. Takahashi K. Ito M. et al.Syrian hamsters as a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2 infection and countermeasure development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2020; 117: 16587-16595Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Likewise, they are moderately susceptible to IAV infection (Iwatsuki-Horimoto et al., 2018Iwatsuki-Horimoto K. Nakajima N. Ichiko Y. Sakai-Tagawa Y. Noda T. Hasegawa H. Kawaoka Y. Syrian hamster as an animal model for the study of human influenza virus infection.J. Virol. 2018; 92 (e01693–17)Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At day 3 post IAV infection (i.n.) (Figure 2A ), BCG-i.v.-vaccinated Syrian golden hamsters displayed significantly lower pulmonary viral load (Figure 2B) and less weight loss (Figure S2A) compared with nonvaccinated controls. We then infected BCG (s.c. and i.v.)-vaccinated Syrian golden hamsters with SARS-CoV-2/SB2 strain (i.n.) (Figure 2C). In contrast to IAV infection, there were no significant differences in weight loss between BCG-vaccinated and nonvaccinated hamsters after SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 2D). Additionally, BCG vaccination had no effect on pulmonary viral loads at day 3 and 5 post infection, as determined by TCID50 (Figure 2E), qPCR (Brandolini et al., 2021Brandolini M. Taddei F. Marino M.M. Grumiro L. Scalcione A. Turba M.E. Gentilini F. Fantini M. Zannoli S. Dirani G. Sambri V. Correlating qRT-PCR, dPCR and viral titration for the identification and quantification of SARS-CoV-2: a new approach for infection management.Viruses. 2021; 13: 1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) (Figure S2B), and immunofluorescence (Figure 2F). The total lung leukocyte numbers were also similar between groups, with the exception of higher numbers in the BCG-i.v.-vaccinated animals after 3 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S2C). This increase was also reflected in the cellular populations of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung, spleen, and blood (Figure S2D, Table S1). Recently, sequence analyses of SARS-CoV-2/SB2 strain revealed several mutations within the spike coding region (Banerjee et al., 2020Banerjee A. Nasir J.A. Budylowski P. Yip L. Aftanas P. Christie N. Ghalami A. Baid K. Raphenya A.R. Hirota J.A. et al.Isolation, sequence, infectivity, and replication kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.Emerg. Infect Dis. 2020; 26: 2054-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, we next infected BCG-vaccinated (s.c. or i.v.) or nonvaccinated Syrian golden hamsters with another strain of SARS-CoV-2 that is more similar to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain isolated in Wuhan, China (SARS-CoV-2/RIM-1, formerly known as SARS-CoV-2/cp13.32, lineage B.1.147; Murall et al., 2021Murall C.L. Fournier E. Galvez J.H. N'guessan A. Reiling S.J. Quirion P.O. Naderi S. Roy A.M. Chen S.H. Stretenowich P. et al.A small number of early introductions seeded widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Québec, Canada.Genome Med. 2021; 13: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar; Table S2). Like in SARS-CoV-2/SB2 infection, BCG vaccination had no impact on morbidity or lung viral loads in Syrian golden hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2/RIM-1 (Figures 2G–2H and S2E). Likewise, serum interferon (IFN)-β and interleukin (IL)-6 levels showed no differences between SARS-CoV-2/SB2 and RIM-1 infections (Figures S2F–S2G). In contrast to the mild disease phenotype displayed by Syrian golden hamsters, Roborovski hamsters develop severe disease and can succumb to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Trimpert et al., 2020Trimpert J. Vladimirova D. Dietert K. Abdelgawad A. Kunec D. Dökel S. Voss A. Gruber A.D. Bertzbach L.D. Osterrieder N. The Roborovski dwarf hamster is A highly susceptible model for a rapid and fatal course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Cell Rep. 2020; 33: 108488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, similar to the Syrian golden hamsters, BCG vaccination (s.c. or i.v.) did not provide any protection against sublethal or lethal doses of SARS-CoV-2/RIM-1 infection in Roborovski hamsters when infected at 4 weeks post vaccination (Figures 3A–3D and S3A–S3C), or when infected with a sublethal dose of SARS-CoV-2/RIM-1 at 6 months post BCG vaccination (Figures S3D–S3E). Collectively, these data indicate that BCG vaccination fails to provide protection against mild or severe forms of infection with SARS-CoV-2. To investigate why BCG vaccination offers protection against IAV but not SARS-CoV-2 infections, we conducted in-depth comparative lung histological analyses. Our data indicate that after sublethal or lethal IAV infection, BCG-vaccinated mice revealed less lung damage in comparison with nonvaccinated mice (Figure 4A , Table S1). In contrast, BCG vaccination in K18-hACE2 mice did not improve lung pathology at days 1, 3, or 5 following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure 4B and Table S1). Likewise, after SARS-CoV-2 infection in BCG-vaccinated and nonvaccinated Syrian golden hamsters that exhibit only a clinically mild disease phenotype, severe lung lesions were observed, with extensive damage to the pulmonary vasculature after 5 days of infection (Figure 4C and Table S1). Pulmonary hemorrhage also occurs in 6-month BCG-vaccinated and nonvaccinated Roborovski hamsters at day 3 post sublethal SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figure S4A). In particular, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection presented with (1) focal vasculitis and profound perivascular inflammatory infiltrates as well as severe endotheliitis; (2) pulmonary hemorrhage; and (3) a large quantity of lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs. Vascular damage is relatively unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection as it is not frequently described in other pulmonary infections. In line with these findings, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, and endothelial cells of a patient who died of COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Figure 4D). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 within the endothelial cells is consistent with another study (Varga et al., 2020Varga Z. Flammer A.J. Steiger P. Haberecker M. Andermatt R. Zinkernagel A.S. Mehra M.R.

Systematic reviews of the lung histopathological reports also identified that microthrombi are a dominant feature of COVID-19 patients compared with patients with H1N1 influenza (Bonaventura et al., 2021Bonaventura A.

While the presence of other pulmonary viruses, such as IAV, in extrapulmonary tissues is rare, SARS-CoV-2 and extensive inflammation have been detected in kidneys, liver, heart, and brain, implicating the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 from pulmonary endothelial damage. SARS-CoV-2 viremia (Di Cristanziano et al., 2020Di Cristanziano V. Meyer-Schwickerath C. Eberhardt K.A. Rybniker J. Heger E. Knops E. Hallek M. Klein F. Holtick U. Jung N.

Thus, we next hypothesized that viral dissemination secondary to pulmonary vascular damage impairs BCG-mediated trained immunity against SARS-CoV-2. We and others have recently shown that, in both mice and humans, BM is the site of BCG-induced trained immunity (Kaufmann et al., 2018Kaufmann E. Sanz J. Dunn J.L. Khan N. Mendonca L.E. Pacis A. Tzelepis F. Pernet E. Dumaine A.

Interestingly, we have also demonstrated that access of a pathogen into the BM can prevent trained immunity (Khan et al., 2020Khan N. Downey J. Sanz J. Kaufmann E. Blankenhaus B. Pacis A. Pernet E. Ahmed E. Cardoso S. Nijnik A. et al.M. tuberculosis reprograms hematopoietic stem cells to limit myelopoiesis and impair trained immunity.Cell. 2020; 183: 752-770 e22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, we next determined whether the extensive pulmonary vascular damage facilitates the dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 to the BM. Indeed, while influenza viral RNA in the BM of IAV-infected mice was barely detectable (Figure 5A ), significant levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were detected in the BM of infected mice (Figures 5B–5C and S5A) as well as Roborovski (Figure 5D) and Syrian golden hamsters (Figure S5B). However, no differences in dissemination to the BM was observed between BCG-vaccinated and nonvaccinated animals (Figure S5B).

This indication is supported by a recent publication describing that SARS-CoV-2 infects and persists in the BM erythroid progenitors due to their expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors (Huerga Encabo et al., 2021Huerga Encabo H. Grey W. Garcia-Albornoz M. Wood H. Ulferts R. Aramburu I.V. Kulasekararaj A.G. Mufti G. Papayannopoulos V. Beale R. Bonnet D.

Considering that BCG reprograms both mouse and human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the BM to generate trained monocytes/macrophages (Kaufmann et al., 2018Kaufmann E. Sanz J. Dunn J.L. Khan N. Mendonca L.E. Pacis A. Tzelepis F. Pernet E. Dumaine A.

We infected blood monocytes from healthy volunteers before and 90 days after BCG vaccination with live IAV or SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 5E). At 24 h post infection, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and CCL2 expression was higher in response to IAV infection post BCG vaccination, while SARS-CoV-2 induced only minimal levels of cytokines either pre or post BCG vaccination (Figure 5F). Thus, BCG-trained monocytes mounted an efficient cytokine response to IAV infection, while this response was minimal during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central mechanisms involved in innate memory responses depend on epigenetic reprogramming that modifies the chromatin accessibility and thereby the readable gene information. In the context of LAVs, there are three known factors that can affect the epigenetic programming of an immune cell: (1) direct infection; (2) PAMPs from the microorganisms; and (3) endogenous cytokines released during the induction of the host response. The impact of these key factors occurs centrally, at the level of HSCs in the BM, and peripherally at the tissue-specific level. Recently, it has been demonstrated in pre-clinical (Kaufmann et al., 2018Kaufmann E. Sanz J. Dunn J.L. Khan N. Mendonca L.E. Pacis A. Tzelepis F. Pernet E. Dumaine A. Grenier J.C. et al.BCG educates hematopoietic stem cells to generate protective innate immunity against tuberculosis.Cell. 2018; 172 (e19): 176-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) and clinical (Cirovic et al., 2020Cirovic B. De Bree L.C.J. Groh L. Blok B.A. Chan J. Van Der Velden W. Bremmers M.E.J. Van Crevel R. Händler K. Picelli S. et al.BCG vaccination in humans elicits trained immunity via the hematopoietic progenitor compartment.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28 (e5): 322-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) studies that BCG reprograms BM-HSCs towards myelopoiesis to generate trained immunity, while the access of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis to the BM prevents trained immunity (Khan et al., 2020Khan N. Downey J. Sanz J. Kaufmann E. Blankenhaus B. Pacis A. Pernet E. Ahmed E. Cardoso S. Nijnik A. et al.M. tuberculosis reprograms hematopoietic stem cells to limit myelopoiesis and impair trained immunity.Cell. 2020; 183: 752-770 e22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These studies provide a logical explanation of why short-lived innate immune cells can acquire memory and how trained immunity induced by LAVs (e.g., BCG) can provide cross-protection against other infectious diseases. Here our data suggest that, compared with IAV infection, the unique pulmonary vascular damage induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection may allow for viral dissemination to the BM, effectively preventing the ability of BCG to generate trained immunity. Furthermore, our results from monocytes of BCG-vaccinated humans suggest that, in contrast to IAV infection, potential virulence factors from SARS-CoV-2 can substantially suppress the inflammatory programming of trained immune cells. Thus, identifying these virulence factors can lead us closer to uncovering how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks our immune responses. Our results contrast with a recent study demonstrating that BCG-i.v. vaccination increases survival of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice following SARS-CoV-2 challenge (Hilligan et al., 2022Hilligan K.L.

	abstract = {BackgroundAdenovirus-vectored (Ad-vectored) vaccines are typically administered via i.m. injection to humans and are incapable of inducing respiratory mucosal immunity. However, aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccines remains poorly characterized, and its ability to induce mucosal immunity in humans is unknown. This phase Ib trial evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of human serotype-5 Ad-vectored tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (AdHu5Ag85A) delivered to humans via inhaled aerosol or i.m. injection.MethodsThirty-one healthy, previously BCG-vaccinated adults were enrolled. AdHu5Ag85A was administered by single-dose aerosol using Aeroneb Solo Nebulizer or by i.m. injection. The study consisted of the low-dose (LD) aerosol, high-dose (HD) aerosol, and i.m. groups. The adverse events were assessed at various times after vaccination. Immunogenicity data were collected from the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples at baseline, as well as at select time points after vaccination.ResultsThe nebulized aerosol droplets were < 5.39 μm in size. Both LD and HD of AdHu5Ag85A administered by aerosol inhalation and i.m. injection were safe and well tolerated. Both aerosol doses, particularly LD, but not i.m., vaccination markedly induced airway tissue-resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of polyfunctionality. While as expected, i.m. vaccination induced Ag85A-specific T cell responses in the blood, the LD aerosol vaccination also elicited such T cells in the blood. Furthermore, the LD aerosol vaccination induced persisting transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages.ConclusionInhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccine is a safe and superior way to elicit respiratory mucosal immunity.

	abstract = {Since December 2019, there has been an outbreak of a novel beta-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with over 118,000 cases in more than 110 countries around the world. In response to the global Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency, clinical trial research assessing the efficacy and safety of experimental vaccines to prevent COVID-19 are emerging at an unprecedented rate. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the preliminary experiences and ongoing clinical trials of the major candidates and challenges of the vaccine strategies in humans.After a-priori protocol registration with PROSPERO (181483), systematic research of the published literature was conducted on April 24, 2020, using Medline (via PubMed), Embase (via Ovid), and WHO databases. Moreover, to explore the more recent literature we also searched the preprint server medRxiv. Finally, we scrutinized the Cochrane COVID-19 study register and the COVID-19 section of ClinicalTrials.gov database to identify relevant ongoing clinical trials. Thereafter we selected the articles according to the PRISMA Guidelines. Animal or in-vitro experimental studies were excluded. Moreover editorials, commentaries, abstracts, reviews, book chapters, and articles not in English were not included.Our search identified 1359 published papers, 478 preprint articles and 367 ongoing clinical trials. Finally, only ten ongoing clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. Specifically, seven developed vaccines for the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and three clinical trials assessed the protective role of BCG vaccine against COVID-19. The first group included phase I/II trials with different types of molecules (DNA or mRNA vaccine, bacterial plasmid or viral vectors), the latter were phase III/IV trials designed on the basis of a heterologous lymphocyte activation by the BCG vaccine.This new disease is pushing the scientific community to develop swiftly a safe and effective vaccine. Notwithstanding the limitations of our analysis, given by the absence of available results, we try to provide a comprehensive view of the ongoing clinical trials in humans. Our analysis reveals a worldwide effort of both scientists and enterprises to achieve one of the most challenging goals of our century.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis vaccines (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, BCG) were introduced 100 years ago and are still recommended by the World Health Organization to prevent the disease. Studies have shown that BCG vaccination can stimulate non-specific immune responses and reduce the incidence of certain diseases. At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it was hypothesised that the incidence of COVID-19 was lower in countries with BCG prevention. In an attempt to verify this thesis, we conducted a multicenter, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on a group of 695 health care workers aged 25 years and over in Poland. All participants in the study had a tuberculin test, after which those who were negative were randomised (1:1) and received either the BCG- or placebo vaccine. From then on, these people were subjected to three months of observation for the occurrence of COVID-19 symptoms. The statistical analysis did not reveal any significant correlation between the frequency of incidents suspected of COVID-19 and BCG-10 vaccination, the result of the tuberculin test and the number of scars. The only statistically significant feature was the type of medical profession-nurses became infected more often than doctors or other medical workers (p = 0.02). The results differ from similar trials in other countries. Perhaps this is due to the lack of an unvaccinated control group. The impact of BCG vaccination on the course of COVID-19 requires further research.},

	abstract = {The Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which is widely used to protect children against tuberculosis, can also improve immune response against viral infections. This unicentric, randomized-controlled clinical trial assessed the efficacy and safety of revaccination with BCG Moscow in reducing the positivity and symptoms of COVID-19 in health care workers (HCWs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs who had negative COVID-19 IgM and IgG and who dedicated at least eight hours per week in facilities that attended to individuals suspected of having COVID-19 were included in the study and were followed for 7, 15, 30, 60, and 180 days by telemedicine. The HCWs were randomly allocated to a revaccinated with BCG group, which received the BCG vaccine, or an unvaccinated group. Revaccination with BCG Moscow was found to be safe, and its efficacy ranged from 30.0% (95.0%CI -78.0 to 72.0%) to 31.0% (95.0%CI -74.0 to 74.0%). Mycobacterium bovis BCG Moscow did not induce NK cell activation at 15-20 days post-revaccination. As hypothesized, revaccination with BCG Moscow was associated with a lower incidence of COVID-19 positivity, though the results did not reach statistical significance. Further studies should be carried out to assess whether revaccination with BCG is able to protect HCWs against COVID-19. The protocol of this clinical trial was registered on August 5th, 2020, at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos, RBR-4kjqtg - ensaiosclinicos.gov.br/rg/RBR-4kjqtg/1) and the WHO (# U1111-1256-3892). The clinical trial protocol was approved by the Comissão Nacional de ética de pesquisa- CONEP (CAAE 31783720.0.0000.5078).},

Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global health crisis that requires a comprehensive understanding of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to develop effective therapeutics. One potential strategy to instill greater immune protection against COVID-19 is boosting the innate immune system. This boosting, termed trained immunity, employs immune system modulators to train innate immune cells to produce an enhanced, non-specific immune response upon reactivation following exposure to pathogens, a process that has been studied in the context of in vitro and in vivo clinical studies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluation of the underlying pathways that are essential to inducing protective trained immunity will provide insight into identifying potential therapeutic targets that may alleviate the COVID-19 crisis. Here we review multiple immune training agents, including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), β-glucan, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the two most popular cell types involved in trained immunity, monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells, and compare the signaling pathways involved in innate immunity. Additionally, we discuss COVID-19 trained immunity clinical trials, emphasizing the potential of trained immunity to fight SARS-CoV-2 infection. Understanding the mechanisms by which training agents activate innate immune cells to reprogram immune responses may prove beneficial in developing preventive and therapeutic targets against COVID-19.},

In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 2/3 trial, we evaluate the safety and efficacy of a multi-dose Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19 and other infectious disease in a COVID-19-unvaccinated, at-risk-community-based cohort. The at-risk population is made of up of adults with type 1 diabetes. We enrolled 144 subjects and randomized 96 to BCG and 48 to placebo. There were no dropouts over the 15-month trial. A cumulative incidence of 12.5% of placebo-treated and 1% of BCG-treated participants meets criteria for confirmed COVID-19, yielding an efficacy of 92%. The BCG group also displayed fewer infectious disease symptoms and lesser severity and fewer infectious disease events per patient, including COVID-19. There were no BCG-related systemic adverse events. BCG's broad-based infection protection suggests that it may provide platform protection against new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants and other pathogens.},

We assessed the safety and antitumor activity of intravesical pembrolizumab combined with BCG. A 3 + 3 phase 1 trial of pembrolizumab + BCG was conducted in patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC (NCT02808143). Pembrolizumab was given intravesically (1–5 mg/kg for 2 h) beginning 2 weeks prior to BCG induction until recurrence. Urine profiling during treatment and spatial transcriptomic profiling of pre- and post-treatment tumors were conducted to identify biomarkers that correlated with response. Safety and tolerability of immune checkpoint inhibition were assessed, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Nine patients completed therapy. Median follow-up was 35 months for five patients still alive at the end of the trial. The trial was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Grade 1–2 urinary symptoms were common. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached; however, one dose-limiting toxicity was reported (grade 2 diarrhea) in the only patient who reached 52 weeks without recurrence. One death occurred from myasthenia gravis that was deemed potentially related to treatment. The 6-mo and 1-yr recurrence-free rates were 67% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42–100%) and 22% (95% CI: 6.5–75%), respectively. Pembrolizumab was detected in the urine and not in blood. CD4+ T cells were significantly increased in the urine after treatment, and a transcriptomic analysis identified decreased expression of T-cell exhaustion markers in late recurrences. We demonstrate that intravesical pembrolizumab is safe, feasible, and capable of eliciting strong immune responses in a clinical setting and should be investigated further. Direct application of pembrolizumab to the bladder is a promising alternative for non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and should be investigated further.},

But given the dramatic progress in developing vaccines to protect us against SARS-CoV-2, with new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines licensed within 12 months of the genome of the virus being sequenced, the question is why progress developing a more effective tuberculosis vaccine has been so slow? And what is now required to accelerate the introduction of new, more effective vaccines for tuberculosis? We now know how quickly airborne pathogens can spread worldwide, and although most tuberculosis patients can be successfully treated, albeit with a long course of antibiotics, we still have the spectre of increasing numbers of multi and extensively drug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, that are resistant to most if not all of our available antibiotics.13Migliori GB Tiberi S Zumla A et al.MDR/XDR-TB management of patients and contacts: challenges facing the new decade.

Even compared to the COVID pandemic, the numbers dying from tuberculosis make sobering reading.14WHO Global TB Report 2021. https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2021. Accessed 20 January 2022.Google Scholar By mid-January 2022, there had been over 5.5 million deaths from COVID, but there are ∼1.4M deaths from tuberculosis each year – which had until the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 been the leading infectious killer. And this is before the deterioration in tuberculosis control programmes because of the COVID pandemic are taken into account –estimates are that COVID itself could lead to a 36% increase in deaths from tuberculosis over the next 5 years.15Hogan AB Jewell BL Sherrard-Smith E et al.Potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries: a modelling study.Lancet Glob Health. 2020; 8: e1132-e1141Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar So why it is taking so long to make a vaccine that is better than the 100-year-old BCG vaccine? A number of M. tuberculosis animal challenge models have been developed to expedite vaccine development. Candidate vaccines are usually first evaluated in mouse models, which are often criticised as not being fully representative of the pathology of human disease. Guinea pigs are considered a better model and are more sensitive to M. tuberculosis infection, but their use is limited by a lack of immunological reagents. BCG vaccination is highly effective in both mice and guinea pigs and is used as a gold standard positive control in challenge studies. Candidate vaccines have to be at least as good as BCG, and usually better, to progress. There are new murine models that better represent human pathology16Basaraba RJ Hunter RL. Pathology of tuberculosis: how the pathology of human tuberculosis informs and directs animal models.Microbiol Spectr. 2017; 5 (10.1128)Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar and ultra-low dose infection models look promising17Plumlee CR Duffy FJ Gern BH et al.Ultra-low dose aerosol infection of mice with mycobacterium tuberculosis more closely models human tuberculosis.Cell Host Microbe. 2021; 29: 68-82Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar but non-human primates (NHP) are undoubtedly the best model18Cardona PJ Williams A. Experimental animal modelling for TB vaccine development.Int J Infect Dis. 2017; 56: 268-273Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar even if the cost of experiments and restrictions on their use limits their availability. The lack of good small animal models, and the costs of using non-human primates has undoubtedly slowed successful vaccine development, as has uncertainty as to which animal model, if any, best represents the human situation. A further challenge to establishing representative animal models for tuberculosis vaccine development is that exposure to, and co-infection with, other pathogens may alter both susceptibility to M. tuberculosis and BCG vaccine efficacy, in humans. Exposure to non-tuberculous mycobacteria is the most likely explanation for the varying immunogenicity of BCG closer to the equator,19Black GF Weir RE Floyd S et al.BCG-induced increase in interferon-gamma response to mycobacterial antigens and efficacy of BCG vaccination in Malawi and the UK: two randomised controlled studies.Lancet. 2002; 359: 1393-1401Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar co-infection with HIV increases susceptibility to tuberculosis even in the presence of anti-retroviral therapy,20Cohen K Meintjes G.

Non-tuberculous mycobacteria have diverse effects on BCG efficacy against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2014; 94: 226-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar Another common reason given for the slow progress in tuberculosis vaccine R\&D is the slow growth of mycobacteria. Whereas many extracellular bacteria can divide every 20 minutes, the intracellular mycobacteria are slow growing. This means it takes mycobacteria about 24 hours or longer to divide, and so tuberculosis develops slowly. Animal models of tuberculosis are time-consuming, with timelines of 3-6 months for many experiments. What such protracted experimental work needs is longer term funding, and here the slow growing mycobacteria can contribute to a lack of rapid progress. Even clinical efficacy trials require a timescale of at least 3 years if progression to disease (POD) is the primary endpoint. Despite these problems, as noted above there has been recent progress with a number of vaccine candidates of different types reaching phase 2 /3 trials, and more at earlier stages of development6TB vaccine pipeline, 2021. https://www.tbvi.eu/what-we-do/pipeline-of-vaccines. Accessed 20 January 2022.Google Scholar (Figure 1). If COVID vaccines can be developed so quickly, why are new tuberculosis vaccines different? Here there are a number of important factors (Table 1), although they are not insurmountable. Firstly, despite tuberculosis being declared a global emergency by the World Health Organisation in 1994, tuberculosis research has lacked the urgency that the COVID pandemic brought about. The situation with tuberculosis has been so bad for so long, that either people think that tuberculosis is a historic disease that no longer poses a threat to human health - or being a chronic problem with higher endemicity in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC), there has been no sense of urgency in terms of funding priorities. Funding is limited and there has been no sense of a crisis, or that we might only have 1-2 years to deliver an effective vaccine, as there was with SARS-CoV-2.Table 1Comparison of key issues for development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.SARS-CoV-2TuberculosisNotesKey protective antigenSpike proteinNumber of key specific and cross-reactive antigens identifiedM. tuberculosis genome encodes ∼4000 genesAntigenic variationMutations commonAntigenic variation limitedBoth SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis show strain variation in transmissibilityImmune correlates of protectionNeutralising antibodies considered key although T cells likely to play a roleCell-mediated immunity critical although precise definition unclear.

Open table in a new tab Secondly, there are critical differences between a virus such as SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 has a 29.9kB genome with 12 expressed genes, open reading frames encoding ∼30,000 nucleotides and with a single Spike protein that is required for cell invasion.23Wu A Peng Y Huang B et al.Genome composition and divergence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) originating in China.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 27: 325-328Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar M. tuberculosis has a genome with ∼4.4 million base pairs encoding ∼3906 protein genes,24Cole ST Brosch R Parkhill J et al.Deciphering the biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from the complete genome sequence.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6406) Google Scholar and although a number of proteins play a role in its pathogenicity, there is no consensus on the best single antigen or even antigens that would be most protective in a vaccine. The tuberculosis vaccines currently in the development pipeline use both M. tuberculosis specific or cross-reactive antigens shared with other mycobacteria. Some candidate vaccines have aimed to improve the existing BCG vaccine (or vaccines as there are a number of BCG vaccine strains in current use, which differ in the genes and antigens they express). However, M. tuberculosis does have a major advantage for vaccine developers in that although the M. tuberculosis strains in circulation and causing human tuberculosis vary genetically, there is very limited evidence of antigenic variation, and moreover some evidence that it is the human T cell epitopes that are most highly conserved.25Comas I Chakravartti J Small PM et al.Human T cell epitopes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are evolutionarily hyperconserved.Nat Genet. 2010; 42: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar This means that there is no issue with immune evasion resulting from mutations, as seen with SARS-CoV-2. Differences in the clinical course of infection also help explain why progress with tuberculosis vaccine research and development is slower than for SARS-CoV-2. The natural history of infection with M. tuberculosis is complex. Most people who are infected with M. tuberculosis do not develop primary disease but mount a sufficient immune response to control, but not eradicate infection, called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).26Barry 3rd, CE Boshoff HI Dartois V et al.The spectrum of latent tuberculosis: rethinking the biology and intervention strategies.Nat Rev Microbiol. 2009; 7: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar,27Esmail H Barry 3rd, CE Young DB Wilkinson RJ The ongoing challenge of latent tuberculosis.Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2014; 36920130437Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar When host immunity breaks down, because of co-infection with HIV, treatment with biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies against Th1 cytokines such as TNFa28Keane J Gershon S Wise RP et al.Tuberculosis associated with infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor alpha-neutralizing agent.N Engl J Med. 2001; 345: 1098-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar or simply when immune senescence occurs with aging, this latent infection can reactivate and cause disease. We now consider there is a continuous spectrum of tuberculosis, rather than discrete binary outcomes of infection or disease, and new intermediate states of incipient (without detectable live mycobacteria) and subclinical disease in which asymptomatic transmission may occur, as well as “resistors” who may clear infections without induction of a persistent detectable immune response have been proposed.29Drain PK Bajema KL Dowdy D et al.Incipient and subclinical tuberculosis: a clinical review of early stages and progression of infection.Clin Microbiol Rev. 2018; 31 (-e00018): e00021Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar,30Simmons JD Stein CM Seshadri C et al.Immunological mechanisms of human resistance to persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Nat Rev Immunol. 2018; 18: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar It is clear that the outcome of M. tuberculosis infection is a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host immune response. For SARS-CoV-2, as with other Corona viruses, there is no latent and reactivation stage. The incubation period is relatively short. Not everyone develops disease, and asymptomatic transmission can occur.31Rothe C Schunk M Sothmann P et al.Transmission of 2019-nCoV infection from an asymptomatic contact in Germany.N Engl J Med. 2020; 382: 970-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (2365) Google Scholar Another challenge for tuberculosis vaccine design is that M. tuberculosis remains latent in many people in part because of an ability to evade and subvert the host immune response, and this complicates vaccine design.32Ernst JD. Mechanisms of M. tuberculosis immune evasion as challenges to TB vaccine design.Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24: 34-42Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar From delaying phagolysosomal fusion and preventing acidification of the vacuole, through to downregulating Class II MHC presentation on antigen presenting cells, there are a variety of mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis can persist in the human host. Whilst some of the long-term sequelae and serious disease caused by SARS–CoV-2 may be in part mediated by the host immune response, there is no evidence of immune evasion caused by the virus manipulating its intracellular milieu, although mutant strains can escape pre-existing immunity. The ability to suppress the development of protective immune responses is one of the reasons why M. tuberculosis has been such a successful pathogen over centuries. Controlled human infection models, whereby small numbers of healthy volunteers are deliberately exposed to the pathogen in question, have been used very successfully for other globally important but complex pathogens such as Plasmodium falciparum.33Ewer KJ O'Hara GA Duncan CJ et al.Protective CD8+ T-cell immunity to human malaria induced by chimpanzee adenovirus-MVA immunisation.Nat Commun. 2013; 4: 2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar Malaria human challenge models have expedited both vaccine development and the identification of immune correlates of protection. Developing a controlled human infection model for tuberculosis raises issues including which pathogen to use, whether it is acceptable to deliberately infect with a fully virulent strain, and which route of infection to use in such models.34McShane H.

Not only has it been clear that the Spike protein would be an obvious target, but the ability to measure antibody concentrations to the Spike protein provides a straightforward correlate of protection,37McMahan K Yu J Mercado NB et al.Correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in rhesus macaques.Nature. 2021; 590: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar even though there is evidence that T cell-mediated protection may also be important.38Peng Y Mentzer AJ Liu G et al.Broad and strong memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced by SARS-CoV-2 in UK convalescent individuals following COVID-19.Nat Immunol. 2020; 21: 1336-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar This is something the tuberculosis community has struggled with over decades, despite the involvement of many leading immunologists worldwide. Being an intracellular pathogen, the assumption has always been that T cell immunity to M. tuberculosis, and likely a Th1 T cell response was the key to protection.

All 4 UK-licensed vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have demonstrated high levels of efficacy in phase III studies, less than one year after first being tested in human clinical trials. Although this success was only possible because of significant prior investment in R\&D into the platform technologies for adenovirus vectored vaccines and mRNA vaccines, it remains the case that to develop new vaccines against COVID disease so quickly was extraordinary. In contrast, the most promising candidate tuberculosis vaccine, M72, a fusion protein of two M. tuberculosis antigens administered together with a potent adjuvant, AS01, was first tested in clinical trials in 200443Von Eschen K Morrison R Braun M et al.The candidate tuberculosis vaccine Mtb72F/AS02A: tolerability and immunogenicity in humans.Hum Vaccin. 2009; 5: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; it took until 2019 for the final results of a phase IIb trial which showed this vaccine provided 50% protection against tuberculosis disease in young, M. tuberculosis latently infected adults.44Tait DR Hatherill M Van Der Meeren O et al.Final analysis of a trial of M72/AS01E vaccine to prevent tuberculosis.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: 2429-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar This result needs confirming in a larger phase III trial which has yet to start, despite the phase IIb trial reporting in 2019. Key questions remain about this vaccine candidate including whether it would also confer protection in those with prior BCG but uninfected with M. tuberculosis. Ideally, we would have a tuberculosis vaccine that demonstrated the kinds of levels of efficacy seen with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Progress with complex pathogens such as M. tuberculosis is slower and more iterative than vaccines for respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, but can be accelerated; for example, the mRNA technologies that have proved so effective for SARS-CoV-2 are now being applied to M. tuberculosis, and would make it possible for new vaccines to be produced in Africa. It is worth noting here that the first report of a RNA vaccine for tuberculosis was published in 2004.45Xue T Stavropoulos E Yang M et al.RNA encoding the MPT83 antigen induces protective immune responses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Infect Immun. 2004; 72 (doi: 10.1128/IAI.72.11.6324-6329.2004): 6324-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar Innovation in clinical trial design has also led to improvements in our understanding in tuberculosis vaccine development. Phase IIb clinical trials where the primary endpoint is clinical disease require extended periods of follow up and large numbers of subjects. Unlike malaria, where incidence of infection can be as high as 60% in a malaria season, incidence of tuberculosis disease in even the highest burden settings is often only 1-2%. Using Prevention of Infection (POI), rather than Prevention of Disease (POD) as an endpoint means smaller trials with shorter periods of follow up are possible,46Hawn TR Day TA Scriba TJ et al.Tuberculosis vaccines and prevention of infection.Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2014; 78: 650-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar but requires vaccination pre-exposure, either in neonates or in adolescents who are pre-screened for infection. The first reported POI trial demonstrated that BCG revaccination conferred 45% protection against sustained infection, as measured by sustained Quantiferon conversion.47Nemes E Geldenhuys H Rozot V et al.Prevention of M. tuberculosis infection with H4:IC31 vaccine or BCG revaccination.N Engl J Med. 2018; 379: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar Whilst there are caveats with this approach including the fact that the definition of infection is indirect, and the relationship between POI and POD is unclear, as a way to demonstrate a biological signal of efficacy in the target species, humans, such an approach has merit.

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which broke out at the end of 2019, is a global pandemic and seriously threatens human health. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent and control COVID-19. At present, more than 13 COVID-19 vaccines have been urgently authorized for use, but the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants has brought unprecedented challenges to the protective efficiency of these COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, the recent emergence of Delta and Omicron variants, which are rapidly spreading worldwide, may bring many challenges to the medical systems. Interestingly, previous studies have shown that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine used to prevent tuberculosis can induce non-specific trained immunity, protecting against infectious diseases caused by respiratory viruses. Therefore, there is a hypothesis that BCG plays an essential role in reducing the incidence, severity, hospitalization, and mortality of COVID-19 and enhancing the protection efficiency of the COVID-19 vaccine. To confirm this hypothesis, 56 clinical trials have been conducted globally to assess BCG's protective effectiveness against COVID-19 infection. Herein, this review discussed the trained immunity induced by BCG and its underlying mechanisms and summarised BCG's latest research progress in preventing COVID-19, especially the ongoing clinical trials. We hope this review will provide new strategies for fighting against COVID-19.},

This study evaluated BCG vaccine cross-protection in adults with convalescent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Method This was a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase III study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04369794). Setting: University Community Health Center and Municipal Outpatient Center in South America. Patients: a total of 378 adult patients with convalescent COVID-19 were included. Intervention: single intradermal BCG vaccine (n = 183) and placebo (n = 195). Measurements: the primary outcome was clinical evolution. Other outcomes included adverse events and humoral immune responses for up to 6 months. Results A significantly higher proportion of BCG patients with anosmia and ageusia recovered at the 6-week follow-up visit than placebo (anosmia: 83.1% vs. 68.7% healed, p = 0.043, number needed to treat [NNT] = 6.9; ageusia: 81.2% vs. 63.4% healed, p = 0.032, NNT = 5.6). BCG also prevented the appearance of ageusia in the following weeks: seven in 113 (6.2%) BCG recipients versus 19 in 126 (15.1%) placebos, p = 0.036, NNT = 11.2. BCG did not induce any severe or systemic adverse effects. The most common and expected adverse effects were local vaccine lesions, erythema (n = 152; 86.4%), and papules (n = 111; 63.1%). Anti–severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 humoral response measured by N protein immunoglobulin G titer and seroneutralization by interacting with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor suggest that the serum of BCG-injected patients may neutralize the virus at lower specificity; however, the results were not statistically significant. Conclusion BCG vaccine is safe and offers cross-protection against COVID-19 with potential humoral response modulation. Limitations: No severely ill patients were included.},

Although more than ten COVID-19 specific vaccines have been approved for emergency use, COVID-19 prevention and control still face many challenges. Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is the only authorized vaccine used to fight against tuberculosis (TB), it has been hypothesized that BCG may prevent and control COVID-19 based on BCG-induced nonspecific immune responses. Herein, we summarized: 1) The nonspecific protection effects of BCG, such as prophylactic protection effects of BCG on nonmycobacterial infections, immunotherapy effects of BCG vaccine, and enhancement effect of BCG vaccine on unrelated vaccines; 2) Recent evidence of BCG's efficacy against SARS-COV-2 infection from ecological studies, analytical analyses, clinical trials, and animal studies; 3) Three possible mechanisms of BCG vaccine and their effects on COVID-19 control including heterologous immunity, trained immunity, and anti-inflammatory effect. We hope that this review will encourage more scientists to investigate further BCG induced non-specific immune responses and explore their mechanisms, which could be a potential tool for addressing the COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19-like “Black Swan” events to reduce the impacts of infectious disease outbreaks on public health, politics, and economy.},

	abstract = {Universal coverage of vaccines alone cannot be relied upon to protect at-risk populations in lower- and middle-income countries against the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and newer variants. Live vaccines, including Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), are being studied for their effectiveness in reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infection.In this multi-centre quadruple-blind, parallel assignment randomised control trial, 495 high-risk group adults (aged 18-60 years) were randomised into BCG and placebo arms and followed up for 9 months from the date of vaccination. The primary outcome was the difference in the incidence of COVID-19 infection at the end of 9 months. Secondary outcomes included the difference in the incidence of severe COVID-19 infections, hospitalisation rates, intensive care unit stay, oxygen requirement and mortality at the end of 9 months. The primary analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis, while safety analysis was done per protocol.There was no significant difference in the incidence rates of cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CB-NAAT) positive COVID-19 infection [odds ratio (OR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-2.14] in the two groups, but the BCG arm showed a statistically significant decrease in clinically diagnosed (symptomatic) probable COVID-19 infections (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.72). Compared with the BCG arm, significantly more patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia (CB-NAAT positive) and required hospitalisation and oxygen in the placebo arm (six versus none; p = 0.03). One patient belonging to the placebo arm required intensive care unit (ICU) stay and died. BCG had a protective efficacy of 62% (95% CI 28-80%) for likely symptomatic COVID-19 infection.BCG is protective in reducing the incidence of acute respiratory illness (probable symptomatic COVID-19 infection) and severity of the disease, including hospitalisation, in patients belonging to the high-risk group of COVID-19 infection, and the antibody response persists for quite a long time. A multi-centre study with a larger sample size will help to confirm the findings in this study.Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI/2020/07/026668).The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been studied previously in several settings, including reducing childhood mortalities due to viral infections and induction of trained immunity and reducing upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia in older adults. This multi-centre trial has tried to evaluate the efficacy of BCG revaccination in reducing the incidence and severity of COVID-19 infections in adults between 18 and 60 years of age belonging to the high-risk group owing to the presence of comorbidities including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease and chronic lung diseases. A single dose of BCG vaccine produced significantly high titres of BCG antibodies lasting for six months. While there was no significant reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 infection, there was an 8.4% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 disease at the end of 9 months of follow-up. In addition, there were significantly fewer severe COVID-19 infections requiring hospital stay and oxygen support. However, the overall numbers of severe COVID-19 infections were low. Thus, the study shows that BCG can protect against symptomatic and severe COVID-19 disease. However, it might not reduce the incidence of new infections. The study results are significant for low- and middle-income countries without adequate coverage of primary doses of COVID-19 vaccination, let alone the booster doses. Future studies should evaluate the BCG vaccine’s efficacy as a booster compared with routine COVID-19 vaccine boosters.},

	abstract = {Although not being the first viral pandemic to affect humankind, we are now for the first time faced with a pandemic caused by a coronavirus. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide. Despite unprecedented efforts, with vaccines being developed in a record time, SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread worldwide with new variants arising in different countries. Such persistent spread is in part enabled by public resistance to vaccination in some countries, and limited access to vaccines in other countries. The limited vaccination coverage, the continued risk for resistant variants, and the existence of natural reservoirs for coronaviruses, highlight the importance of developing additional therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. At the beginning of the pandemic it was suggested that countries with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programs could be associated with a reduced number and/or severity of COVID-19 cases. Preliminary studies have provided evidence for this relationship and further investigation is being conducted in ongoing clinical trials. The protection against SARS-CoV-2 induced by BCG vaccination may be mediated by cross-reactive T cell lymphocytes, which recognize peptides displayed by class I Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA-I) on the surface of infected cells. In order to identify potential targets of T cell cross-reactivity, we implemented an in silico strategy combining sequence-based and structure-based methods to screen over 13,5 million possible cross-reactive peptide pairs from BCG and SARS-CoV-2. Our study produced (i) a list of immunogenic BCG-derived peptides that may prime T cell cross-reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, (ii) a large dataset of modeled peptide-HLA structures for the screened targets, and (iii) new computational methods for structure-based screenings that can be used by others in future studies. Our study expands the list of BCG peptides potentially involved in T cell cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides, and identifies multiple high-density "neighborhoods" of cross-reactive peptides which could be driving heterologous immunity induced by BCG vaccination, therefore providing insights for future vaccine development efforts.},

IntroductionInfectious diseases are the leading cause of early life mortality worldwide, with ∼2.5 million newborns and infants dying from infections each year. Approximately 45% of deaths in children under five occurred during the neonatal period, defined as the first 28 days of life (World Health Organization, 2020World Health OrganizationChildren: Improving Survival and Well-Being. World Health Organization, 2020Google Scholar). Immunization is a cost-effective public health intervention that reduces the risk of morbidity and averts ∼2 to 3 million deaths every year. Protective responses to immunization in early life are different from those in older individuals, partly due to newborns and young infants’ distinct immune systems (Dowling and Levy, 2014Dowling D.J. Levy O. Ontogeny of early life immunity.Trends Immunol. 2014; 35: 299-310https://doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2014.04.007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar; Sanchez-Schmitz and Levy, 2011Sanchez-Schmitz G.

Characterizing sex-, age-, and antigen-specific responses is key to developing vaccines tailored for vulnerable populations, such as the very young (Whittaker et al., 2018Whittaker E. Goldblatt D. McIntyre P. Levy O. Neonatal immunization: rationale, current state, and future Prospects.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 532https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.00532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Immunization at birth with live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis vaccines, referred to as bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), is recommended in countries with endemic tuberculosis (TB) to protect infants against miliary TB and tuberculous meningitis (Mangtani et al., 2014Mangtani P. Abubakar I. Ariti C. Beynon R. Pimpin L. Fine P.E.M. Rodrigues L.C. Smith P.G. Lipman M. Whiting P.F. et al.Protection by BCG vaccine against tuberculosis: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.Clin Infect Dis. 2014; 58: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Although there are no definite correlates of protection, some studies have linked BCG efficacy against TB to its ability to effectively induce T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-polarized neonatal immune responses (Libraty et al., 2014Libraty D.H. Zhang L. Woda M. Acosta L.P. Obcena A. Brion J.D. Capeding R.Z. Neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with enhanced T-helper 1 immune responses to heterologous infant vaccines.Trials Vaccinol. 2014; 3: 1-5https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trivac.2013.11.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Marchant et al., 1999Marchant A. Goetghebuer T. Ota M.O. Wolfe I. Ceesay S.J. De Groote D. Corrah T. Bennett S. Wheeler J. Huygen K. et al.Newborns develop a Th1-type immune response to Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination.J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2249-2255PubMed Google Scholar). Across multiple studies, the administration of BCG in early life has been associated with a reduced incidence of unrelated (“off-target”) infections. Such beneficial pathogen-agnostic (“heterologous”) effects of BCG are hypothesized to reduce morbidity and mortality far beyond what is expected from prevention of the target disease—i.e., TB (Higgins et al., 2016Higgins J.P.T. Soares-Weiser K. Lopez-Lopez J.A. Kakourou A. Chaplin K. Christensen H. Martin N.K. Sterne J.A.C. Reingold A.L.

For example, three consecutive randomized trials demonstrated that early administration of BCG to low-birthweight newborns in Guinea-Bissau significantly reduced mortality by ∼38% (17%–54%) (Biering-Sorensen et al., 2017Biering-Sorensen S. Aaby P. Lund N. Monteiro I. Jensen K.J. Eriksen H.B. Schaltz-Buchholzer F. Jorgensen A.S.P. Rodrigues A. Fisker A.B. Benn C.S.

The rapid beneficial effects of BCG in early life suggest that it may be mediated via innate immunity. The mechanisms mediating BCG protection are under active investigation (Curtis et al., 2020Curtis N. Sparrow A. Ghebreyesus T.A. Netea M.G. Considering BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1545-1546https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)31025-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar; Moorlag et al., 2019Moorlag S.

Med. 2020; 12: eaax4517https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aax4517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).One potential mechanism for the heterologous effects of BCG is epigenetic reprogramming of human innate immune cells, i.e., trained immunity, resulting in altered innate immune responses upon rechallenge with heterologous stimuli in adults (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J. Quintin J. Preijers F. Joosten L.A.B. Ifrim D.C. Saeed S. Jacobs C. van Loenhout J. de Jong D. Stunnenberg H.G. et al.Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Systemic metabolic pathways have been implicated in the immune system regulation (Boothby and Rickert, 2017Boothby M. Rickert R.C. Metabolic regulation of the immune humoral response.Immunity. 2017; 46: 743-755https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2017.04.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). A potential role for metabolism in the protective effects of BCG has been posited (Kelly and O'Neill, 2015Kelly B. O'Neill L.A. Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells in innate immunity.Cell Res. 2015; 25: 771-784https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.68Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Training effects may be mediated by metabolites functioning as cofactors for epigenetic enzymes to induce chromatin and DNA modifications; upon rechallenge with a second stimulus that is unrelated to the first stimulus that induces training, trained cells can mount a more rapid and effective immune response (Netea et al., 2016Netea M.G.

Changes in glucose, glutamine, and cholesterol metabolism maintain trained immunity by providing active intermediate metabolites (Fok et al., 2019Fok E.T. Davignon L. Fanucchi S. Mhlanga M.M. The lncRNA connection between cellular metabolism and epigenetics in trained immunity.Front. Immunol. 2019; 9: 3184https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2018.03184Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Vaccine-induced metabolic changes that contribute to trained immunity have been studied in adults. Still, the impact of the BCG vaccine on human neonatal metabolism has yet to be characterized (Kollmann, 2013Kollmann T.R.

Given newborns’ unique developmental physiology and nutritional/metabolic needs compared with adults, vaccine-induced metabolic changes may be age dependent (Angelidou et al., 2021Angelidou A.

Metabolomics has been used to identify active or dysregulated pathways (Guijas et al., 2018Guijas C. Montenegro-Burke J.R. Warth B. Spilker M.E. Siuzdak G.

Circulating metabolites can have immunomodulatory effects, and, conversely, immune activation can shape the plasma metabolome and predict future disease phenotypes (Diray-Arce et al., 2020Diray-Arce J.

While several metabolites in neonatal monocytes and macrophages, such as acetyl-coenzyme A and succinate, play a role in the induction of epigenetic modulators, essential to trained immunity, much remains to be learned regarding the distinct neonatal immunometabolism (Arts et al., 2018Arts R.J.W.

However, to date, no published systems vaccinology studies have assessed systemic metabolic responses of newborns to immunization.This study examined the effects of neonatal BCG vaccination on the global metabolic profile in newborn blood plasma at four weeks of life. Subsequently, we investigated how BCG vaccination impacts the plasma lipidome and both antigen-specific and innate cytokine induction. We report that BCG vaccination induces metabolic shifts in vivo and in vitro, particularly in lysolipid pathways, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) that correlate with Toll-like receptor (TLR)-agonist- and purified protein derivative (PPD, mycobacterial antigen)-induced whole-blood cytokine responses. Our observations provide fresh insights into BCG’s potential mechanisms of action, identify new candidate pathways and biomarkers that may inform optimization of its beneficial effects, and suggest that vaccine-induced metabolites are relevant to vaccine immunogenicity.ResultsBCG vaccination-induced shifts in the infant plasma metabolomeTo elucidate the impact of early BCG vaccination, plasma samples from in vivo and in vitro cohorts were subjected to comprehensive metabolomics analysis. Our primary in vivo cohort consisted of low-birthweight newborns from Guinea-Bissau who were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial to receive BCG at birth (classified as early BCG) or at six weeks after birth (delayed BCG) (Biering-Sorensen et al., 2017Biering-Sorensen S.

Dis. 2017; 65: 1183-1190https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/cix525Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In an immunological study nested within the trial, capillary blood samples were collected four weeks after randomization (after BCG was given in the early BCG group and before BCG was given in the delayed BCG group) to investigate the effect of BCG on PPD-antigen- and TLR-agonist-induced whole-blood cytokine responses in vitro (Figure 1A ) (Jensen et al., 2015Jensen K.J. Larsen N. Biering-Sorensen S. Andersen A. Eriksen H.B. Monteiro I. Hougaard D. Aaby P. Netea M.G. Flanagan K.L. Benn C.S.

Catch-up vaccination followed at six weeks of life with pentavalent vaccine (Penta) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) for the early BCG group and BCG, Penta, and OPV for the delayed BCG group (Figure 2A ).Figure 2BCG immunization perturbed the human neonatal plasma metabolomeShow full caption(A) Schematic layout of blood collection for the in vivo Guinea-Bissau newborn cohort.

Larsen N. Biering-Sorensen S. Andersen A. Eriksen H.B. Monteiro I. Hougaard D. Aaby P. Netea M.G. Flanagan K.L. Benn C.S.

Dis. 2015; 211: 956-967https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu508Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), blood samples with the remaining plasma of sufficient volume were shipped to the Precision Vaccines Program (Boston, MA, USA) for subsequent assays. Study design, including the enrollment and randomization procedures and sample processing of the immunological substudy, is outlined in Figures S1A–S1C. Characteristics of newborn study participants whose plasma was subjected to metabolomic profiling are described in Table S1.Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS) (Metabolon, Morrisville, NC, USA) was employed to identify and measure metabolites in the human newborn plasma (Evans et al., 2009Evans A.M. DeHaven C.D. Barrett T. Mitchell M. Milgram E. Integrated, nontargeted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry platform for the identification and relative quantification of the small-molecule complement of biological systems.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 6656-6667https://doi.org/10.1021/ac901536hCrossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). To ensure sufficient plasma volume for this assay, we pooled plasma samples of 10 participants stratified by sex and treatment prior to MS analysis. MS peaks were identified based on their corresponding retention time/index (RI), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and chromatographic data compared with Metabolon’s library of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. To identify the discriminative overview of the metabolomes classified by grouping, we conducted a supervised sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA). We extracted two components, component 1 (Comp 1) and component 2 (Comp 2), which accounted for 15% and 11% of the variation, respectively (Figure 2B). The first two components elucidated distinct clustering between delayed BCG and early BCG, suggesting that early BCG immunization induced shifts in the plasma metabolome. The top 30 loadings identified metabolites associated with early BCG (orange) and delayed BCG (blue), including several glycerophospholipids (GPCs), increased in the early BCG group (Figure 2C).Of the 674 metabolites detected, 623 passed quality control and assurance. We focused on endogenous biochemicals in which 544 metabolites were included in the analysis (Figures S2A–S2E). Among these metabolites, 55 biochemicals (10.11%) demonstrated significantly differential abundance between the early versus delayed BCG newborn groups (alpha = 0.05) (Figure 2E; Table S2). A majority of significant metabolites belonged to the lipid superclass. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) illustrated higher levels of lipid metabolites in the early BCG compared with the delayed BCG group. In contrast, early versus late BCG administration was associated with lower plasma amino acid concentrations (Figure 2D).BCG-induced prominent shifts in plasma lipid pathwaysCompared with the delayed BCG group, early BCG administration was associated with distinct concentrations of a range of lipid pathways and metabolites. Of note, greater than half of the metabolites whose levels changed significantly (p < 0.05) between the groups belonged to the lipid superclass (Figure 3A ), and 39% of DAMs were of the lysophospholipid (LPL) subclass (Figure 3A). Early BCG administration was consistently associated with robust production of selected sphingolipid, monoacylglycerol, steroid, and LPL metabolites (Table S2). In contrast, palmitoylglycerols and pregnanediol disulfate (progestin steroids) were decreased in the early versus delayed BCG group (Figure 3B; Table S2).Figure 3Early administration of BCG to human newborns in vivo altered the plasma lipidome. Network reconstruction of BCG-altered metabolic pathways demonstrated perturbation of lipid metabolismShow full caption(A) Over half of identified metabolites induced by newborn BCG vaccination belonged to the lipid class, followed by amino acids. Among the significantly altered lipids, 70% (24 identified metabolites) of the lipids belonged to the lysophospholipid (LPL) subclass. Data are presented as counts of significant lipids.(B) Examples of significantly different lipid metabolites between the early versus delayed BCG groups. Boxplots display medians with lower and upper hinges representing first and third quartiles; whiskers reach the highest and lowest values no more than 1.5× interquartile range from the hinge.

The illustrated lipid pathways include lipid biosynthesis pathways (steroid hormone, fatty acid, androgen and estrogen, and cholesterol), glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, omega 6-fatty acid, prostaglandin, and arachidonic acid metabolism.

Because BCG administration at birth was associated with high production of lipid metabolites, our network demonstrated that glycerolipid pathways were interrelated and shared common nodes with other metabolic pathways (e.g., bile acid biosynthesis, galactose GPC, glycosphingolipid, and linoleate metabolism). In addition, we utilized metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA), which considers the quantitative measurement of each metabolite and groups them into functionally related sets from a collection of predefined human metabolic pathways (Jia et al., 2014Jia P.

By January 2022, 75 candidates reached preclinical evaluation in various animal models, 114 vaccines were in clinical trials on humans, and 48 were in the final testing stages. Vaccine platforms range from whole virus vaccines to nucleic acid vaccines, which are the most promising in prompt availability and safety. The USA and Europe have approved vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNa1273). So far, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson \& Johnson, AstraZeneca-University of Oxford, Sinopharm, Sinovac Biotech Gamaleya, Bharat Biotech, and Novavax have documented effective vaccines. Even with technological advances and a fast-paced development approach, many limitations and problems need to be overcome before a large-scale production of new vaccines can start.

	abstract = {Clinical observations and data from immunomodulatory biologic therapies highlight the complexity of the host–pathogen relationship in human tuberculosis (TB), with both insufficient and excessive immune responses leading to disease.Multiple lines of evidence, in humans and animal models, indicate that local factors within each TB lesion govern the outcome; progression and regression can occur simultaneously.Unbiased analyses of co-expressed gene networks demonstrate the role of excessive inflammation in driving TB pathology.Degradation of the extracellular matrix, in particular by the collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1, has emerged as a key pathological event in TB from diverse approaches. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes the human disease tuberculosis (TB) and remains the top global infectious pandemic after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, TB has killed many more humans than any other pathogen, after prolonged coevolution to optimise its pathogenic strategies. Full understanding of fundamental disease processes in humans is necessary to successfully combat this highly successful pathogen. While the importance of immunodeficiency has been long recognised, biologic therapies and unbiased approaches are providing unprecedented insights into the intricacy of the host–pathogen interaction. The nature of a protective response is more complex than previously hypothesised. Here, we integrate recent evidence from human studies and unbiased approaches to consider how Mtb causes human TB and highlight the recurring theme of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover.

Here, we integrate recent evidence from human studies and unbiased approaches to consider how Mtb causes human TB and highlight the recurring theme of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. TB is a chronic and persistent human killer, causing more deaths in total over time than any other pathogen and, currently, is the most important infection after COVID-19. Furthermore, the TB pandemic is likely to worsen due to resources being diverted to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) control [1.Cilloni L. et al.The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tuberculosis epidemic a modelling analysis.EClinicalMedicine. 2020; 28100603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar]. The causative organism, Mtb, has undergone long-term coevolution with humans and is an obligate human pathogen [2.Brites D. Gagneux S. Co-evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 264: 6-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar]. Although there have been significant steps forward, such as new antibiotics for drug-resistant disease, the GeneXpert for rapid diagnosis [3.Walzl G. et al.Tuberculosis: advances and challenges in development of new diagnostics and biomarkers.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2018; 18: e199-e210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar] and a promising new vaccine [4.Tait D.R. et al.Final analysis of a trial of M72/AS01E vaccine to prevent tuberculosis.N. Engl. J. Med. 2019; 381: 2429-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar], standard treatment, diagnosis, and vaccination strategies in most high-incidence TB countries are unchanged. This partly reflects the fact that we still do not understand human TB sufficiently to design transformative strategies to achieve global TB control. Accumulating evidence from biological therapeutics and genomic analyses have suggested that we need to refine our concepts of the spectrum of human disease [5.Boisson-Dupuis S. et al.Inherited and acquired immunodeficiencies underlying tuberculosis in childhood.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 264: 103-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar,6.Morelli T. et al.Infections due to dysregulated immunity: an emerging complication of cancer immunotherapy.Thorax. 2021; (Published online October 4, 2021.)https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-217260Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. Importantly, this includes confirmation in patients that an excessive immune response can be just as harmful as an insufficient response, as illustrated by increased TB incidence with PD-1 inhibition in cancer immunotherapy [6.Morelli T. et al.Infections due to dysregulated immunity: an emerging complication of cancer immunotherapy.Thorax. 2021; (Published online October 4, 2021.)https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2021-217260Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 7.Elkington P.T. et al.Implications of tuberculosis reactivation after immune checkpoint inhibition.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2018; 198: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8.Barber D.L. et al.Tuberculosis following PD-1 blockade for cancer immunotherapy.Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11: eaat2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar]. These new data highlight the fine balance that exists between protection and disease, with either an insufficient or excessive immune response being harmful [9.Tezera L.B. et al.Reconsidering the optimal immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2020; 201: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, the concurrent progression and regression of lesions within the same individual highlights the intricacy of the host–pathogen interaction [10.Lin P.L. et al.Sterilization of granulomas is common in active and latent tuberculosis despite within-host variability in bacterial killing.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,11.Dubos R. Dubos J. The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society. Rutgers University Press, 1987Google Scholar]. A recently emerging theme from unbiased analyses is that ECM turnover is a cardinal feature of human TB, which is well described clinically. Here, we consider human TB in light of these emerging phenomena and the accumulating omics data sets, interpreting these findings alongside clinical characteristics of disease. The Mtb human life cycle involves multiple stages and ironically for such a successful pathogen, Mtb usually reaches a dead end in most humans, failing to transmit to a new host (Figure 1) [12.Ernst J.D. The immunological life cycle of tuberculosis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2012; 12: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar,13.Elkington P.T. Friedland J.S. Permutations of time and place in tuberculosis.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2015; 15: 1357-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. Infection is spread by aerosol from an individual with pulmonary TB, and those with lung cavities (see Glossary) are the most infectious and drive the epidemic [14.Urbanowski M.E. et al.Cavitary tuberculosis: the gateway of disease transmission.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2020; 20: e117-e128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar]. Therefore, for efficient transmission, Mtb must cause immunopathology and lung matrix destruction at the apices of the lung to exit the host and spread onward [15.Elkington P.T. et al.Tuberculosis immunopathology: the neglected role of extracellular matrix destruction.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 71ps6Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar]. In addition, recent PET-CT data suggest that propagation of TB within the lung starts with cavitation, followed by the seeding of new infection foci via bronchial spread [16.Chen R.Y. et al.Radiological and functional evidence of the bronchial spread of tuberculosis: an observational analysis.Lancet Microbe. 2021; 2: e518-e526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar]. Therefore, cavitation appears to be central for disease progression within the host as well as onward transmission in the population. In initial infection, Mtb aerosol droplets are typically inhaled to the well-ventilated lower lobes and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, although definitive proof in humans is difficult to obtain and not all early lesions are basal. Alveolar macrophages are poor at controlling Mtb [17.Cohen S.B. et al.Alveolar macrophages provide an early Mycobacterium tuberculosis niche and initiate dissemination.Cell Host Microbe. 2018; 24: 439-446 e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar], and an initial proliferation generates a large focus of infected cells, often over 5 mm in diameter, as demonstrated by the Ghon focus in the lung base [18.Ghon A. The Primary Lung Focus of Tuberculosis in Children. Churchill, London1916Google Scholar]. During this period, Mtb proliferation is unrestricted by an adaptive host immune response, and it uses a variety of evasion capabilities to proliferate within a range of phagocytes, such as inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion [19.O'Garra A. et al.The immune response in tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 475-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar]. Subsequently, at around 6 weeks, a T cell response develops, which is delayed relative to other respiratory pathogens [20.Ravesloot-Chavez M.M. et al.The innate immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 39: 611-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar] but ultimately leads to more efficacious control of Mtb. By this stage, Mtb needs to have spread to the lung apex, from where it will exit and restart the infectious cycle [13.Elkington P.T. Friedland J.S. Permutations of time and place in tuberculosis.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2015; 15: 1357-1360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. How Mtb travels from the lung base to apex is unknown [21.Murray J.F. Bill Dock and the location of pulmonary tuberculosis: how bed rest might have helped consumption.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 168: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar], although it is likely that infected phagocytes act as Trojan horses carrying the mycobacteria [22.Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,23.Schreiber H.A. et al.Inflammatory dendritic cells migrate in and out of transplanted chronic mycobacterial granulomas in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 3902-3913Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar]. In patients who never develop an adaptive response, Mtb disseminates throughout the body [24.Dheda K. et al.Tuberculosis.Lancet. 2016; 387: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar], with miliary TB nodules across the chest X-ray and in other organs, as described as early as 1700 by Manget [11.Dubos R. Dubos J. The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society. Rutgers University Press, 1987Google Scholar]. This suggests that Mtb spreads extensively, with the goal of forming a niche in the upper lung, where factors favour persistence over immune eradication. Seminal postmortem studies by Opie confirmed Mtb survival in apical lung lesions in otherwise healthy individuals [25.Opie E.L. Aronson J.D. Tubercle bacilli in latent tuberculous lesions and in lung tissue without tuberculous lesions.Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1927; 4: 1-21Google Scholar]. From this niche, Mtb must then cause inflammation, immunopathology, and cavitation to transmit and, although this can happen at any point, most cases reactivate in the first 2 years after infection [26.Behr M.A. et al.Revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis.BMJ. 2018; 362k2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar]. With this time frame, disease evolution is typically a slow process, and changes in the peripheral transcriptome can be detected many months before presentation of active disease [27.Scriba T.J. et al.Sequential inflammatory processes define human progression from M. tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease.PLoS Pathog. 2017; 13e1006687Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar]. As the T cell response develops, Mtb needs to change strategy to reflect the more hostile environment of the host. The recent unpublished identification of changes in Mtb metabolism in response to IFN-γ gives some insight into these events. In sensing host IFN-γ, Mtb is able to change its metabolic rate and transcriptional programme, suggesting that it can respond to host immunological cues [28.Ahmed M. et al.Mycobacterium tuberculosis senses host interferon-γ via the membrane protein MmpL10.bioRxiv. 2021; (Published online November 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468344Google Scholar]. Once into this second phase of the host–pathogen interaction, Mtb must survive on a tightrope, ultimately needing to drive a host immune response that leads to cavitation while avoiding an effective immune response that causes its eradication. The critical structure during this ‘post-primary’ stage is the granuloma (Figure 2) [29.Pagan A.J. Ramakrishnan L. The formation and function of granulomas.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 36: 639-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar]. This was historically thought to be restrictive to Mtb growth, but such concepts of granuloma function and structure have been questioned recently. For example, key studies in the Mycobacterium marinum/zebrafish model have shown that recruitment of monocytes to the granuloma can favour pathogen proliferation [22.Davis J.M. Ramakrishnan L. The role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.Cell. 2009; 136: 37-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,30.Cambier C.J. et al.Mycobacteria manipulate macrophage recruitment through coordinated use of membrane lipids.Nature. 2014; 505: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar]. Indeed, in the same model system, limiting the formation of epithelioid macrophages, which help to wall off the granuloma, in fact helps to limit mycobacterial growth by allowing immune cells access to the granuloma [31.Cronan M.R. et al.Macrophage epithelial reprogramming underlies mycobacterial granuloma formation and promotes infection.Immunity. 2016; 45: 861-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar]. In addition, the traditional ‘sphere-like’ structure of granulomas has been questioned by micro-CT approaches, which suggest a more complex root-like structure of interconnected areas [32.Wells G. et al.Micro-computed tomography analysis of the human tuberculous lung reveals remarkable heterogeneity in 3D granuloma morphology.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2021; 204: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar], in which microenvironments may vary. In addition, whether cavities emerge from the middle of caseous necrotic granulomas or from confluent areas of lipoid pneumonia has also been disputed [33.Hunter R.L. Tuberculosis as a three-act play: a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis.Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2016; 97: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar]. Despite these uncertainties, it is clear that the immune response is both necessary to control infection and essential to drive the tissue destruction that leads to cavitation and spread [15.Elkington P.T. et al.Tuberculosis immunopathology: the neglected role of extracellular matrix destruction.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 71ps6Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar]. Multiple types of immunodeficiency can lead to uncontrolled Mtb infection, such as advanced HIV infection, anti-TNF-α treatment, and mutations within the IFN-γ/IL-12/STAT signalling pathway [19.O'Garra A. et al.The immune response in tuberculosis.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 31: 475-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar]. This has led to research that primarily focuses on identifying what is missing from the immune response to Mtb that leads to disease. However, evidence that an absence of an immunological component(s) identified in individuals who progress to active TB disease does not mean that an excess will be beneficial [34.Karp C.L. et al.Tuberculosis vaccines: barriers and prospects on the quest for a transformative tool.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 264: 363-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar], and, in fact, diverse evidence shows that inflammation, driven by excessive immunity, is damaging in TB. This debate is not new and dates back to bitter disputes between Koch and Virchow [35.Kaufmann S.H. A short history of Robert Koch's fight against tuberculosis: those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.Tuberculosis (Edinb). 2003; 83: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar], over whether Koch’s tuberculin vaccine would cure infection or provoke an immune response that degraded the granuloma and enhanced disease. On the one hand, human studies and animal models provide clear evidence that immunological memory from TB exposure is protective [36.Andrews J.R. et al.Risk of progression to active tuberculosis following reinfection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2012; 54: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,37.Cadena A.M. et al.Concurrent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis confers robust protection against secondary infection in macaques.PLoS Pathog. 2018; 14e1007305Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar]. On the other hand, in a seminal large-scale epidemiological study, Comstock demonstrated the surprising finding that, among tuberculin reactors, those with the greatest delayed-type hypersensitivity response had the highest risk of subsequent development of TB many years later [38.Comstock G.W. et al.The prognosis of a positive tuberculin reaction in childhood and adolescence.Am. J. Epidemiol. 1974; 99: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar]. One potential interpretation is that an excessive immune response to Mtb antigens is detrimental. With the onset of the HIV pandemic, the clinical features differentiating ‘standard’ TB from immunocompromised TB proved that the immune response contributes to lung immunopathology and spread, because cavities are rarely observed in individuals with advanced HIV-related immunocompromise, but occur on immune reconstitution with antiretroviral treatment [39.Kwan C.K. Ernst J.D. HIV and tuberculosis: a deadly human syndemic.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2011; 24: 351-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar]. The demonstration that T cell epitopes of Mtb are hyperconserved compared with nonepitope regions further suggests that the pathogen derives an evolutionary benefit from promoting the host T cell response [40.Coscolla M. et al.M. tuberculosis T cell epitope analysis reveals paucity of antigenic variation and identifies rare variable TB antigens.Cell Host Microbe. 2015; 18: 538-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,41.Comas I. et al.Human T cell epitopes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are evolutionarily hyperconserved.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar]. Most recently, accumulating evidence that anti-PD-1 treatment for cancer can activate latent TB further highlights the danger of an excessive response, with enhanced T cell cytokine production implicated in driving immunopathology [7.Elkington P.T. et al.Implications of tuberculosis reactivation after immune checkpoint inhibition.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2018; 198: 1451-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,8.Barber D.L. et al.Tuberculosis following PD-1 blockade for cancer immunotherapy.Sci. Transl. Med. 2019; 11: eaat2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,42.Kauffman K.D. et al.PD-1 blockade exacerbates Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in rhesus macaques.Sci. Immunol. 2021; 6: eabf3861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,43.Tezera L.B. et al.Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy leads to tuberculosis reactivation via dysregulation of TNF-alpha.eLife. 2020; 9e52668Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar]. Taken together, these observations suggest a complex interplay between innate and adaptive responses, along with mycobacterial load, determining a range of outcomes from disseminated and noncavitary disease in the absence of an effective adaptive immune response, control/elimination with an optimal response, and matrix destruction, cavitation, and spread when excessive localised inflammation occurs [9.Tezera L.B. et al.Reconsidering the optimal immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2020; 201: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. Along similar lines, the concept that the optimal strategy for humans might be to sequester and tolerate Mtb has been proposed, and the breakdown of this tolerance leads to active disease [44.Olive A.J. Sassetti C.M. Tolerating the unwelcome guest; how the host withstands persistent Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,45.Divangahi M. et al.Beyond killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis: disease tolerance.Front. Immunol. 2018; 9: 2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. The fraction of individuals defined as latently infected who in fact harbour viable bacteria is debated [46.Behr M.A. et al.Latent tuberculosis: two centuries of confusion.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2021; 204: 142-148PubMed Google Scholar], but reactivation of Mtb can occur decades after initial infection [47.Lillebaek T. et al.Molecular evidence of endogenous reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis after 33 years of latent infection.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 185: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar], suggesting that this tolerant phenotype can be extremely durable. Adding to the complexity of TB immunology is the fact that TB lesions can have diverse outcomes even in the same individual [11.Dubos R. Dubos J. The White Plague: Tuberculosis, Man, and Society. Rutgers University Press, 1987Google Scholar]. This was summed up neatly by Georges Canetti in 1955, based on examining thousands of tuberculous lungs before the advent of antimicrobial treatment: ‘Consider the bacillus in the lesion, experiencing such different fates in various foci of the same patient, and the same fate in widely different patients; destroyed in a certain histologic reaction and thriving in another nearby’ [48.Canetti G. The Tubercle Bacillus in the Pulmonary Lesion of Man: Histobacteriology and its Bearing on the Therapy of Pulmonary Tuberculosis.The Tubercle Bacillus in the Pulmonary Lesion of Man: Histobacteriology and Its Bearing on the Therapy of Pulmonary Tuberculosis. Springer, 1955Google Scholar]. Likewise, Dubos wrote in 1952 ‘all these processes may occur in the same person either at different times or often simultaneously…which is still almost as much a puzzle today’. This concurrent progression and regression of lesions has been elegantly confirmed in modern imaging studies of infected non-human primates (NHPs) [10.Lin P.L. et al.Sterilization of granulomas is common in active and latent tuberculosis despite within-host variability in bacterial killing.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar]. Consequently, it appears that the outcome of infectious foci is determined at a local granuloma level and not systemically, adding to the challenges of dissecting determinants of outcome. One proposed paradigm is that a balance within granulomas is necessary, with both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators leading to control of infection [49.Cadena A.M. et al.Heterogeneity in tuberculosis.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2017; 17: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,50.Gideon H.P. et al.Variability in tuberculosis granuloma T cell responses exists, but a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is associated with sterilization.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11e1004603Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar]. With their pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response, dendritic cells are also likely to have a central role in shaping the immune response and defining outcome [51.Polak M.E. Singh H. Tolerogenic and immunogenic states of Langerhans cells are orchestrated by epidermal signals acting on a core maturation gene module.Bioessays. 2021; 43e2000182Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. However, because these events occur within tissue, they are challenging to investigate, and studying the host response in the periphery is unlikely to convey sufficient granularity about individual lesions [52.Cliff J.M. et al.The human immune response to tuberculosis and its treatment: a view from the blood.Immunol. Rev. 2015; 264: 88-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar]. Therefore, events determining outcome within individual TB granulomas remain a highly pressing question, and omics analyses should provide a wealth of data to give mechanistic understanding. Recently, several studies reported unbiased analyses aiming to unpick the process. A strategy of comparing TB granulomas with sarcoidosis, a non-infectious granulomatous disease, was utilised to overcome the issue of cell-specific gene expression patterns [53.Reichmann M.T. et al.Integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e148136PubMed Google Scholar]. Diverse analytical approaches demonstrated that the collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) was highly upregulated in TB and was the most significantly differentially expressed gene between TB and sarcoidosis. Analysis of gene correlations identified a seven-gene TB-specific cluster, comprising MMP1, the monocyte chemoattractants C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 and 8 (CCL7 and CCL8), the divalent transition metal transporter solute carrier family 11 member 1 (SLC11A1; formerly known as NRAMP1), oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (OLR1; formerly known as LOX1), family with sequence similarity 124 member A (FAM124A), and galectin 14 pseudogene (LGALS17A). Several of these genes have already been implicated in TB pathogenesis, and consideration of their known functions together informs a putative sequence of events that leads to progression of TB lesions (Figure 3, Key figure). Thus, sequencing of clinical material followed by unbiased analysis generated a hypothesised cascade of disease evolution that can be experimentally investigated. Further bioinformatic analyses in combination with a 3D biomimetic model identified that sphingosine 1 kinase inhibition suppressed Mtb growth, thereby progressing from basic disease understanding to novel therapeutic targets in an unbiased manner [53.Reichmann M.T. et al.Integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e148136PubMed Google Scholar]. Using a similar transcriptomic approach, analysis of gene expression was compared in skin stimulated by tuberculin in patients with TB versus healthy controls [54.Pollara G. et al.Exaggerated IL-17A activity in human in vivo recall responses discriminates active tuberculosis from latent infection and cured disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13: eabg7673Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. Again, MMP1 emerged as a top divergently upregulated gene, and ingenuity pathway analysis suggested that an excessive IL-17 response was a key regulator. The IL-17/MMP1 profile resolved with treatment of infection, implying that Mtb actively primes an excessive, matrix-destructive immune response that can be replicated by a distal antigenic challenge. The authors highlighted the double-edged sword of IL-17 in TB, with data supporting a protective role [55.Ogongo P. et al.Tissue-resident-like CD4+ T cells secreting IL-17 control Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the human lung.J. Clin. Invest. 2021; 131e142014Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,56.Dijkman K. et al.Prevention of tuberculosis infection and disease by local BCG in repeatedly exposed rhesus macaques.Nat. Med. 2019; 25: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar] and a pathological role when present in excess [54.Pollara G. et al.Exaggerated IL-17A activity in human in vivo recall responses discriminates active tuberculosis from latent infection and cured disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2021; 13: eabg7673Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar,57.Bruyn E.D. et al.Inflammatory profile of patients with tuberculosis with or without HIV-1 co-infection: a prospective cohort study and immunological network analysis.Lancet Microbe. 2021; 2: e375-e385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. These two recent studies have the limitation of analysing a distal compartment (mediastinal lymph node and skin), and an identical gene expression profile cannot be assumed in the lung. However, the emergence of MMP1 as a predominant mediator from these two RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) analyses is also consistent with several previous studies. In an early microarray analysis of restimulated macrophages, MMP1 was the most divergently regulated gene in patients with TB, although the authors then focused on a chemokine in validation stages [58.Thuong N.T. et al.Identification of tuberculosis susceptibility genes with human macrophage gene expression profiles.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4e1000229Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar].

	abstract = {Abstract Background Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination can potentially reduce the rate of respiratory infections in vulnerable populations. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of VPM1002 (a genetically modified BCG) as prophylaxis against severe respiratory tract infections including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an elderly population. Methods In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, healthy elderly volunteers (N = 2064) were enrolled, randomized (1:1) to receive either VPM1002 or placebo, and followed up remotely for 240 days. The primary outcome was the mean number of days with severe respiratory infections at hospital and/or at home. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of self-reported fever, number of hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and number of adverse events. Results A total of 31 participants in the VPM1002 group reported at least 1 day with severe respiratory disease and a mean number of days with severe respiratory disease of 9.39 ± 9.28 while in the placebo group; 38 participants reported a mean of 14.29 ± 16.25 days with severe respiratory disease. The incidence of self-reported fever was lower in the VPM1002 group (odds ratio, 0.46 [95% confidence interval, .28–.74]; P = .001), and consistent trends to fewer hospitalization and ICU admissions due to COVID-19 were observed after VPM1002 vaccination. Local reactions typical for BCG were observed in the VPM1002-vaccinated group, which were mostly of mild intensity. Conclusions Vaccination with VPM1002 is well tolerated and seems to have a prophylactic effect against severe respiratory disease in the elderly. Clinical Trials Registration NCT04435379.},

	abstract = {Because of its beneficial off-target effects against non-mycobacterial infectious diseases, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination might be an accessible early intervention to boost protection against novel pathogens. Multiple epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are investigating the protective effect of BCG against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using samples from participants in a placebo-controlled RCT aiming to determine whether BCG vaccination reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19, we investigated the immunomodulatory effects of BCG on in vitro immune responses to SARS-CoV-2.This study used peripheral blood taken from participants in the multicentre RCT and BCG vaccination to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (BRACE trial). The whole blood taken from BRACE trial participants was stimulated with γ-irradiated SARS-CoV-2-infected or mock-infected Vero cell supernatant. Cytokine responses were measured by multiplex cytokine analysis, and single-cell immunophenotyping was made by flow cytometry.BCG vaccination, but not placebo vaccination, reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced secretion of cytokines known to be associated with severe COVID-19, including IL-6, TNF-α and IL-10. In addition, BCG vaccination promoted an effector memory phenotype in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and an activation of eosinophils in response to SARS-CoV-2.The immunomodulatory signature of BCG's off-target effects on SARS-CoV-2 is consistent with a protective immune response against severe COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The Bacille Calmette-Guérin or BCG vaccine, the only vaccine available against Mycobacterium tuberculosis can induce a marked Th1 polarization of T-cells, characterized by the antigen-specific secretion of IFN-γ and enhanced antiviral response. A number of studies have supported the concept of protection by non-specific boosting of immunity by BCG and other microbes. BCG is a well-known example of a trained immunity inducer since it imparts ‘non-specific heterologous’ immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the recent pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 continues to inflict an unabated surge in morbidity and mortality around the world. There is an urgent need to devise and develop alternate strategies to bolster host immunity against the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and its continuously emerging variants. Several vaccines have been developed recently against COVID-19, but the data on their protective efficacy remains doubtful. Therefore, urgent strategies are required to enhance system immunity to adequately defend against newly emerging infections. The concept of trained immunity may play a cardinal role in protection against COVID-19. The ability of trained immunity-based vaccines is to promote heterologous immune responses beyond their specific antigens, which may notably help in defending against an emergency situation such as COVID-19 when the protective ability of vaccines is suspicious. A growing body of evidence points towards the beneficial non-specific boosting of immune responses by BCG or other microbes, which may protect against COVID-19. Clinical trials are underway to consider the efficacy of BCG vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 on healthcare workers and the elderly population. In this review, we will discuss the role of BCG in eliciting trained immunity and the possible limitations and challenges in controlling COVID-19 and future pandemics.},

Given the acknowledged limitation of the generalizability of the knowledge gained from clinical trials,11Gyawali B. de Vries E.G.E. Dafni U. et al.Biases in study design, implementation, and data analysis that distort the appraisal of clinical benefit and ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale (ESMO-MCBS) scoring.ESMO Open. 2021; 6: 100117Google Scholar the appraisal of clinical benefit may also be influenced by ‘real world data’ and the experience of physicians who actively work in the relevant field. The Israeli health system is universal and allows accessible health care to all Israeli citizens. To safeguard economic sustainability, however, not all licensed medications or specific indications are reimbursed. In order to be reimbursed and provided free of charge, licensed drugs, technologies or indications for the treatment of cancer must also be approved by the HTA process of the Ministry of Health (MOH).12Clarfield A.M. Manor O. Nun G.B. et al.Health and health care in Israel: an introduction.Lancet. 2017; 389: 2503-2513Google Scholar The HTA process is undertaken on an annual basis by the ‘health basket’ committee of the MOH,13Seidman G.I. Regulating life and death: the case of Israel’s ‘Health Basket’ Committee.J Contemp Health Law Policy. 2006; 23: 9-63Google Scholar which includes physicians, administrators representing the payers and prominent public figures representing the public. Each year the government allocates a limited budget dedicated for financing new drugs and technologies for the following year. The health basket committee evaluates and ranks all candidate drugs and technologies to select those to be reimbursed within the allocated budget. These budget constraints mandate a thorough evaluation of each candidate, as well as a method to compare between them. As drugs and technologies may be part of any field of medicine, the comparison is extremely difficult, especially when comparing and choosing from diverse fields such as oncology and hematology on the one hand and preventive medicine, diabetes and hypertension on the other hand. In most recent years ∼30% of the budget expansion was allocated to oncology new drugs,14https://www.israelhayom.co.il/health/article/4850070Date accessed: January 10, 2022Google Scholar however this was smaller in 2021 (8%), due to COVID-19 considerations and also a significant allocation for the treatment of diabetes which had a very large budget impact. Three tiers lead to the final decision: (i) scientific evaluation of each new drug/indication/technology by experts in the specific field relevant for the application who submit a ranked listing of new therapies irrespective of cost (i.e. medical oncologists rank drugs and technologies candidates for solid cancer treatment, hematologists review candidates in hematological diseases, etc.); (ii) financial evaluation by the MOH including the total budget impact of incorporating the new therapy; (iii) final evaluation by the health basket committee. For solid tumor oncology submissions, ranked listing is developed by the Israeli Society of Clinical Oncology and Radiotherapy (ISCORT) together with the National Council for the Prevention, Detection and Treatment of Malignant Diseases (The National Council) which is a body appointed by the MOH, using a two-step structured method.(i)Evaluation and ranking of candidate medications/indications in each specialty field by the dedicated expert group of ISCORT (breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal, etc.). The ranking is informed by ESMO-MCBS scores and by independent review of the data.(ii)Submissions from the subspecialty groups are considered by a steering committee of ISCORT and the National Council to formulate a single ranking list for solid tumor oncology. The ranking is also informed by ESMO-MCBS scores, and the expert input of the subspecialty groups. For the year 2022, 77 new indications for 41 drugs were submitted by the MOH for evaluation (Table A1). The most common drugs were targeted therapies (26, 63%) followed by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (7, 17%), chemotherapies (4, 10%) hormonal therapies (2, 5%) and antibody-drug conjugates (2, 5%). The most common indications were targeted therapies (35, 45%) and ICIs (30, 39%). A total of 42 of the 77 indications (55%) were recommended for reimbursement by the professional oncology societies; 30 (39%) indications were recommended for reimbursement from the allocated budget expansion and a further 12 indications (15.5%), which were alternatives to previously approved medications, were recommended for reimbursement but without added cost to the overall budget (Table A2). Treatments with curative intent were given the highest priority. Most submissions for potentially curative intent were recommended for funding (6 of 8, 75%), compared with only 36 of 69 (52%) indications for non-curative treatment. With one exception, the therapies with curative potential that were incorporated in the ranking achieved an ESMO-MCBS score of A. The thirty interventions recommended for reimbursement from the allocated budget expansion were ranked for prioritization. Five adjuvant treatments with curative intent were ranked above treatments with non-curative intent. With three exceptions, all non-curative indications in the top 30 list were scored by the ESMO-MCBS v1.1 as three or above. The exceptions were: (i) olaparib as maintenance therapy for BRCA-mutated, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (ESMO-MCBS v1.1 score 2) was ranked 20/30, because it delayed the need for further chemotherapy which the ISCORT GI-group members considered as a patient benefit not captured by the POLO study design endpoints; (ii) ipilimumab and nivolumab after progression on a single agent ICI in advanced melanoma (ESMO-MCBS v1.1 not scorable) was ranked lowly (24/30). It was strongly endorsed by the melanoma specialty group since it is a common off-label clinical practice, though it is not yet supported by any prospective randomized study and (iii) the study supporting the indication of pembrolizumab for patients with BCG-unresponsive high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer15Balar A.V. Kamat A.M. Kulkarni G.S. et al.Pembrolizumab monotherapy for the treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer unresponsive to BCG (KEYNOTE-057): an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study.Lancet Oncol. 2021; 22: 919-930Google Scholar (ranked 30/30) was a single-arm de-escalation study in the curative setting which is a design that is not scorable using ESMO-MCBS v1.1. This shortcoming is being addressed in the draft version 2.0 which is currently in validation testing. Indications 26-29 were of targeted therapies in rare clinical scenarios with a proven biomarker, tested in early, non-randomized clinical trials, but showing promising efficacy together with a strong biological rationale for their activity. These included sotorasib for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring KRAS G12C mutation,16Skoulidis F. Li B.T. Dy G.K. et al.Sotorasib for lung cancers with KRAS p.G12C mutation.N Engl J Med. 2021; 384: 2371-2381Google Scholar amivantamab and mobocertinib for NSCLC harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion17Park K.

Sahai V. Hollebecque A. et al.Pemigatinib for previously treated, locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 study.Lancet Oncol. 2020; 21: 671-684Google Scholar Evidence for benefit for these indications was derived from single-arm studies with surrogate outcomes of overall response rate and duration of survival. The steering committee considered the rarity of certain driver mutations impacting the feasibility of conducting large registration trials, and accordingly ranked drugs with high response rate and durable response in this setting above what would be dictated by the ESMO-MCBS score. To enhance the value and contain the total budget impact and thus allow inclusion of more drugs, the committee members recommended narrowing some of the indications requested by the sponsors (Table A1). Some of these recommendations were inferred from the indirect comparisons of clinical trials, planned and post hoc subgroup analyses and biological understanding of mechanisms of actions. Thus, the final list recommended that coverage for the use of ICIs in urothelial, esophageal and gastric cancers should be restricted to programmed death-ligand 1-positive tumors only. The 12 indications for which reimbursement decisions did not require additional budget allocation (Table A2) were all for indications where there was little or no added marginal benefit compared with other agents already fully covered by the national insurance scheme, but where listing of an alternative may have a positive economic impact by the introduction of competitive pricing. Since equally effective therapies were already covered by the national insurance scheme, these 12 indications were not ranked for added clinical benefit. Unlike other countries (e.g. Australia, Germany, Austria, France, Canada, Hungary and UK), where submissions are considered on an ad hoc basis, the HTA process in Israel is an annual process whereby all new candidate technologies are considered simultaneously and competitively for funding from constrained budget expansion. Since the annual health basket evaluation mechanism allows only one opportunity for drugs to be reimbursed each year, the ranking process presented here is, to our knowledge, the only annual formal national ranking of all new cancer drugs. Ultimately, this process is not the final determinate. The list and the considerations underlying its development will be presented to the central HTA committee where all the data are reviewed and where value, cost and total budget impact of each indication are additional considerations in the determination of the new therapies to be included in the “free for user” basket of services. This very hands-on experience highlights many of the difficulties challenging HTA processes globally, illustrates the value of incorporating the ESMO-MCBS as part of the process, but also points to the limitations of data objectification where uncertainty regarding the veracity and generalizability of the available data is high. Among the non-curative therapies in addition to the ESMO-MCBS score, clinical experience from the perspective of the members of the relevant subspecialty faculty groups was also influential.},

	abstract = {Endeavors to identify potentially protective variables for COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their Bacillus–Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within 5 years while most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths have occurred in aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed protection being investigated could come from heterologous ‘trained immunity’ (TI) conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. (i.e., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of TI in populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) prevalence would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (24), and erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher TI prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower TI prevalence neighbors. The TI estimates of the populations not the BCG coverage per se, negatively correlated with pandemic phase-matched COVID-19 incidences (r(24): −0.79 to −0.57; p-value < .004), mortality (r(24): −0.63 to −0.45; p-value < .03), and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) data. To decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing or planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of TI as: (a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, (b) small study groups from higher background TI could fail to indicate any protective effect.},

	abstract = {Despite controversy over the protective effect of the BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin) vaccine in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in adults, it has been used worldwide since 1921. Although the first reports in the 1930s had noted a remarkable decrease in child mortality after BCG immunization, this could not be explained solely by a decrease in mortality from TB. These observations gave rise to the suggestion of nonspecific beneficial effects of BCG vaccination, beyond the desired protection against M. tuberculosis. The existence of an innate immunity-training mechanism based on epigenetic changes was demonstrated several years ago. The emergence of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019 revived the debate about whether the BCG vaccine can affect the immune response against the virus or other unrelated pathogens. Due to the mortality of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), it is important to verify each factor that may have a potential protective value against the severe course of COVID-19, complications, and death. This paper reviews the results of numerous retrospective studies and prospective trials which shed light on the potential of a century-old vaccine to mitigate the pandemic impact of the new virus. It should be noted, however, that although there are numerous studies intending to verify the hypothesis that the BCG vaccine may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19, there is no definitive evidence on the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.},

Relevant data will be extracted and synthesized including reporting descriptive and inferential statistics to interpret results. Results: The study will generate a systematic review synthesizing evidence regarding the effects of BCG in curtailing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: The battle against the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over, and as such, further studies must be undertaken to verify the evidence behind initial strategies in battling it. This includes the use of BCG in decreasing COVID-19 incidence and mortality. The results of the review can ultimately guide health authorities and policy makers create evidence-based decisions regarding BCG vaccination policies and clinical trials related to COVID-19 control and prevention.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) was the predominant cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide before the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Although TB vaccines have been successfully used for about 100 years, their full effect is still unknown. In previous studies, a reduced incidence and mortality from a coronavirus disease in TB-vaccinated populations were reported. In this article, we present the secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial, reporting the results of a serological assessment evaluating the effect of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine on SARS-CoV-2. Participants-healthcare workers-were assessed 1-2 and 8 months after the second dose of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine. We found no associations between antibody concentration, BCG revaccination, and additional characteristics, such as age, gender, or Body Mass Index. The effect of BCG vaccination on the immunological response against SARS-CoV-2 requires further research.},

	abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND The objective is to determine the impact of the Bacillus Calmette - Guérin (BCG) vaccine compared to placebo or no vaccine on COVID-19 infections and hospitalisations in healthcare workers. We are using a living and prospective approach to Individual-Participant-Data (IPD) meta-analysis of ongoing studies based on the Anytime Live and Leading Interim (ALL-IN) meta-analysis statistical methodology. METHODS Planned and ongoing randomised controlled trials were identified from trial registries and by snowballing (final elicitation: Oct 3 2022). The methodology was specified prospectively – with no trial results available – for trial inclusion as well as statistical analysis. Inclusion decisions were made collaboratively based on a risk-of-bias assessment by an external protocol review committee (Cochrane risk-of-bias tool adjusted for use on protocols), expected homogeneity in treatment effect, and agreement with the predetermined event definitions. The co-primary endpoints were incidence of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19-related hospital admission. Accumulating IPD from included trials was analysed sequentially using the exact e -value logrank test (at level α = 0.5% for infections and level α = 4.5% for hospitalisations) and anytime-valid 95%-confidence intervals (CIs) for the hazard ratio (HR) for a predetermined fixed-effects approach to meta-analysis (no measures of statistical heterogeneity). Infections were included if demonstrated by PCR tests, antigen tests or suggestive lung CTs. Participants were censored at date of first COVID-19-specific vaccination and two-stage analyses were performed in calendar time, with a stratification factor per trial. RESULTS Six trials were included in the primary analysis with 4 433 participants in total. The e -values showed no evidence of a favourable effect of minimal clinically relevance (HR \&lt; 0.8) in comparison to the null (HR = 1) for COVID-19 infections, nor for COVID-19 hospitalisations (HR \&lt; 0.7 vs HR = 1). COVID-19 infection was observed in 251 participants receiving BCG and 244 participants not receiving BCG, HR 1.02 (anytime-valid 95%-CI 0.78-1.35). COVID-19 hospitalisations were observed in 13 participants receiving BCG and 7 not receiving BCG, resulting in an uninformative estimate (HR 1.88; anytime-valid 95%-CI 0.26-13.40). DISCUSSION It is highly unlikely that BCG has a clinically relevant effect on COVID-19 infections in healthcare workers. With only limited observations, no conclusion could be drawn for COVID-19 related hospitalisation. Due to the nature of ALL-IN meta-analysis, emerging data from new trials can be included without violating type - I error rates or interval coverage. We intend to keep this meta-analysis alive and up-to-date, as more trials report. For COVID-19 related hospitalisations, we do not expect enough future observations for a meaningful analysis. For BCG-mediated protection against COVID-19 infections, on the other hand, more observations could lead to a more precise estimate that concludes the meta-analysis for futility, meaning that the current interval excludes the HR of 0.8 predetermined as effect size of minimal clinical relevance.

We conducted a scoping review of the literature to clarify the available evidence regarding the effect of BCG therapy in preventing respiratory complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science for related studies up to October 2022.In total, 35 publications and trials were included. One animal study, two observational studies, and six finalized trials measured the effect of BCG administration on respiratory complications of COVID-19. The remaining publications included eight unfinished trials, 12 ecological studies, and six observational studies that did not directly measure respiratory complications but assessed overall mortality of the disease and were included as an adjunct to our study. All trials involved vaccinating adults to protect them against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and measured respiratory symptoms or the need for intensive respiratory support as the primary or secondary aim of the study. One trial that exclusively included at-risk adults between 18 and 60 years old showed a decreased chance of respiratory complications as the secondary outcome of the study. Another trial that exclusively evaluated this effect on the elderly (60 years and older) as the primary aim of the study reported no protective effect against respiratory complications. The remaining literature provided mostly inconclusive evidence.The majority of the literature on the protective effect of BCG against respiratory complications of COVID-19 is inconclusive.},

	abstract = {In Hong Kong, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations are administered intradermally at birth to prevent TB infections. Containing an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, BCG vaccines induce granulomatous scars in immunocompetent infants at the injection site. Inflammation of the BCG scar is a common feature of Kawasaki disease in children. The investigators launched the ‘COVID-19 Vaccination in Adolescents’ study (COVA, NCT04800133) in May 2021 to study the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccines in adolescents. Of the 165 participants who received the BNT162b2 vaccine, 101 were male and 64 were female. Within the study, a 14-year-old Chinese girl presented with erythema and increased induration of the BCG scar, occurring as a wheal after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Symptoms manifested near the injection site 18- and 8-h following doses 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 1). The elevation of the wheal and diameter of the erythema peaked at 3 cm on day 2 after dose 1 (Fig. 1) and resolved on day 4. For dose 2, the elevation of the wheal peaked at day 1, but the diameter of the erythema continued to grow until day 3 to 8 cm (Fig. 1), resolving on day 4. The elevation of the wheal after dose 2 was significantly higher than that of dose 1. In both episodes, after the injections the wheal was painful upon palpation and did not blanch with pressure. The patient also reported fatigue, mild fever, and myalgia after both doses, but no pain at the injection site, only at the BCG wheal. The symptoms for both doses resolved spontaneously without intervention. At the time of writing, another case of BCG scar inflammation in an 11-year-old girl was reported within our trial (Fig. 1). There were also reports of individuals who received influenza or COVID-19 mRNA vaccines presenting with similar symptoms 1–3 days after vaccination.1-3 Additionally, viral infections such as measles and type 6 human herpes virus have been described to cause BCG erythema.4, 5 However, the two adolescent girls in this case did not report any BCG scar erythema for influenza vaccinations nor viral infections. As most of the patients were born in Hong Kong, they all received BCG vaccinations at birth; however, the parents of the 14-year-old Chinese girl reported that she received the BCG vaccine when she was 2-months old. In general, all the participants involved in the study have had the BCG vaccination for at least 10 years. The symptoms in both cases proved to be transient without need for intervention. Clinicians and vaccinators should be aware of this reaction to prevent delay in the second dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

	abstract = {Together with climate change, both the geopolitical events in Ukraine and social disruptions in supply chains from the COVID-19 pandemic could produce global food shortages or even mass starvation events. Promising new interventions include vaccines to prevent infectious causes of malnutrition or infections disproportionately causing death among the malnourished. Together with climate change, both the geopolitical events in Ukraine and social disruptions in supply chains from the COVID-19 pandemic could produce global food shortages or even mass starvation events. Promising new interventions include vaccines to prevent infectious causes of malnutrition or infections disproportionately causing death among the malnourished. Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, widespread hunger and malnutrition were important global health threats. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in addition to overweight and obesity, the two major forms of malnutrition include undernutrition, related primarily to protein–energy malnutrition, and micronutrient-related malnutrition, especially from iron, vitamin A and iodine deficienciesi. However, in most of the world’s low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), reduced nutritional intake does not occur in isolation. Chronic infections including diarrheal illness and parasitic infections accelerate both undernutrition and micronutrient-related malnutrition [1.Walson J.L. Berkley J.A. The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2018; 31: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar]. For children, the various forms of undernutrition include low weight-for-age referred to as underweight, which can progress to a more severe wasting form. Stunting or low height-for-age can result from chronic undernutrition or frequent recurrences of undernutrition and infection, with the consequence of impairing both cognitive and physical development. Micronutrient deficiency, especially iron but also zinc and others, can also exacerbate the cognitive and physical impairments of stunting. The WHO estimates that approximately 462 million adults are underweight, while in 2020 approximately 149 million children under 5 years were stunted, and 45 million children wasted. Moreover, almost one-half of the under-5-years’ childhood deaths result from undernutrition, predominantly in LMICsi. The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (UW-IHME) found that protein–energy malnutrition caused 212 000 deaths among children under 5 years in 2019ii, such that protein–energy malnutrition is a leading cause of childhood suffering and deaths globally. In addition, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia was responsible for 42 300 deaths. The African Continent and South and Southeast Asia share some of the highest rates of both iron-deficiency and protein–energy malnutrition. Many of these regions also suffer the highest rates of infectious diarrheal disease and illness, as well as hookworm infection, and malaria (and other conditions), each of which exacerbates undernutrition. Table 1 shows a comparison between the geographic distribution of protein–energy malnutrition, and iron micronutrient deficiency, hookworm infection, and diarrheal disease and illness.Table 1Comparison of protein–energy malnutrition with iron micronutrient deficiency and diarrheal diseaseaData from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019).ConditionPrevalence (no. of cases)DeathsDisability-adjusted life yearsWorst affected areasProtein–energy malnutrition148 million212 00015.3 millionEast AfricaSahelian West AfricaIndonesiaMesoamericaHaitiIron-micronutrient deficiency and anemiaNot determined42 30031.3 millionEast AfricaSahelian West AfricaYemenIndia and PakistanPapua New GuineaHookworm disease173 million—1.0 millionEast and Central AfricaSahelian West AfricaIndiaPapua New Guinea, LaosMalaria181 million643 00046.4 millionCentral and West AfricaIndiaDiarrheal disease and illness99 million1.53 million80.9 millionEast AfricaSahelian West AfricaIndiaa Data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019). Open table in a new tab In 2022, United Nations (UN) Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned of a looming global food shortage with potentially 1.6 billion people not having enough to eat and 250 million living at the brink of famine. The UN World Food Program finds that millions of people already face imminent famine, and project hundreds of millions are at risk for mass starvation. The major driver has been the war in Ukraine, where a significant percentage of the world’s wheat and other grains and fertilizer is produced, in combination with drought, high temperatures from climate change, and supply-chain interruptions due to the pandemic. The interruptions from the war and the other factors listed in the preceding text caused the UN’s food and agricultural price index to reach all-time highs. Many food-insecure areas of the world, including the African continent and South and Central Asia can no longer afford food imports, or face reduced access due to their dependence on Ukraine. The most vulnerable areas include East Africa and the Sahelian countries of West Africa, where climate change has produced soaring temperatures, profound drought, and diminished agricultural production. Certain human infections, especially chronic infections, can cause micronutrient deficiency, undernutrition, or in some cases both forms of malnutrition. In turn, undernutrition can often worsen or exacerbate the clinical course of infectious diseases. Human hookworm infection is a classic example of a chronic infection producing a micronutrient deficiency. In Africa, hookworm often combines with malaria and schistosomiasis. Both children and women of reproductive age, including those who are pregnant, are especially vulnerable to the combined anemia that results from this polyparasitism [2.Kinyoki D. et al.Anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2018.Nat. Med. 2021; 27: 1761-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. Persistent or recurring diarrhea, especially from bacterial pathogens, may cause even greater levels of protein–energy malnutrition and stunting [1.Walson J.L. Berkley J.A. The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2018; 31: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar]. An exhaustive study to determine the etiology of childhood diarrheal illness concluded that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) producing heat stable toxin (ST-ETEC) and Shigella rank among the most important bacterial causes of moderate or severe diarrhea in children under 5 years, in addition to cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infection [3.Kotloff K.L. Bacterial diarrhoea.Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 2022; 34: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. However, in some localities, Campylobacter, Vibrio cholera O1 (cholera), and Aeromonas are also important bacterial causes; with increasing rotavirus vaccination coverage the bacterial pathogens are becoming the dominant etiologies in LMICs (with many strains exhibiting multidrug resistance). In addition to the diarrhea-causing pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis induces chronic inflammation leading to wasting or cachexia through the production of a cachectin inflammatory mediator [4.Baazim H. et al.The interplay of immunology and cachexia in infection and cancer.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2022; 22: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. The relationship between infection and malnutrition is bidirectional, meaning that the infections highlighted in the preceding text promote undernutrition, while undernutrition can simultaneously increase susceptibility to these infections [1.Walson J.L. Berkley J.A. The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2018; 31: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar]. The mechanisms proposed include destruction of the integrity and biogenesis of the gut and respiratory cellular mucosa, alterations in host microbiomes (microbiota), and dysfunctions in the hemopoietic and lymphoid organs and liver and biliary system [1.Walson J.L. Berkley J.A. The impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 2018; 31: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar,4.Baazim H. et al.The interplay of immunology and cachexia in infection and cancer.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2022; 22: 309-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar]. Severe and chronic protein malnutrition also increases susceptibility to the orofacial destruction of noma and wasting or pancytopenia from kala-azar opportunistic infections. Malnutrition also exacerbates the progression and severity of HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The link between tuberculosis and malnutrition is particularly noteworthy due to profound cachexia – the well-known consumptives in modern human history [5.Sinha P. et al.Undernutrition and tuberculosis: public health implications.J. Infect. Dis. 2019; 219: 1356-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar]. Based on the discussion in the preceding text, the major infectious and tropical diseases expected to amplify or exacerbate a pending food insecurity crisis, include three parasitic infections – human hookworm infection, schistosomiasis, and malaria; and two enteric bacterial infections – shigellosis and ST-ETEC, and tuberculosis (Table 2).Table 2Selected malnutrition vaccines in developmentDiseaseVaccine/antigensOrganization or companyStage of developmentRefsHookworm infectionHookworm vaccineTexas Children’s CVD \& HookVac ConsortiumPhase 1–2 trials[6.Adegnika A.A. et al.Safety and immunogenicity of co-administered hookworm vaccine candidates Na-GST-1 and Na-APR-1 in Gabonese adults: a randomised, controlled, double-blind, phase 1 dose-escalation trial.Lancet Infect.

Three different vaccines for schistosomiasis, also for Africa and Brazil, are also in development [7.Hotez P.J. et al.Advancing the development of a human schistosomiasis vaccine.Trends Parasitol. 2019; 35: 104-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. They each comprise a single recombinant protein found on the surface tegument (or elsewhere) of the schistosome parasite, with two antigens completing Phase 1 testing, and a third about to enter the clinic. The antimalaria vaccine Mosquirix is the first human parasitic disease vaccine to achieve licensure (by the European Medicines Agency, EMA) and approval by the WHO; it was developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals in collaboration with PATH (a nonprofit Seattle, Washington-based PDP formerly known as the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health) following years of research on the circumsporozoite protein [8.Nadeem A.Y. et al.MosquirixTM RTS, S/AS01 vaccine development, immunogenicity, and efficacy.Vaccines (Basel). 2022; 10: 713Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. A second recombinant protein vaccine known as R21 produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) was formulated with a Matrix-M adjuvant from Novavax. The R21–Matrix-M vaccine has also shown early promise for efficacy in Phase 2–3 pediatric clinical trials in Africa [9.Datoo M.S. et al.Efficacy of a low-dose candidate malaria vaccine, R21 in adjuvant Matrix-M, with seasonal administration to children in Burkina Faso: a randomised controlled trial.Lancet. 2021; 397: 1809-1818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar], as has a live-attenuated sporozoite PfSPZ vaccine from Sanaria. While there are no licensed shigellosis vaccines, there are several in various stages of development. Among the lead candidates is a detoxified Shigella flexneri 2a Artificial Invasin Complex (InvaplexAR-DETOX) developed at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), and two vaccines supported by the Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust, including a monovalent S. flexneri 2a vaccine comprising a synthetic O-carbohydrate conjugated to tetanus toxoid, and generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA) AltSonflex1-2-3 O-antigen vaccine undergoing testing in Kenyaiii. The WHO has issued a guidance document for future Shigella vaccines [10.World Health Organization WHO Preferred Product Characteristics for Vaccines against Shigella. World Health Organization, 2021Google Scholar]. Several ETEC vaccines are in development, including an oral whole cell ETVAX vaccine and an injectable subunit CssBA vaccine combined with a double-mutant heat-labile toxin from the Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRC), WRAIR, and PATHiii. Two combined Shigella-ETEC vaccines are also in development, including ShigETEC from Eveliqure Biotechnologies GmbH in Austria, which is a live attenuated Shigella bacterium lacking in toxic lipopolysaccharide O antigens, yet expressing ETEC toxoids [11.Khalil I. et al.Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccines: priority activities to enable product development, licensure, and global access.Vaccine. 2021; 39: 4266-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,12.Girardi P. et al.Evaluation of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ShigETEC, an oral live attenuated Shigella-ETEC vaccine in placebo-controlled randomized phase 1 trial.Vaccines (Basel). 2022; 10: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. Another is CVD 1208S-122, a live attenuated Shigella hybrid from the University of Maryland CVD. Finally, there is an expanding pipeline of vaccine candidates for tuberculosis in development [13.Dockrell H.M. McShane H. Tuberculosis vaccines in the era of Covid-19 - what is taking us so long?.EBioMedicine. 2022; 79103993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. These vaccines use an array of biotechnologies ranging from recombinant proteins on familiar and next-generation adjuvants, virus vectors, and several that use live BCG genetically modified to express Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens. Because BCG is already in use in many LMICs as a neonatal vaccine, it is potentially feasible to replace the existing vaccines with one of these next-generation BCG constructs [13.Dockrell H.M. McShane H. Tuberculosis vaccines in the era of Covid-19 - what is taking us so long?.EBioMedicine. 2022; 79103993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar]. Universal immunization programs have been shown in India and elsewhere to produce positive nutritional benefits for child growth [14.Solis-Soto M.T. et al.Relationship between vaccination and nutritional status in children: analysis of recent demographic and health surveys.Demogr. Res. 2020; 42: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar]. In addition, there are at least 20 promising malnutrition vaccine candidates in mid- or late-stage development that could be accelerated to help avert an imminent food catastrophe or even potential mass starvation events. Such vaccines could be prioritized, just as the global policymakers accelerated COVID-19 vaccines starting in 2020. Such actions would be consistent with UN Decade of Action on Nutrition commitments launched in 2016 (and extending until 2025) to strengthen national health and food systems around nutritional needs and emergencies. Until now, vaccines and vaccine development activities have not featured prominently in food system security strengthening, but this approach offers promise. While averting an imminent food catastrophe may not be possible, there are options for accelerating malnutrition vaccines to reduce its impact. Given the unanticipated time lags and inequality gaps that we witnessed with COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic, we must begin this process imminently. Otherwise, we risk similar vaccine access and inequity gaps, and all-too-familiar yet unnecessary losses in human life.

	abstract = {Since December 2020, extensive vaccination campaigns have been introduced in Europe, using novel messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) vaccines. A wide range of adverse cutaneous events have been reported since the advent of vaccination programmes,1, 2 but to our knowledge, there have been no reports of inflammatory changes occurring on surgical scars or wounds. Very recently, inflammation occurring in Bacille Calmette‑Guérin (BCG) scars following mRNA vaccination were observed, both on old scars as well as new ones, as part of a randomized trial evaluating whether BCG protects against Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19).3, 4 We currently report the occurrence of inflammatory painful reactions, limited to the area of previous surgical procedures, in four otherwise healthy Caucasian patients (Table 1), 24–48 h after the first dose of the novel mRNA anti-SARS-CoV-2 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine (BNT162b2). Two men and a woman had very recent scars, the excision having been performed 2–6 weeks before vaccination, while the other woman had surgery 6 months before vaccine injection. The intensity of the reaction varied from local erythematous swelling to bullous formation and purulent discharge, which were very painful even in the milder reactions (Fig. 1). All patients had surgery to remove basal cell carcinomas, radically excised. Consulting the medical charts, the procedure required an internal absorbable vicryl suture in three patients, while in one patient, the reaction occurred before removal of the external suture (prolene). The site of vaccine injection was not affected with inflammatory changes, nor did the patients experience other general or bothersome symptoms. The inflammatory reaction on scars was treated with local mixed antibiotic-corticosteroid cream, resolving within 10–14 days, and left no sequelae. No further reactions occurred following the second dose of the vaccine. The cases were reported to the Italian Pharmacovigilance Authority. Variable cutaneous reaction patterns have been associated with COVID-19 vaccination, including delayed type IV hypersensitivity reactions to dermal filler injections, inflammatory changes on previous radiation sites and old BCG scars re-activation.1-4 In our patients, the wound healing or remodelling phase of the surgical scars or the presence of residual suture materials might have stimulated some immunological mechanisms, similar to forms of hypersensitivity reactions. However, due to the self-healing, benign course of the reaction, no other invasive investigations were performed in our patients to clarify the pathogenesis. The observation is reported to the medical community to raise attention and collect further experiences or studies. In conclusion, dermatologists are actively committed to supporting the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and enhancing continuous safety monitoring.5 The risk of inflammation at scar sites should be considered, and inform the patients that although it could be bothersome, it is usually a self-limiting event and not a reason to avoid vaccination. In our experience, the event did not recur at the following vaccination doses. The patients in this manuscript have given written informed consent to the publication of their case details. None of the authors have conflicts of interest to disclose. None. All authors contributed equally to the manuscript and had the opportunity to revise and approve the final text.

	abstract = {35% of all COVID-19 deaths occurred in Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs). In a healthy general population, wearables have shown promise in providing early alerts for actionable interventions during the pandemic. We tested this promise in a cohort of SNFs patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and admitted for post-acute care under quarantine. We tested if 1) deployment of wearables is feasible in the setting of SNFs and 2) they can provide early and actionable insights into deterioration. This prospective clinical trial has been approved by the WIRB (HSA-001) and registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04548895). We deployed two commercially available devices - both detecting continuously every 2-3 minutes heart rate (HR), HR variability, respiratory rate (RR) and - uniquely - providing the following biometrics: 1) the wrist-worn bracelet (wearable) yielded continuous oxygen saturation (O2Sat), 2) the under-mattress ballistocardiography (BCG) sensor tracked in-bed activity, tossing, and sleep disturbances. Patients also underwent routine monitoring by staff every 2-4 h. For death outcomes, cases are reported due to the small sample size. For palliative care versus at-home discharges, we report mean士SD at p<0.05. From 12/2020 - 03/2021, we approached 26 PCR-confirmed SarsCoV2-positive patients at two SNFs: 5 declined, 21 were enrolled into monitoring by both sensors (female=13, male=8; age 77.2士9.1). We recorded outcomes as discharged to home (8, 38%), palliative care (9, 43%) or death (4, 19%). The O2Sat threshold of 91% alerted for intervention. The wearable captured hypoxic events below 91% nine times as often as the routine intermittent pulse oximetry. In the patient deceased, two weeks prior we observed a wide range of O2Sat values (65-95%) captured by the wearable and not noticeable with the routine vital sign spot checks. In this patient, the BCG sensor yielded a markedly reduced RR (7/min) in contrast to 18/min from two routine spot checks performed in the same period of observation as well as compared to the seven patients discharged home over a total of 86 days of monitoring (RR 19士4). Among the patients discharged to palliative care, a total of 76 days were monitored, HR did not differ compared to the patients discharged home (68士8 vs 70士7 bpm). However, we observed a statistically significant reduction of RR at 16士4/min vs 19士4/min as well as the variances in RR and activity of palliative care patients vs patients discharged home. We demonstrate that wearables and under-mattress sensors can be integrated successfully into the SNF workflows and are well tolerated by the patients. Moreover, specific early changes of oxygen saturation fluctuations and other biometrics herald deterioration from COVID-19 two weeks in advance and evaded detection without the device. Wearable devices and under-mattress sensors in SNFs hold significant potential for early disease detection.},

As part of a pragmatic clinical trial in bladder cancer, we collected information regarding the impact of COVID-19 at participating sites, which provides insight into how the pandemic has imposed constraints on clinical bladder cancer care and research. METHODS: Starting in May 2020, we distributed a monthly survey to sites participating in CISTO (Comparison of Intravesical Therapy and Surgery as Treatment Options for Bladder Cancer, NCT0393382). The survey included questions about interruptions in routine clinical bladder cancer care, specifically assessing elective surgery restrictions, impact on radical cystectomy, TURBT, office cystoscopies, intravesical therapy, and intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) supply. We report survey responses for sites that responded to > 50% of the monthly surveys from May 2020 to October 2021. RESULTS: From May 2020 through October 2021, 21 sites (66%) had > 50% monthly response rate. The time periods of greatest limitations on bladder cancer procedures (Figure 1) were May-July 2020, Dec-Jan 2020/2021, and Sept-Oct 2021, corresponding to the peak waves of COVID-19 infections. Elective surgery was most affected, with limitations or holds in those time periods at up to 76%, 38%, and 28% of CISTO sites, respectively. Most of the restrictions involved surgeries that required inpatient stays, potential intensive care unit admission, and staffing shortages. 9 sites (28%) experienced transient BCG shortages during the survey period. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical activity was most limited during the initial COVID-19 surge in Spring/Summer 2020. Despite higher COVID-19 infection rates in subsequent waves, bladder cancer clinical activity has been maintained at CISTO sites throughout the COVID pandemic. Periodic BCG shortages continue to affect bladder cancer care across the US.

We wish to express our gratitude to all our previous authors who have published their research with us over the recent years, this increase in impact factor is a testament to the important work you have performed and published with us.After the tough recent times globally, we still have many papers covering the pressing issue of COVID-19 and its' treatment. However, we also continue to publish many highly impactful papers across our scope discussing cancer, allergens and suppressive immunotherapies, combination therapies, biomarkers for individualized treatment and novel agents and their targets.In this Foreword I would like to take this opportunity to look back on the previous year’s highlights of Immunotherapy and summarize the most well received papers of 2021 that I would encourage you to read if you have missed them.Content highlights of 2021Throughout Volume 13 of Immunotherapy we continued to publish high impact content across the range of topics covered under Immunotherapy.

In this piece de la Fuente et al. commented on the possibility that boosting the immune response to glycan α-Gal with a broader and not pathogen-specific immunity may contribute to the control of COVID-19 and also to potential reinfections by COVID-19 variants or pathogens.Sands et al.‘s Clinical Trial Protocol detailing their ACCIO three arm study evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab addition to the current chemotherapy standard of care treatment for resected non-small-cell lung cancer was our second most read paper of those published in 2021 [2].Our most highly read Research Article from 2021 outlined the first in-human study of pasotuxizumab, a bispecific T-cell engager targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen [3]. The data from Hummel et al. supported pasotuxizumab safety in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and provided evidence of bispecific T-cell engager monotherapy efficacy in solid tumors.Our fourth and fifth most read papers were both focused on COVID-19. Ali et al. investigated the feasibility of producing hyperimmune anti-COVID-19 intravenously administrable immunoglobulin from pooled convalescent plasma. The aim was to provide a safe and effective passive immunization treatment option with the safety and efficacy of this crucial groundwork is now being evaluated by clinical trial [4]. Additionally, the paper has been the second highest cited paper that was published in Immunotherapy in 2021.Meanwhile Pinheiro et al. provided their unique perspective on the proposed role for vitamin D and DPP-4 inhibitors to modulate cytokine storm, reduce the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent disease progression [5]. Furthermore, they provided investigation rationale for this proposed VIDPP-4i combination strategy, in a paper that was one of the most discussed papers across social media and was also one of our highly cited papers of the year.As well as readership, the number of citations also gives an indication of the most impactful papers from this year, of which the top three most cited are shown in Table 2.Table 2.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypothesis regarding the protective effect of BCG vaccine on Covid 19 has been proposed since the start of the SARS CoV2 pandemic. BCG vaccination seems to have non- specic benecial effects against other viral infections like RSV, HSV2, Yellow fever and Inuenza. The aim was to nd out signicant association between childhood BCG vaccination and the outcome of COVID 19 in a sample of adult patients who were admitted during the peak of the infection in India. METHODS: We enrolled 370 adult patients by complete enumeration method, admitted in our hospital in July 2020. We looked for the presence of BCG scar and studied the clinical prole of every patient. All of them were followed up till discharge or death and their outcomes were categorised as favourable or unfavourable. The clinical data and the signicance of the presence of scar on the outcome was analysed. RESULTS: 87% patients had a favourable outcome.25% patients had comorbidities like Hypertension, Diabetes Mellitus, Chronic lung disease and Chronic kidney disease. BCG scar was present in 73% of all patients. 75.78% of the patients who had favourable outcome had evidence of the vaccination as compared to the 24.22% without the scar (p value=0.001). This result was however not seen in patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus suggesting that they could be confounding variables in the study and independent risk factors of poorer outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Adults vaccinated with BCG in childhood seem to have better progression and outcome of Covid 19. Prospective clinical trials would help conrm these results.},

	abstract = {Clinical labs belong to a mature industry and fulfill a critical function in the health-care value chain. We examine factors that influence the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn in clinical labs. We hypothesize that with respect to learning about cost: (i) organizational design, such as the extent of outsourcing can impede the opportunity to learn, (ii) quality focus (measured by mortality rates and length of stay (LOS)) can reduce the motivation to learn, and (iii) related task variety (measured by product-mix breadth) and information technology investments can enhance the ability to learn. Our empirical tests calibrate learning effects on disaggregate (technical and supervisory hours and cost) and aggregate (salary and total direct cost) cost and time pools. Using longitudinal data from clinical labs in California for the period 1997–2015, we find that clinical labs with greater cumulative output have lower average costs, consistent with learning effects in clinical labs. We also find results consistent with our hypotheses about the contextual factors that influence learning rates in clinical labs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of learning rates with implications for budgeting, forecasting, and performance measurement. The results highlight that learning can be a crucial source of cost reduction in health-care settings. Les facteurs qui influencent la courbe d'apprentissage : données relatives à l'évolution des couts dans les laboratoires cliniques Les laboratoires cliniques appartiennent à un secteur développé et remplissent une fonction critique dans la chaine de valeur des soins de santé. Les auteurs examinent les facteurs qui influencent l'occasion, la motivation et la capacité d'apprendre dans les laboratoires cliniques. En ce qui concerne l'apprentissage en matière de couts, les auteurs émettent l'hypothèse que : (i) le design organisationnel, tel que l'étendue de l'externalisation peut entraver la possibilité d'apprendre, (ii) l'accent mis sur la qualité (mesurée par les taux de mortalité et la durée du séjour) peut réduire la motivation à apprendre, et (iii) la variété des tâches connexes (mesurée par l'étendue de la gamme de produits) et les investissements dans les technologies de l'information peuvent améliorer la capacité à apprendre. Les tests empiriques menés par les auteurs étalonnent les effets de l'apprentissage sur des groupes de couts et de temps désagrégés (heures et couts techniques et de supervision) et agrégés (salaire et cout direct total). En utilisant les données longitudinales des laboratoires cliniques en Californie pour la période 1997-2015, les auteurs constatent que les laboratoires cliniques avec une plus grande production cumulative ont des couts moyens plus faibles, ce qui est cohérent avec les effets de l'apprentissage dans les laboratoires cliniques. Les résultats des auteurs sont aussi conformes à leurs hypothèses sur les facteurs contextuels qui influencent les taux d'apprentissage dans les laboratoires cliniques. Leurs conclusions contribuent à une meilleure compréhension des taux d'apprentissage et ont des implications pour la budgétisation, la prévision et la mesure de la performance. Les résultats soulignent que l'apprentissage peut être une source cruciale de réduction des couts dans les établissements de soins de santé. In 1968, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) emphasized that long-term competitive gains accrue to those firms where employees learn on the job and organizations facilitate such learning (Henderson 1968). Decades later, learning continues to be a source of competitive advantage in many industries (Cho et al. 1998; Argote and Ingram 2000; Madsen and Desai 2010; Reeves et al. 2013). Productivity gains from learning, termed the “learning curve,” accrue as a decrease in unit production cost as a function of cumulative volume.1 A wealth of literature shows the beneficial effects of learning on long-term costs (Arrow 1962; Krugman 1987; Lucas 1988) and competitive advantage (Spence 1981; Ghemawat and Spence 1985; Amit 1986; Thompson 2012; Leiblein et al. 2021).2 Although significant variations in learning rates exist across organizations (Dutton and Thomas 1984; Argote et al. 2021), the underlying reasons for such variations are not well established (Edmondson et al. 2001; Pisano et al. 2001; E. G. Anderson and Lewis 2014). We address a question of importance to accounting research and practice—namely, what are the contextual factors that affect learning rates related to cost improvements? Contextual factors can influence the opportunity to learn through organizational design, the motivation to learn signaled by the organization's focus on cost efficiency, and the ability to learn through transfer of successful learning routines (Argote et al. 2003; Dahlin et al. 2018). Learning can be either autonomous or induced from elements within and outside the organization (Dutton and Thomas 1984). Autonomous learning occurs on the job, and is often referred to as “learning-by-doing” (Adler and Clark 1991). Autonomous learning yields productivity improvements from task repetition and experience. Autonomous learning usually occurs in stable environments and can be augmented by organizational design or adoption of new technology. Induced learning, which requires the recalibration of organizational routines, arises from deliberate activities and proactive managerial efforts. Induced learning thrives in contexts where the environment is complex, rapidly changing, or uncertain, and tasks are not well defined (Wiersma 2007; Nembhard and Tucker 2011). We study autonomous learning in an industry with immense contemporary relevance, namely, clinical labs. Clinical labs conduct health screening, monitoring, and diagnostic testing, and are a critical element of the health-care value chain. In Canada, approximately 260 million clinical lab tests were performed annually, while in the United States, over 7 billion clinical lab tests were performed each year before the COVID-19 pandemic ballooned the demand for lab testing to greater levels.3 Our empirical analyses use data for the period 1997–2015 from clinical labs in California. Drawing on learning theory, we model cumulative average hours or cost as a nonlinear function of the cumulative number of units produced (Wright 1936; Datar and Rajan 2017).4 Results indicate significant learning rates. We predict and find that, first, outsourcing reduces learning rates because it impedes opportunities to retain and transfer knowledge. Second, in labs with a high-quality focus, greater emphasis is given to remedying quality failures, which reduces the motivation to learn about factors that influence cost. Third, the ability to learn is strengthened when employees engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (Schilling et al. 2003; Clark et al. 2018). Specifically, product-mix breadth—the number of distinct types of tests—enhances the ability to learn from related task variety. Finally, information technology (IT) tools augment the ability to learn by facilitating knowledge sharing and the construction of organizational memory repositories. Accordingly, we find higher learning rates in labs with IT applications encompassing lab management, and employee and task interfaces. Overall, we find robust evidence of learning for technical and supervisory labor time and cost, ranging from an 82% to an 88% learning curve.5 We make several contributions. First, while extant research shows the benefits from learning curves (Argote 2013; Lapré 2011) in new tasks or processes, such as the installation of an assembly line (Epple et al. 1996) or introduction of a factory shift (Epple et al. 1991), our study calibrates learning curves over almost two decades in a mature industry. We thus add to Wiersma (2007) and provide new insights about how learning curves are influenced by contextual factors related to the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn. Our study has implications for management accounting, specifically for budgeting and variance analysis. If learning curves are not factored into budgets, efficiency variances will be confounded (Steven 1999). To enable appropriate intervention strategies, learning rate variances should be separated from price, volume, or efficiency variances to prevent forecasting errors, distorted budgeted costs, and imprecise efficiency variances (Yelle 1979). Second, we show that opportunities to learn diminish when activities are not coordinated within organizational boundaries. Outsourcing can result in the loss of key organizational knowledge, hamper knowledge retention, and impede coordination routines (Reagans et al. 2005). Our results add to Wiersma (2007), who finds that using temporary employees in the labor mix enhances learning rates. A difference in our setting is that when the lab outsources, the benefits from learning curves accrue to the vendor. In contrast, when the lab keeps the activity in-house (with temporary employees), the benefits from learning curves accrue within the organization. Thus, while Wiersma shows that the mix of employees is an important driver of learning rates, we show that organizational design in terms of whom the employee works for can influence learning rates. We also show that the organizational context, such as a quality-related focus, can influence the motivation to learn. Organizations can enhance their ability to learn through task design and IT investments. Finally, we contribute to the accounting literature on cost functions. Prior research documents asymmetric behavior of cost in response to changes in volume (M. C. Anderson et al. 2003) attributed to differences in managerial resource adjustment decisions in declining versus expanding demand (Chen et al. 2012; Banker and Byzalov 2014; Banker et al. 2018). Cost asymmetry has implications for analyst forecasts (Weiss 2010; Ciftci et al. 2016), earnings prediction models (Banker and Chen 2006), and the use of cost signals in fundamental analysis (M. C. Anderson et al. 2007). While managerial resource adjustments introduce nonlinearity in short-run cost functions, learning curves represent another form of nonlinearity in short- and long-run cost functions. Beginning with the empirical documentation by Wright (1936) of a logarithmic pattern of unit cost reduction that occurs with cumulative volume, the learning curve has been a topic of interest in research and practice. Learning curves have been documented in a variety of job costing settings, such as aircraft manufacturing (Benkard 2000; Wright 1936), ships (Rapping 1965), technology support (Kim et al. 2012), and process costing settings such as petroleum (Hirschmann 1964) and chemicals (Lieberman 1984). Learning curves are theoretically and empirically distinct from economies of scale and managerial adjustment costs. Learning curves occur from cumulative experience on the task, while economies of scale occur with a larger current volume. Scale economies arise when fixed costs can be spread over a larger number of units (which reduces average cost as volume increases) and from contracting benefits (which reduce marginal costs as volume increases) (Scherer and Ross 1990). Learning curve effects occur with accumulated volume, economies of scale materialize from the current output rate (Spence 1981), and adjustment costs result in an asymmetric impact of a change in volume on change in cost.6 Learning can be autonomous or induced (Dutton and Thomas 1984). Autonomous learning represents “learning by doing,” where performance improvements occur from task repetition. These improvements are gradual, although they can be influenced by employee characteristics and task properties. Autonomous learning is likely in contexts with well-defined tasks that are executed in stable environments and where knowledge growth or technology developments are steady rather than abrupt.7 Induced learning results from deliberate activities spurred by external or internal events (Sorensen 2002) and occurs in contexts that are not well defined, or where the environment is dynamic. Induced learning requires considerable changes to organizational routines (Nembhard and Tucker 2011). Research in organizational learning attests to the beneficial effect of repeated task execution on learning curves (Yelle 1979; Epple et al. 1996; Zollo and Winter 2002; Boone et al. 2008). Experience provides exposure to employees to learn from the knowledge accumulated by other employees, particularly in mature firms where documentation of processes allows the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (Argote and Miron-Spektor 2011; Aranda et al. 2017). Such learning is widespread in the health-care industry and in common parlance it is described as “practice makes perfect” (Gaynor et al. 2005). A variety of settings such as cardiac surgery, radiology, joint replacement, and other intensive care procedures show the effects of learning on procedure times, turnaround times, and error resolution (Pisano et al. 2001; Edmondson et al. 2003; Reagans et al. 2005; Huckman and Pisano 2006; Tucker et al. 2007). While learning is associated with performance improvements in new tasks or processes (Adler and Clark 1991; Epple et al. 1991; Epple et al. 1996; Pisano et al. 2001), its effect on the cost of mature tasks and processes is understudied (Wiersma 2007). Clinical laboratory testing is an example of a task that gives employees opportunities for cost reduction as they acquire experience. Clinical lab tasks follow a standardized structure and pre-determined process routines, which sets the stage for improvements in productive efficiency by learning from experience. Thus, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 1 (H1).The average cumulative direct cost per unit decreases with experience. Learning rates vary as a function of the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn provided by the organizational context (Argote et al. 2003). Contextual factors include organizational design, quality focus, task structures, and resource investments. We discuss the contextual factors in more detail below. Knowledge transfer is enhanced when employees have opportunities to learn from each other through observation and interaction (Simon 1991; Loch et al. 2013). An employee can accumulate knowledge by observing and interacting with proximate colleagues performing the task (Borgatti and Cross 2003; Nadler et al. 2003; see Epple and Romano 2011 for a review). Accordingly, knowledge is more likely to be transferred among employees within the same organization than across organizations (Argote et al. 2003; Zellmer-Bruhn 2003; A. A. Kane et al. 2005). On the other hand, outsourcing can cause physical separation of intermediate tasks, which produces coordination problems and impedes knowledge transfers (Leavy 1996; E. G. Anderson and Parker 2002; Clement and Puranam 2018). Lab outsourcing is organized such that certain aspects of clinical laboratory testing move to the external venue of the vendor. For example, Quest Diagnostics manages portions of lab activities, such as testing, managing supplies, and procurement for its client hospitals. This manner of structuring lab activities reduces opportunities to gain expertise over the entirety of the testing process because the vendor's employees and the lab's employees are unlikely to be co-located, which deters the transfer of tacit knowledge (Catalini 2018; S. Lee 2019). Outsourcing introduces a need to fit the vendor's outputs into the existing lab structure and can disrupt learning. When parts of a lab's activities are outsourced, they generate increased effort to integrate the outsourced component into the existing clinical and business support systems and can impede learning rates.8 Integration problems require new task routines and team structures, and change the scope of employees' responsibilities, which negatively affects knowledge transfers (Goodman and Leyden 1991; Pisano et al. 2001; Lewis et al. 2007). When different parts of lab activities have heterogenous learning rates, outsourcing can influence learning rates depending on which parts of activities are outsourced. We predict: Hypothesis 2 (H2).Labs with higher levels of outsourcing have less favorable learning rates, relative to other labs. To learn and transfer knowledge successfully, organizations must aspire to acquire knowledge by identifying efficiency-enhancing combinations to perform an activity and form new routines through a process of deliberate choice and path-dependent trial and error (Pisano et al. 2001). Learning occurs when organizations have the motivation to search for solutions to existing or anticipated problems and make improvements to routines and capabilities (Cyert and March 1963; Nelson and Winter 1982). This process of learning from the searching for solutions to current and potential future problems is referred to as problemistic search (See Posen et al. 2018 for a review). Organizations vary in what they set as aspirations, what they consider as “problems,” and what types of problems warrant initiation of problemistic search, and such variations are rooted in the relative importance attached to each of these problems. The search for cost efficiencies is less important in organizations where the prominence is placed on other critical performance dimensions (Wiersma 2007). Although most organizations give prominence to cost and quality, the degrees of emphasis differ, which has implications for problemistic search and learning curve. Problemistic search efforts to identify opportunities to improve cost efficiencies can be impeded when quality improvement takes center stage (Cyert and March 1963; Kanfer and Ackerman 1989; Gavetti et al. 2007). In health-care settings, quality is a crucial metric that is the object of medical, public, and regulatory attention for all organizations. The lab testing process is complex, and quality failure in the form of medical errors can occur in patient identification, specimen collection, data entry, storage, and transport. Errors can also occur in the post-analytic stage when the test results are interpreted, communicated, and utilized in treatment regimens. The technical specification released by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/TS 22367, 2008, Section 3.1) defines laboratory error as “failure of planned action to be completed as intended, or use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim, occurring at any part of the laboratory cycle, from ordering examinations to reporting results and appropriately interpreting and reacting to them.” Hence, an ideal measure to examine the effect of a lab's quality focus on learning rates is a quality metric at the lab level. However, clinical lab quality is difficult to measure because quality-related errors accrue downstream in the patient treatment process. Indeed, poor lab quality is a major source of diagnostic errors, with potential catastrophic patient outcomes such as mortality (Timbrook et al. 2016). Consequently, lab quality is evaluated using a patient-centric approach in terms of any eventual negative impact on the patient (Graber 2005; West et al. 2009). Moreover, errors in lab testing cannot be fixed through rework, particularly if an error occurs in the post-analytic stage.9 Accordingly, labs often have to make trade-offs between quality and cost, and labs with a strong quality focus may be more motivated to engage in quality-related learning and less motivated to engage in cost-related learning. We propose, therefore: Hypothesis 3 (H3).Quality focus adversely affects learning rates. Research indicates that ability to learn is enhanced when organizations engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (Clark et al. 2018). High-level abstract knowledge results from participation in related tasks that are bounded within the realm of an overall task know-how or schema. Health-care tasks are replete with knowledge structures that are based on interpretive schemata that refer to shared assumptions, values, and frames that “give meaning to everyday activities and guide how organization members think and act” (Rerup and Feldman 2011, 578). Related task variety enhances knowledge about the broader schema or “knowledge construct,” increases absorptive capacity, and enables better learning (Schilling et al. 2003; Narayanan et al. 2014). In related tasks, the process or content knowledge about any one task is portable and can help in the execution of other tasks (Mitchell 2000; Wiersma 2007; Narayanan et al. 2009), independent of the level of scale or specialization in each activity (March and Simon 1958; Schilling et al. 2003; Clark and Huckman 2012). Cognitive psychology provides a framework to predict how related task variety influences learning. If a task is organized as a specialized activity in which individuals perform the same task repeatedly, their skill development occurs at the level of the core task. Thus, individuals obtain an in-depth understanding of a specific problem. On the other hand, if individuals are exposed to multiple related tasks, they develop abstract knowledge, that is, a schema, about a set of tasks (Lapré and Nembhard 2010). Such learning is conducive to cost efficiency in the health-care industry, which deploys skilled employees in structured environments where knowledge can be synthesized across related domains (Clark and Huckman 2012). Hospitals that cover a wide spectrum of lab testing services enhance the skillset to consider and adjust to “critical covariations in the environment” (Reber 1989, 233). Thus, we predict the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 4 (H4).An increase in related task variety increases learning rates. Although learning by doing results in knowledge creation, the ability to transfer such knowledge is constrained when it remains unrecorded. IT enhances the ability of organizations to record such experience and retrieve it when needed (Levitt and March 1988). For effective learning, new knowledge must be acquired, retained, and transferred. IT encourages the automation of routines and avoids the cost involved in cumbersome manual record keeping or human coordination (G. Kane and Alavi 2007). For example, Mukhopadhyay et al. (2011) find that IT system upgrades in physician referral systems enhance coordination ability and enable learning. IT can facilitate knowledge management, enhance organizational memory, and reduce search costs for efficient inputs (Adler et al. 1999; Edmondson et al. 2001). Standardized templates and reports generated through IT increase opportunities for knowledge transfer across employees and workstations. Benefits of IT tools in managing business opportunities are well documented (Kearns and Lederer 2003; K. Iyengar et al. 2015; Mithas and Rust 2016; Benitez et al. 2018), particularly in health care. In 2001, the Institute of Medicine stressed the clinical and operational roles of IT capability in health-care outcomes including safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, efficiency, and equity. For example, hospitals in China leveraged IT infrastructure for COVID-19 awareness programs (Yan et al. 2020). Such programs can be useful in reducing the spread of diseases when society faces a new outbreak. However, substantial cross-sectional variations exist in the extent of investment in IT capabilities across health-care organizations. The ability of a health-care organization to derive value from IT is a function of munificence—that is, resources invested in IT (Burke and Menachemi 2004). Although its benefits percolate to all sectors, IT can be valuable in health-care organizations where information creation, retention, retrieval, and dissemination is central (J. Lee et al. 2013). Even a routine lab test involves coordination of activities across many departments, and delays or errors can have devastating consequences on the health-care value chain. IT can be particularly valuable in departments that employ skilled labor and perform routine tasks because it provides the potential to improve workflow, communication, and coordination. For example, business applications such as accounting, billing, and contract management can improve process efficiencies. Clinical IT systems, such as electronic medical records, can have beneficial effects on costs by reducing duplication. At the lab level, IT can integrate functions and technologies such as patient registration systems, generating reports, and analyses of lab performance. Therefore, we predict: Hypothesis 5 (H5).IT investments increase learning rates. The US clinical lab industry generates about $100 billion in annual revenues, employs over 620,000 people, and accounts for about 2% of total health-care costs (ACLA 2017). Laboratory tests are crucial at all stages of medical care including diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, and preventative care. Physicians and staff order clinical lab tests for approximately 98% of inpatients and 29% of outpatients (Ngo et al. 2017). Clinical labs can be hospital-based, physician office-based, or stand-alone entities (e.g., Quest Diagnostics). About 55% of all medical lab tests are conducted in hospital-based labs (Wolcott et al. 2008). The task process begins when a specimen is collected from a patient (Fischbach and Dunning 2009). The lab technician ascertains that the specimen is appropriate and sends it to the lab where scientific testing occurs. Results are transmitted to the physician, who makes a diagnosis. At the pre-analytic stage, a lab technician prepares the patient and collects the specimen. At the analytic stage, a lab technician processes the specimen and generates test results. The lab technician must determine that the test was properly conducted before forwarding the results to the physician for the post-analytic stage. Results that are positive for a disease or a medical condition are frequently reanalyzed to reduce false positives. Clinical labs employ licensed staff who have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited laboratory science program, passed a certification exam from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and have technical anatomical knowledge (e.g., dealing with patients with diabetes), practical knowledge (e.g., which needle to use), and problem-solving knowledge (e.g., prevent excessive bleeding). We use the cumulative average cost model where cost decreases by a constant percentage as the total quantity of units produced is doubled. The cumulative average formulation is a flexible functional form and appropriate for settings such as ours where data are available in historical blocks (Wright 1936; Miller et al. 2012; Mislick and Nussbaum 2015). This formulation reduces the measurement error in estimating the learning rate when a long time-series is used. We express the learning curve as AC = a x − b $$ AC=a\{x\}^\{-b\} $$ , where b is the learning rate or learning index, a is the number of labor hours or cost of producing the first unit, and AC is the cumulative average cost (or cumulative hours per unit) of producing x units.10 Data for clinical lab tests for the period 1997–2015 are from the California Hospital Annual Financial Disclosure database of the Office of State Health Planning and Development (OSHPD). The sample includes only hospitals for which audited lab-level data are available on direct and indirect cost pools. Our final sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 5,054 lab-year observations for 211 to 297 labs for the period 1997–2015.11 Table 1 provides a breakdown of observations used in the analyses. Appendix 1 contains variable definitions. Appendix 2 contains the location in the OSHPD database for each variable. We compute separate learning rates for time and cost for two types of labor: (i) technical labor directly engaged in the testing process and (ii) supervisory and managerial labor overseeing technical labor. Labor time (Hours per unit) is the natural log of cumulative hours worked by lab technicians (Technical hours per unit), or managers and supervisors (Supervision hours per unit) in a clinical lab up to and including year t, divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. Labor cost (Wages per unit) is the natural log of the sum, up to and including year t, of technical hours worked by lab technicians (Technical wages per unit) or managers and supervisors (Supervision wages per unit) in the lab multiplied by the deflated average hourly wage rate for the corresponding labor pool (lab technicians or supervisors) and divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. Learning rates for the aggregate employee cost pool for all the employees working in the clinical lab (Salary per unit) is the natural log of deflated total salaries and wages incurred by a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by that lab up to and including year t. This variable (Direct cost per unit) is the natural log of cumulative deflated direct expenses of a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. Lab direct expenses include lab-specific overheads but exclude allocated hospital-level overheads. Notes: The figure shows the difference between the effect of learning curves and economies of scale on cost per unit. Economies of scale involve a movement along the average cost curve, whereas learning curve involves a shift in the average cost curve. Outsourcing is measured as the natural logarithm of average deflated purchased services in a clinical lab for three years (including the current year) as a percentage of},

	abstract = {Abstract Vaccines induce antigen-specific immunity which provides long-lived protection from the target pathogen. Trials especially from high infectious disease areas indicated that the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induces in addition non-specific immunity against various pathogens and thereby reduces overall mortality. Although recent trials produced conflicting results, it was suggested that BCG might protect from non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and could be used to bridge time until a specific vaccine against novel respiratory diseases like COVID-19 is available. We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCT) published between 2011 and August 5 th , 2022 providing evidence about non-specific effects after BCG vaccination, assessed their potential for bias, and meta-analyzed relevant clinical outcomes. We excluded RCTs investigating vaccination with an additional vaccine, unless outcomes from a follow-up period before the second vaccination were reported. Our search identified 15 RCTs including 32160 participants. Vaccination with BCG caused an estimated 49% decrease in risk for respiratory infections (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.33-0.80) with substantial heterogeneity between trials (I 2 =80%; p\&lt;0.00001). There was evidence for a protective effect on all-cause mortality of 22% if follow-up was restricted to one year (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.96); we did not find evidence for an effect when we considered longer follow-up (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.02). Infection-related mortality after BCG-vaccination was reduced by 33% (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46-0.99), mortality for sepsis by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41-0.93). There was no evidence for a protective effect of BCG vaccination on infections of any origin (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-1.00), COVID-19 (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.61-1.14), sepsis (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62-1.07) or hospitalization (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.92-1.14). According to these results, depending on the setting, vaccination with BCG provides time-limited partial protection against non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and may reduce mortality. These findings underline BCG’s potential 1) in pandemic preparedness against novel pathogens especially in developing countries with established BCG-vaccination programs but limited access to specific vaccines; 2) in reducing microbial infections, antimicrobial prescriptions and thus the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for additional RCTs to clarify the circumstances under which BCG’s non-specific protective effects are mediated.},

	abstract = {On April 29, 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine (AZD1222) was administered to a 41-year-old female patient on the direct lateral portion left deltoid muscle (in the center of the deltoid muscle, midway between the acromion and the deltoid tuberosity). About 12 hours after vaccination, a mild fever of 37–38ºC with localized heat and tenderness, erythema, and edema developed around the inoculation site. Pain of visual analog scale (VAS) 6 was also accompanied by active movement of the left shoulder. Although she took only 500 mg of acetaminophen three times a day and observed these symptoms without any other special treatments, she showed no improvement even after 3 days. Hence, she visited our hospital as an outpatient; her body temperature was 36.9°C, and there was erythema of about 7 cm in diameter around the vaccination site, accompanied by swelling and heat. Tenderness was most severe at the injection site. Resting pain was VAS 4–5, and it was most severe with VAS 6 in abduction of the shoulder joint. She did not have any specific underlying medical conditions. Blood analysis indicated an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 28 mm/h and a normal C-reactive protein (CRP) level of 0.3 mg/dL. We recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in consideration of the possibility of infection because the pain pattern was more severe than that of other patients and the patient had symptoms for a longer period of time. MRI presented edema in the left deltoid muscle and superficial soft tissue and a fluid signal (∼120 mm length) on the T2-weighted image (T2WI) (Fig. 1A). The radiologist suggested local myofascitis of the deltoid muscle as a preliminary diagnosis. Due to the possibility of infection, a first-generation cephalosporin (2 g/day in 2 divided doses) was administered intravenously for 2 days. She was still taking 500 mg of acetaminophen three times a day. Subsequently, there was VAS 2 pain and mild tenderness, a reduction in the erythema and swelling, and the body temperature was 36.3°C. However, after 5 days, similar symptoms recurred, and the size of the erythema around the vaccination site was reduced to about 5 cm in diameter; the erythema, warmth, and edema decreased; and the tenderness was similar. Resting pain was VAS 4, and pain during active motion was VAS 5. The white blood count, ESR, and CRP level were still within the normal range. In collaboration with an infectious disease physician, we changed the antibiotic to a third-generation cephalosporin (2 g/day in 2 divided doses) to be administered intravenously for 3 days; however, there was no improvement in symptoms. Hence, piperacillin sodium 4 g/ tazobactam 0.5 g was administered 3 times a day every 8 h. Two days later, most symptoms were alleviated, except for mild swelling. On the last follow-up, MRI performed approximately one month after vaccination revealed that although edema was present in the deltoid muscle and superficial soft tissue, and the fluid signal (about 74 mm length) had improved compared to the previous MRI (Fig. 1B). On April 30, 2021, the AstraZeneca vaccine (AZD1222) was administered to a 41-year-old female patient on the direct lateral portion left deltoid muscle (in the center of the deltoid muscle, midway between the acromion and the deltoid tuberosity). After vaccination, she had no systemic symptoms, only pain and tenderness of VAS 3 around her vaccination site, and a slight warmth. For 24 h after vaccination, although she took 500 mg of acetaminophen three times, her pain worsened to VAS 7. The passive range of motion of the glenohumeral joint was within the normal range, but active abduction was limited to 90–100° due to pain. Also, she had mild tenderness and swelling around the vaccination site, but there was no heat or erythema. She continued to take only acetaminophen for a week without any other treatment. However, after 10 days, her pain did not improve, and she visited our institution's outpatient clinic. She complained of VAS 5 pain and had no systemic symptoms other than local tenderness and mild swelling around her inoculation area. Her body temperature was 36.3 °C. She did not have any specific underlying medical conditions. Blood analysis indicated an ESR of 7 mm/h and a normal CRP level of 0.1 mg/dL. We recommended an MRI for two reasons: persistent pain and exclusion of complications such as infection. On MRI, the T2WI showed a high signal (∼65 mm long) and strong enhancement in the lateral portion of the deltoid muscle (Fig. 2A). She was not given antibiotics because her blood analysis was within the normal range, and there was no evidence of infection such as localized warmth and erythema. We recommended follow-up while taking analgesics, as symptoms were improving and there were no other obvious signs of infection. She was prescribed 162.5 mg of acetaminophen + 18.75 mg of tramadol hydrochloride three times a day. After 10 days, her pain had improved to VAS 2, and she still had pain during active abduction, but the range of motion was unrestricted. She also showed improvement in tenderness around the vaccination site and no other signs of infection. On the last follow-up, MRI performed approximately 4 weeks after vaccination revealed that the previously seen high signal intensity had decreased on the T2WI (Fig. 2B).

Here, we report two cases of localized myofascitis after the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which were diagnosed by MRI. In both cases, there was muscle pain and tenderness around the deltoid muscle within 24 hours after administration of the vaccine. Despite taking acetaminophen-based analgesics, the pain improved slowly or was maintained until 10 to 15 days after administration of the vaccine. Tenderness and pain are the most common local side effects that may occur after the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine, although these symptoms usually resolve within 48 hours. However, in our two cases, the pain became uncontrolled and severe after 48 h, and myofascitis of the deltoid muscle was confirmed on MRI, which also revealed it to be the cause of the atypical severe shoulder pain after the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In the first case, the patient showed symptoms of pain and heatness, erythema, and tenderness. When an infection is suspected, empirical antibiotics can be used based on symptoms, serological tests, and imaging evidence in situations where it is difficult to identify the causative organism. Staphylococcus aureus is known to be the most common causative agent of these diseases.2Bernard P. Bedane C. Mounier M. Denis F. Catanzano G. Bonnetblanc J.-M.

These cases suggest that the possibility of myofascitis should be considered if the pain at the injection site worsens without improvement or maintained after 48 hours post administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Patients may not show any abnormalities in the blood test, and they are accompanied by pain to the extent that active shoulder movement is impossible. In addition, tenderness around the injection site is commonly complained of, and some may show signs of infection such as fever, redness, and swelling. It is recommended to consider blood tests to measure the white blood count, ESR, and CRP levels. According to previous reports, rare but serious side effects, such as necrotizing fasciitis, may occur after vaccination. So, if there are signs of local infection and it is difficult to identify the causative agent, empirical antibiotics are recommended. It is suggested to administer broad-spectrum antibiotics including gram-negative bacteria. In addition, if the patient does not respond to these conservative treatments, we suggest considering imaging tests such as MRI in consideration of serious complications such as necrotizing fasciitis. The possibility of myofascitis should be considered if there is severe pain at the inoculation site that persists even 48 h after the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine. In addition, the possibility of infection should always be considered, blood tests and imaging tests to rule it out are recommended, and empirical antibiotic administration should be considered.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background COVID-19 vaccination has been advocated as the most effective way to curb the pandemic. But with its inequitable distribution and slow rollout, especially in low- to middle- income countries, it will still take a long time before herd immunity is achieved. Alternative measures must therefore be explored to bolster current COVID-19 vaccination efforts. In particular, the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine has been studied extensively as to its proposed conferment of non-specific immunity against different infections, including COVID-19. The aim of this study, therefore, is to evaluate the current evidence on the effectiveness of national BCG vaccination policies in reducing infection and mortality of COVID-19. Methods A systematic review was conducted between April to August 2021 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Literature was retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane, HERDIN, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM). Studies conducted from January 2020 to August 2021 that fell within Level 1A to 2C of the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine were included in the review. Quality assessment was performed using the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool and a quality assessment checklist for ecological studies adapted from Betran et al. Results A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Nine studies reported significant association between BCG vaccination policies and COVID-19 outcomes, even when controlling for confounding variables. In addition, among other mandated vaccines, such as pneumococcal, influenza, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, and measles, only BCG vaccination showed significant association with decreased COVID-19 adverse outcomes. However, other factors also showed positive association with COVID-19 outcomes, particularly markers of high economic status of countries, higher median age, and greater population densities. Conclusion The lower incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in countries with mandated BCG vaccination may not solely be attributable to BCG vaccination policies, but there is still some evidence that demonstrates a possible protective effect. Clinical trials must be continued before recommendations of BCG vaccinations are to be used as an alternative or booster vaccine against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Age-related expression for a disease is well known. The applicability of such an expression for SARS-CoV-2 prompted this review. Whenever an infection is highly prevalent, the younger age groups get more affected. But this is not seen in COVID-19. The severity of COVID-19 disease is more and sometimes fatal in adults when compared with children and found to be less severe. This shows a striking difference as generally children tend to get more affected with most of the respiratory viruses. Can this be explained by the differences that are observed in their oro-pharyngeal, lung, nasopharyngeal and gastrointestinal microbiota? This review addresses the potential of resident microbiota for the spectrum of expressions in susceptible population through various mechanisms. In the nasopharynx, where microbial interactions and competition may limit the growth of SARS-CoV-2, children are more extensively colonized with viruses and bacteria than adults. One study found no discernible differences in the nasopharyngeal microbiota between SARS-CoV-2 patients and healthy individuals, whereas other investigations found significant differences in the oro-pharyngeal, lung and gut microbiota between these groups. There is a reduced load of bacteria in the gut microbiota of the patients who are infected with COVID-19; especially the bacterial phyla such as are found to be very less in the gut but there is relatively a higher load of other organisms such as It is known that have a lot of anti-inflammatory properties and show decreased gastrointestinal ACE-2 expression. The microbiota in the human gastrointestinal tract differs with age. Children’s guts exhibit higher concentrations of These variations in the gut microbiota of patients have also been noted between those who do and those who don’t excrete SARS-CoV-2 in their feces. However, these results, which are based on the gut flora of each patient, may be affected by factors like food, age, use of antibiotics and their immune system. This relation between the gut microbiota and the severity of COVID-19 disease in patients is studied and it is still unclear. Randomized control trials (RCT) of BCG are being conducted to lessen the severity of COVID-19. Oral polio vaccination and the measles-containing vaccine (MCV), in addition to BCG, have been proposed as potential factors in the difference in COVID-19 severity. To lessen the severity of COVID-19, a randomized control trial of the MMR vaccine has been planned. Understanding the mechanism underlying the age-related variations in COVID-19 severity through the colonizing microbial flora and off-target effects of live vaccines (BCG, etc.) would provide important cognizance and open up many opportunities for the management and cure of this novel infection.},

	abstract = {Background Since the emerging of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in late 2019 and the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring it as a pandemic, a race to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 has started worldwide and therefore huge efforts and resources have been put into achieving it. This review summarizes COVID-19 vaccines in phase III and IV. Methods A review of the scientific literature was conducted using the medical subject heading (MeSH) word “COVID-19 vaccines” on PubMed and the words “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2” and “vaccine” on ClinicalTrials.gov as of January 24, 2021. The published WHO reports on candidate COVID-19 vaccines were reviewed. For clinical trials, only phase III and IV COVID-19 vaccines were included. Results Of the 1300 citations identified on January 24, 2021, 81 were eligible and included in this review. According to WHO report of January 22, 2021, there were 237 candidates vaccines in development and among them 64 vaccines were in advanced stages of development. On the same date, on ClinicalTrials.gov, there were 66 registered COVID-19 vaccines clinical trials on phase III and IV. Thirty seven were new candidates vaccines on phase III, 23 were BCG vaccines including five on phase VI, three were measles vaccines on phase III and three were polio vaccines (one on phase VI and one on phase III). Conclusions Despite safe and effective vaccines are available many challenges remain including logistic difficulties concerning mass production, supply, storage, cold chain, administration at community level and equitable distribution to the most vulnerable populations. Hence the need to continue preventive measures including, hand wash, wearing mask, cough and sneeze etiquette and social distancing.},

Basing on previously confirmed antiviral features of BCG and first statistic data reports, BCG usage in COVID-19 prevention was claimed and its potential molecular mechanism was searched. In scientific literature there was 10 publications proving several possible mechanism of BCG interaction with SARS-CoV-2 infection immune response. The most often was cross-reactivity between various BCG and SARS-CoV-2 antigens, including those crucial for their clinical effects. In most cases, those antigens linking was shown according to bioinformatical research.

	abstract = {Abstract Background Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination has been hypothesised to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection, severity, and/or duration via trained immunity induction. Methods Healthcare workers (HCWs) in 9 Dutch hospitals were randomised to BCG or placebo vaccination (1:1) in March/April 2020 and followed for one year. They reported daily symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 test results, and healthcare-seeking behaviour via a smartphone application, and donated blood for SARS-CoV-2 serology at two time points. Results 1,511 HCWs were randomised and 1,309 analysed (665 BCG and 644 placebo). Of the 298 infections detected during the trial, 74 were detected by serology only. The SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates were 0.25 and 0.26 per person-year in the BCG and placebo groups, respectively (incidence rate ratio=0.95; 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.21; p=0.732). Only three participants required hospitalisation for COVID-19. The proportions of participants with asymptomatic, mild, or mild-to-moderate infections, and the mean infection durations, did not differ between randomisation groups. Unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models showed no differences between BCG and placebo vaccination for any of these outcomes either. The percentage of participants with seroconversion (7.8% versus 2.8%; p=0.006) and mean anti-S1 antibody concentration (13.1 versus 4.3 IU/ml; p=0.023) were higher in the BCG than placebo group at 3 months but not at 6 or 12 months post-vaccination. Conclusions BCG vaccination of HCWs did not reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections nor infection duration or severity (on a scale from asymptomatic to moderate). In the first 3 months after vaccination, BCG vaccination may enhance SARS-CoV-2 antibody production during SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

	abstract = {A 46-year-old Caucasian man presented with psoriasis flare-up, which occurred a day after second dose of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT16B2b2 mRNA vaccine. The patient had been suffering from plaque psoriasis for 24 years. During the last 21 months, his psoriasis was completely clear (PASI 0 points) due to deucravacitinib treatment in the clinical trial. Before entering the clinical trial two years ago, the severity of his psoriasis was assessed as PASI 18 points. For the last 48 weeks, he has been in the open-label phase of above-mentioned trial receiving deucravacitinib 6 mg orally once daily. Regarding COVID-19 vaccination, the patient received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT16B2b2 mRNA vaccine and experienced only pain at the site of vaccine injection lasting for 24 hours. Five days after the second dose (administered 3 weeks after the first shot), he noticed psoriatic lesions on his lower legs, which quickly spread with time extending to the whole lower extremities and trunk. He presented again with pain at the injection site accompanied with fewer up to 39°C and malaise lasting for 48 hours. On admission, one week after the disease exacerbation, physical examination revealed highly inflammatory, psoriatic plaques with gross, silver scaling localized mostly on patient’s lower legs (Fig. 1a and b). Moreover, multiple, smaller lesions were visible on patient’s back and chest (Fig. 1c). The patient did not complain of neither associated itch nor pain. The PASI score was 18.5 points. Treatment of chronic inflammatory disorders changed drastically during COVID-19 pandemic. Problems with drugs availability and irregular consultations with dermatologist caused many patients to suffer from exacerbations.1 Moreover, the pandemic triggered insecurity about the use of novel treatment modalities.1 Yet, it is important to emphasize that psoriatic patients may present higher risk of respiratory diseases because of systemic inflammation.2 Therefore, and due to the lack of data on safety of novel, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, concern on its impact on patients suffering from inflammatory diseases has been raised. Vaccination, in general, is an uncommon factor triggering psoriasis flares; nevertheless, the association of vaccination with the new development or exacerbation of this skin disease has been reported.3, 4 The available reports include mostly cases of psoriasis flare-ups after vaccination for influenza (H1N1), pneumococcal pneumonia and yellow fever.3-5 However, until now, there was no well-described association with novel mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Possible cutaneous reactions after COVID-19 vaccination were characterized recently in a registry-based study of 414 cases by McMahon et al.6 Among others, authors described cases of local site reactions, swelling, erythema, urticaria, erythromelalgia and flares of existing dermatologic disorders. Regarding the prevalence of psoriasis flare-ups, amid 414 cutaneous reactions, authors stated that it occurred only in two patients, which seems to be very rare. Moreover, there was no explicit description of skin lesions, nor its association with particular vaccination.6 Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, our case is the first, well-described example of psoriatic flare-up after COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT16B2b2 mRNA vaccine. The mechanisms responsible for psoriasis exacerbation after vaccination are yet to be understood. It is possible that similarly to influenza vaccines, it may be caused by both dysregulation of immune system due to viral components and vaccine adjuvants.3 Moreover, mRNA vaccines, like BCG or diphtheria, may cause a significant increase in IL-6 production and recruitment of Th17 cells, which play an important role in pathomechanism of psoriasis.3 Nevertheless, even though psoriasis flares are rare, because of extensive and rapid vaccination, medical professionals should pay close attention to possible adverse effects and counteract the worsening of patient’s clinical condition. No conflict of interest. No funding to declare.},

	abstract = {The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by a positive-stranded RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), belonging to the Coronaviridae family. This virus originated in Wuhan City, China, and became the cause of a multiwave pandemic that has killed 3.46 million people worldwide as of May 22, 2021. The havoc intensified with the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7; Alpha, B.1.351; Beta, P.1; Gamma, B.1.617; Delta, B.1.617.2; Delta-plus, B.1.525; Eta, and B.1.429; Epsilon etc.) due to mutations generated during replication. More variants may emerge to cause additional pandemic waves. The most promising approach for combating viruses and their emerging variants lies in prophylactic vaccines. Several vaccine candidates are being developed using various platforms, including nucleic acids, live attenuated virus, inactivated virus, viral vectors, and protein-based subunit vaccines. In this unprecedented time, 12 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 have been phased in following WHO approval, 184 are in the preclinical stage, and 100 are in the clinical development process. Many of them are directed to elicit neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein (S) to inhibit viral entry through the ACE-2 receptor of host cells. Inactivated vaccines, to the contrary, provide a wide range of viral antigens for immune activation. Being an intracellular pathogen, the cytotoxic CD8 + T Cell (CTL) response remains crucial for all viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and needs to be explored in detail. In this review, we try to describe and compare approved vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 that are currently being distributed either after phase III clinical trials or for emergency use. We discuss immune responses induced by various candidate vaccine formulations; their benefits, potential limitations, and effectiveness against variants; future challenges, such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE); and vaccine safety issues and their possible resolutions. Most of the current vaccines developed against SARS-CoV-2 are showing either promising or compromised efficacy against new variants. Multiple antigen-based vaccines (multivariant vaccines) should be developed on different platforms to tackle future variants. Alternatively, recombinant BCG, containing SARS-CoV-2 multiple antigens, as a live attenuated vaccine should be explored for long-term protection. Irrespective of their efficacy, all vaccines are efficient in providing protection from disease severity. We must insist on vaccine compliance for all age groups and work on vaccine hesitancy globally to achieve herd immunity and, eventually, to curb this pandemic.},

	abstract = {Despite of the rapid development of the vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), it will take several months to have enough doses and the proper infrastructure to vaccinate a good proportion of the world population. In this interim, the accessibility to the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) may mitigate the pandemic impact in some countries and the BCG vaccine offers significant advantages and flexibility in the way clinical vaccines are administered. BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against tuberculosis (TB) and many low-and lower-middle-income countries would likely have the infrastructure, and health care personnel sufficiently familiar with the conventional TB vaccine to mount full-scale efforts to administer novel BCG-based vaccine for COVID-19. This suggests the potential for BCG to overcome future barriers to vaccine roll-out in the countries where health systems are fragile and where the effects of this new coronavirus could be catastrophic. Many studies have reported cross-protective effects of the BCG vaccine toward non-tuberculosis related diseases. Mechanistically, this cross-protective effect of the BCG vaccine can be explained, in part, by trained immunity, a recently discovered program of innate immune memory, which is characterized by non-permanent epigenetic reprogramming of macrophages that leads to increased inflammatory cytokine production and consequently potent immune responses. In this review, we summarize recent work highlighting the potential use of BCG for the treatment respiratory infectious diseases and ongoing SARS-CoV-2 clinical trials. In situations where no other specific prophylactic tools are available, the BCG vaccine could be used as a potential adjuvant, to decrease sickness of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or to mitigate the effects of concurrent respiratory infections.},

Leading scientific minds have brought us a glimmer of hope with the development of multiple vaccines that are currently being distributed throughout the world. With the mass rollout of vaccination, both prevention of COVID-19 infection and reduction in morbidity and mortality can be achieved with hopes of ending the pandemic. Since February 27, 2021, three COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for emergency use: the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines and the most recently authorized single-dose Johnson and Johnson/Janssen adenovirus vector vaccine. Several other vaccines are in development or being distributed in other countries including those developed by Oxford-AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or AZD1222), Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Sputnik V), and the CanSinoBIO-Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (Convidicea or Ad5-nCoV). Through March 26, 2021, 526 million doses of vaccines have been distributed across the world.With mass vaccination rollout, lymphadenopathy ipsilateral to the injected deltoid muscle has become an important manifestation of an immune response to be aware of as it may present as a diagnostic dilemma on cancer imaging studies. We write this editorial as a public service message at a time where other countries are starting mass vaccination programs with the goal of preventing unnecessary nodal biopsies and alleviating patient concern.What Are the Side Effects of COVID-19 Vaccination?The most common COVID-19 vaccine side effects include local injection site pain, fever, chills, myalgias, headache and fatigue, with resolution usually in a few days (1,2). However, palpable lymphadenopathy commonly involving the axilla as an immune response to vaccination may present a clinical diagnostic dilemma especially in persons with a history of malignancy. Patients may be concerned regarding lymphadenopathy as a sign of malignancy, especially persons with a prior oncologic history. This anxiety will only increase in patients with lymphadenopathy as widespread rollouts of vaccination continue. In addition, lymphadenopathy may be found incidentally on imaging examinations, such as routine screening or oncologic surveillance examinations, presenting a diagnostic dilemma for radiologists (Figure).Images in a 69-year-old woman with a history of lung adenocarcinoma and recent left arm COVID-19 vaccination 3 days prior (first dose). (A) Axial images from chest CT show left axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (arrows). (B) Comparison chest CT images from 1 year prior show normal left axillary lymph nodes.Download as PowerPointOpen in Image Viewer How Common Is Vaccine-induced Axillary Lymphadenopathy?Although unilateral lymphadenopathy is a known side effect of vaccines, it is rarely reported with vaccines such as the bacillus Calmette–Guérin, influenza, and human papillomavirus vaccines (3–5). In a larger series examining 83 recipients of the influenza vaccine, four patients had unexpected fluorodeoxyglucose axillary node accumulations on imaging (5). In addition, lymph node uptake on nuclear medicine studies after vaccination has been shown by multiple studies.This is in contrast with the two-dose approved COVID-19 vaccines in the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which both have higher reported rates of axillary swelling compared with prior vaccines. This may be due to a higher immunogenic response to these mRNA vaccines, a type of vaccine that has not previously been approved for use. As a solicited adverse event in the Moderna clinical trials, axillary swelling or tenderness was reported in 11.6% of patients (5.0% placebo) after dose 1 and 16.0% (4.3% placebo) after dose 2 (1). While not solicited as an adverse event in the Pfizer trials, reports of lymphadenopathy from dose 1 through 30 days after dose 2 were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine group (64) versus the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination (2). The true incidence of postvaccination lymphadenopathy may be higher given axillary swelling was only reported as an unsolicited adverse event. Incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy visible at imaging is likely higher as not all patients have clinical symptoms.What Has Been Reported in the Literature So Far regarding COVID-19 Vaccine-related Lymphadenopathy?As of March 2021, at least 20 articles have been published illustrating or discussing COVID-19 vaccine–related lymphadenopathy, with 18 of these articles published in imaging journals. The earliest publications occurred in the field of breast imaging, where vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy was cited as a cause of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Other imaging subspecialities citing this side effect included nine articles in nuclear medicine, and one article in cardiothoracic imaging. In most publications so far, there has only been one or a very small number of patients reported on; one of the largest groups of patients reported on is 23 patients with axillary adenopathy who had undergone breast imaging (6). Journals which have published on this subject include Radiology, American Journal of Roentgenology, European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Clinical Nuclear Medicine, and Journal of the American College of Radiology (JACR). The majority of these articles reported lymphadenopathy as a side effect after the two-dose COVID-19 Pfizer or Moderna vaccines with two recent articles citing vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, currently only given as one dose in the United Kingdom, with the second dose planned for delayed administration. The location of the lymphadenopathy was primarily axillary with four articles reporting cervical lymphadenopathy. The lymphadenopathy can be visualized on multiple modalities with most published cases demonstrated on US, followed by PET, MRI, mammography, and CT.What Are the Current Imaging Guidelines Related to Vaccine-induced Axillary Lymphadenopathy?The Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) was the first imaging society to propose guidelines addressing axillary lymphadenopathy seen on imaging (7), with the Canadian Society of Breast Imaging (CSBI) endorsing the SBI recommendations. There have now been multiple publications suggesting guidelines for unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with focus on different modalities or oncologic subspecialities. We summarize these below divided in terms of different phases of care.Clinical HistoryVaccination dates, injection site/laterality, and vaccine type should be documented on patient intake forms or electronic medical record (7).Scheduling ExaminationsTo mitigate the diagnostic dilemma of vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy, the SBI recommends that patients should “consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccination or 4-6 weeks following the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccination” (7). This recommendation has been followed by a similar guideline published in Radiology from a multidisciplinary panel from oncologic centers, recommending for nonurgent indications such as routine surveillance, screening, or staging imaging to be scheduled prior to vaccination or to postpone imaging “at least 6 weeks after final vaccination dose” (8). McIntosh et al also (9) suggested performing PET/CT “at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination.” However, like other imaging examinations, if there is an urgent clinical indication such as treatment planning, active treatment monitoring, or assessment of new symptoms or potential complications, imaging should not be delayed, regardless of vaccination status.An additional strategy to mitigate confounding findings would be to administer COVID-19 vaccinations “on the side contralateral to the primary cancer” (8).Incidentally Detected Unilateral Lymphadenopathy on ImagingFor subclinical unilateral lymphadenopathy detected on imaging, vaccination history including injection site and date is now a key piece of clinical information to obtain. In cases of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography, the SBI recommends a BI-RADS 0 designation to bring the patient back for assessment of the ipsilateral breast and additional documentation of medical and vaccination history (7). After an otherwise negative diagnostic workup, and if a COVID-19 vaccine was given on the ipsilateral side in the past 4 weeks, a BI-RADS 3 (probably benign) assessment is then assigned with consideration for a short-term follow-up in 4–12 weeks after the second vaccination dose. If lymphadenopathy persists at follow-up, then consider a BI-RADS 4 (suspicious) assessment with biopsy to exclude malignancy. As these recommendations were first announced in January 2021 based on very early experience with COVID-19 vaccinations, they are necessarily meant to be conservative. In an update (March 9, 2021), the SBI notes that individual practices may wish to establish their own guidelines based on local expertise and resources.A different approach was suggested by a recent publication in JACR proposing use of “BI-RADS 2 benign” assessment with clinical follow-up for isolated unilateral lymphadenopathy after recent COVID-19 vaccination in the ipsilateral arm (10). This is consistent with the American College of Radiology BI-RADS recommendations for unilateral lymphadenopathy in the setting of a known inflammatory cause (10). In comparison with the more conservative SBI recommendations, this “pragmatic” approach would result in fewer follow-up examinations.In terms of management of clinically evident postvaccination lymphadenopathy, the multidisciplinary panel recommended “observing for at least 6 weeks until resolution before referring for diagnostic imaging evaluation or biopsy of the nodes” (8). The multidisciplinary panel also recommended “expectant management strategy without default follow-up imaging” in patients whom pretest probability of adenopathy is much more likely due to vaccination rather than malignancy. In higher-risk situations, either a short-term imaging follow-up with US and/or tissue diagnosis can be considered, especially in patients with a high-risk oncologic history (eg, ipsilateral breast or head/neck cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma) (8). The expected duration of postvaccination lymphadenopathy is not yet determined.What Are the Implications for Patients?Widespread patient education regarding vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy is needed, especially as this may be mistaken as a sign of malignancy. Imaging societies, clinicians, and news media outlets should spread awareness to educate the public regarding this side effect to minimize patient anxiety. When vaccines are administered, side effects such as axillary swelling should be highlighted and normalized as an immune response initiated by the vaccine. Patients should be aware of the best times to schedule routine imaging examinations with more infographics such as the SBI mammography recommendations for women receiving the COVID-19 vaccine being widely distributed. In patients with palpable lymphadenopathy after vaccination, another suggestion may be to proceed with clinical follow-up by a clinician or the patient themselves rather than imaging, resulting in cost-savings to the system. Care should also be taken to ensure clinical and/or imaging follow-up for those with lymphadenopathy that does not resolve, those with potentially causative malignancies (such as breast or head/neck cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma), and those with additional sites of lymphadenopathy.Disclosures of Conflicts of Interest: W.T.

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the rapidly spreading pandemic COVID-19 in the world. As an effective therapeutic strategy is not introduced yet and the rapid genetic variations in the virus, there is an emerging necessity to design, evaluate and apply effective new vaccines. An acceptable vaccine must elicit both humoral and cellular immune responses, must have the least side effects and the storage and transport systems should be available and affordable for all countries. These vaccines can be classified into different types: inactivated vaccines, live-attenuated virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, virus-like particles (VLPs), nucleic acid-based vaccines (DNA and RNA) and recombinant vector-based vaccines (replicating and non-replicating viral vector). According to the latest update of the WHO report on April 2nd, 2021, at least 85 vaccine candidates were being studied in clinical trial phases and 184 candidate vaccines were being evaluated in pre-clinical stages. In addition, studies have shown that other vaccines, including the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and the Plant-derived vaccine, may play a role in controlling pandemic COVID-19. Herein, we reviewed the different types of COVID-19 candidate vaccines that are currently being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trial phases along with advantages, disadvantages or adverse reactions, if any.},

There are now over 30 clinical trials evaluating if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cell responses is unknown. Here, we identify 8 novel BCG-derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13-derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG-derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding homologous SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG-derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG-derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. These findings provide an in vitro mechanism that may account, in part, for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers some protection from COVID-19.},

Currently, at least ten COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized under emergency authorization. However, these vaccines still face many challenges.Areas covered: This study reviews the concept and mechanisms of trained immunity induced by the Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine and identifies questions that should be answered before the BCG vaccine could be used to combat COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, we present for the first time the details of current BCG vaccine clinical trials, which are underway in various countries, to assess its effectiveness in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we discuss the challenges of COVID-19 vaccines and opportunities for the BCG vaccine. The literature was found by searching the PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), Web of Science (www.webofknowledge.com), Embase (https://www.embase.com), and CNKI (https://www.cnki.net/) databases. The date was set as the default parameter for each database.Expert opinion: The advantages of the BCG vaccine can compensate for the shortcomings of other COVID-19 vaccines. If the efficacy of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 is confirmed by these clinical trials, the BCG vaccine may be essential to resolve the challenges faced by COVID-19 vaccines.},

Some reports have demonstrated conflicting results. We performed a robust, ecologic analysis comparing COVID-19 related mortality (CRM) between strictly selected countries based on BCG vaccination program status utilizing publicly available databases and machine learning methods to define the association between active BCG vaccination programs and CRM. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CRM was lower for the majority of countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15 years (BCG15). CRM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. A higher total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CRM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15 years, but not other vaccination programs, and CRM. BCG vaccination programs continued to be associated with decreased CRM even for populations \&lt; 40 years old where CRM events are less frequent.},

Despite multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis being estimated to contribute up to one third of deaths from antimicrobial resistance globally, the minority of people with MDR tuberculosis have access to all-oral treatment regimens. Long, toxic regimens involving intravenous or intramuscular injections remain the mainstay in many low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) with high tuberculosis burdens. These regimens are costly for patients and the health system with low rates of adherence and treatment success. These conditions, coupled with COVID-19-related difficulties for people with tuberculosis to engage with care, are likely to foment drug resistance and threaten tuberculosis being treatable with a return to the preantibiotic era. To avoid further unacceptable morbidity and mortality, effective, person-centred strategies are urgently required to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis. There are many opportunities to learn from and integrate COVID-19 and tuberculosis strategies to deliver health interventions with broader benefits on prevention, case-detection, and care of COVID-19, tuberculosis, and other illnesses. COVID-19 has demonstrated what the scientific community can deliver with political will and funding. Large-scale, adaptive, randomised trials have provided rapid evidence on effective new COVID-19 treatments. Conversely, apart from bedaquiline and delamanid, novel drug development for tuberculosis has been stagnant for decades. With regards to prevention, multiple COVID-19 vaccines, which appear effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease, are being rolled out within a year of the pandemic onset. In contrast, the BCG vaccine is a century old and ineffective in adults, and the tuberculosis vaccine pipeline is strikingly sparse. However, the infrastructure, investment, supply chain, and uptake of COVID-19 vaccines represent an opportunity for future tuberculosis vaccination programmes, including the promising M72/AS01 E tuberculosis vaccine.7Tait DR Hatherill M Van Der Meeren O et al.Final analysis of a trial of M72/AS01 E vaccine to prevent tuberculosis.N Engl J Med. 2019; 381: 2429-2439Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar In addition, mRNA technology used to develop COVID vaccines has great potential to be reconfigured to other infections, including tuberculosis. In many settings, GeneXpert machines have been largely repurposed to test for SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic. However, as the Stop TB Partnership rightly notes: “Tuberculosis testing must continue”. Increased funding, logistics, training, staffing, transport systems, and use of GeneXpert could support enhanced tuberculosis diagnosis, early case detection, and resistance testing. More broadly, there might be opportunities to overcome silos in diagnostic facilities and develop enhanced multiplex platforms to simultaneously test for several priority diseases. Bilateral tuberculosis and COVID-19 case-finding and testing among people with respiratory symptoms or predisposing comorbidities, such as HIV and diabetes, are likely to be cost-effective and prepare health systems for a rapid response to future respiratory threats. Community-based and community-led responses that take diagnosis, care, and support to the doors of those affected have much potential. For example, people with respiratory symptoms and illness should be able to receive community-based contact tracing, directly observed therapy, and isolation and quarantine support from trusted friends, family, or neighbours.4Malik AA Safdar N Chandir S et al.Tuberculosis control and care in the era of COVID-19.Health Policy Plan. 2020; 35: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar Such strategies could improve distribution and use of appropriate personal protective equipment, reduce nosocomial transmission of communicable respiratory diseases, and improve the value-for-money of trained health-care worker time.

Governments and health systems should aim to integrate evidence-based public health messaging about tuberculosis, COVID-19, and other respiratory conditions. Moreover, achieving successful public health campaigns will be impossible without meaningful engagement with communities, civil-society representatives, and advocacy groups. This engagement is imperative to dispel myths, reduce stigma and fear, change health behaviour, and improve access to services. COVID-19, tuberculosis, and respiratory illnesses typify health inequality, are strongly associated with poverty, and share biosocial determinants, including undernutrition or malnutrition, ethnicity, and belonging to marginalised, underserved groups.9Pedrazzoli D Wingfield T Biosocial strategies to address the socioeconomic determinants and consequences of the TB and COVID-19 pandemics.Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2021; 104: 407-409Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 10Wingfield T Tovar MA Datta S Saunders MJ Evans CA Addressing social determinants to end tuberculosis.Lancet. 2018; 391: 1129-1132Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar Globally, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened impoverishment and nutrition for millions of vulnerable households, and lockdown and stay-at-home measures pose a risk of increased tuberculosis transmission, especially with concomitant overcrowding.

	abstract = {Introduction BCG vaccination modulates immune responses to unrelated pathogens. This off-target effect could reduce the impact of emerging pathogens. As a readily available, inexpensive intervention that has a well-established safety profile, BCG is a good candidate for protecting healthcare workers (HCWs) and other vulnerable groups against COVID-19. Methods and analysis This international multicentre phase III randomised controlled trial aims to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the incidence of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 at 6 months (co-primary outcomes) compared with no BCG vaccination. We plan to randomise 10 078 HCWs from Australia, The Netherlands, Spain, the UK and Brazil in a 1:1 ratio to BCG vaccination or no BCG (control group). The participants will be followed for 1 year with questionnaires and collection of blood samples. For any episode of illness, clinical details will be collected daily, and the participant will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The secondary objectives are to determine if BCG vaccination reduces the rate, incidence, and severity of any febrile or respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2), as well as work absenteeism. The safety of BCG vaccination in HCWs will also be evaluated. Immunological analyses will assess changes in the immune system following vaccination, and identify factors associated with susceptibility to or protection against SARS-CoV-2 and other infections. Ethics and dissemination Ethical and governance approval will be obtained from participating sites. Results will be published in peer-reviewed open-access journals. The final cleaned and locked database will be deposited in a data sharing repository archiving system. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04327206},

	abstract = {A number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine candidates have shown promising results, but substantial uncertainty remains regarding their effectiveness and global rollout. Boosting innate immunity with bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) or other live attenuated vaccines may also play a role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. BCG has long been known for its nonspecific beneficial effects that are most likely explained by epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming of innate immune cells, termed trained immunity. In this issue of the JCI, Rivas et al. add to these arguments by showing that BCG-vaccinated health care providers from a Los Angeles health care organization had lower rates of COVID-19 diagnoses and seropositivity compared with unvaccinated individuals. Prospective clinical trials are thus warranted to explore the effects of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. We posit that beyond COVID-19, vaccines such as BCG that elicit trained immunity may mitigate the impact of emerging pathogens in future pandemics.},

	abstract = {Several clinical trials are being conducted worldwide to investigate the protective effect of the bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG) vaccine against death in healthcare providers who are working directly with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Clinical studies suggested that certain live vaccines, particularly the BCG vaccine, could reduce the mortality due to other diseases caused by non-targeted pathogens, most probably through the nonspecific effects (heterologous effects). By the end of May 2020, the available information on the COVID-19 pandemic indicated the great effect of the BCG vaccine in reducing the number of COVID-19 death cases. The occurrence of death due to COVID-19 was found to be 21-fold lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination policy than in countries without such a policy, based on the medians of COVID-19 death case per 1 million of the population in these two groups of countries (p<0.001, MannWhitney test). Therefore, it can be concluded that the early establishment of a BCG vaccination policy in any country is a key element in reducing the number of COVID-19 and tuberculosis death cases.

	abstract = {Since December 2019, the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)- coronavirus (CoV)-2, responsible for COVID-19 and its worldwide spread led to devastating medical, economic and social consequences. Recently approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (SC2V) offer a new hope to end this crisis. Cancer patients (CPs) represent a group at higher risk of severe COVID-19 because of the underlying disease, mostly during the five years after cancer diagnosis and in case of active disease [[1]Williamson E.J. Walker A.J. Bhaskaran K. Bacon S. Bates C. Morton C.E. et al.Factors associated with COVID-19-related death using OpenSAFELY.Nature. 2020; 584: 430-436https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2521-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (3286) Google Scholar] but also because of their age and preexisting conditions [[2]Rüthrich M.M. Giessen-Jung C. Borgmann S. Classen A.Y. Dolff S. Grüner B. et al.COVID-19 in cancer patients: clinical characteristics and outcome—an analysis of the LEOSS registry.Ann Hematol. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00277-020-04328-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar]. Two mRNA-based SC2V have been recently approved by the EMA (BNT162b2, Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE; and mRNA-1273, Moderna Inc.) and consist of lipid-nanoparticles- encapsulated mRNA that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SSP). On cell penetration, mRNA will be translated into the SSP, where degraded peptides are presented by MHC molecules to trigger an antigen-specific cellular and humoural immune response (IR) against SSP epitopes. Of note, the viral mRNA is subsequently degraded, thus it cannot interfere significantly with the host genome nor persist overtime. Phase 3 clinical trials (CTs) evaluating these vaccines versus placebo demonstrated remarkable efficacy with more than 90% (95 and 94.1%, respectively) protection against COVID-19 development and a favourable safety profile [[3]Baden L.R. El Sahly H.M. Essink B. Kotloff K. Frey S. Novak R. et al.Efficacy and safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.N Engl J Med. 2020; : 1-14https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2035389Crossref Google Scholar,[4]Polack F.P. Thomas S.J. Kitchin N.

Although the efficiency of vaccination to prevent SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic infection and transmission was not robustly explored in these phase 3 CTs, there was a trend in a decrease in PCR positivity before the second injection in the vaccine group (0.1% versus 0.3%) [[3]Baden L.R. El Sahly H.M. Essink B. Kotloff K. Frey S. Novak R. et al.Efficacy and safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.N Engl J Med. 2020; : 1-14https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2035389Crossref Google Scholar]. Further studies are needed to address this question. In the BNT162b2 CT (Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE) only, 4% of patients in the vaccine group suffered of any malignancy. Metastatic solid tumour, leukaemia and lymphoma represented 0.2% of all patients. Although robust data on efficacy and safety in this category of patients are lacking and because none of these patients received immunosuppressive treatment such as chemotherapy [[3]Baden L.R. El Sahly H.M. Essink B. Kotloff K. Frey S. Novak R. et al.Efficacy and safety of the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.N Engl J Med. 2020; : 1-14https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2035389Crossref Google Scholar,[4]Polack F.P. Thomas S.J. Kitchin N.

The ability of CP to build a strong, durable anti-SARS-CoV-2 IR with these mRNA-based vaccines shall be investigated in future trials. Recently, the EMA has approved of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 codeveloped by AstraZeneca and Oxford University based on the results of 4 randomised CTs demonstrating an efficacy of ~60% with only mild local and systemic reactions [[5]Voysey M. Clemens S.A.C. Madhi S.A. Weckx L.Y. Folegatti P.M. Aley P.K. et al.Safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2: an interim analysis of four randomised controlled trials in Brazil, South Africa, and the UK.Lancet. 2021; 397: 99-111https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)32661-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2819) Google Scholar]. This vaccine is a replication-deficient simian adenovirus expressing full-length SSP used here as a vector for transfection of SSP nucleic acid sequence into host cells, which will express SSP without viral replication. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a “live” vaccine such as BCG. Of note, its efficacy in the elderly population could not be formally demonstrated because few patients in those trials were over 55 years old. However, COVID-19 protection is expected in these patients given that an IR against the SSP was generated in this age group. The vaccine can be used in adults aged >55 years as per EMA recommendation. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4, restore an efficient anti-tumor IR by blocking inhibitory synapses. Considering their mechanism of action and based on preclinical data, ICI are likely to enhance rather than diminish IR against vaccines. Although the susceptibility of immunotherapy-treated patients to infections has not been specifically investigated, immunosuppression is not expected with these treatments and efficient postvaccinal seroconversion was already demonstrated with influenza vaccines [[6]Bersanelli M. Controversies about COVID-19 and anticancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.Immunotherapy. 2020; 12: 269-273https://doi.org/10.2217/imt- 2020-0067Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar,[7]Bayle A.

However, CPs receiving steroids or cytokine blockers to manage immune-related side effects may not mount a robust IR against vaccines, but this aspect has not yet been evaluated. Patients with haematologic malignancies receiving B-cell-directed immunotherapies, typically CD19, CD20 or CD22-targeted therapies, may also be less responsive to SC2V [[8]Houot R. Levy R. Cartron G. Armand P. Could anti-CD20 therapy jeopardise the efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine?.Eur J Canc. 2020; 136: 4-6https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.06.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar]. In light of these data, the FITC (French society for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer) elaborated the following recommendations (summarised in Table 1) on the EMA-approved SC2Vs for CPs treated with immunotherapy:❖Healthcare workers caring for CPs treated with immunotherapy should receive SC2V to minimise virus transmission (based on data on influenza vaccine [[9]Frenzel E. Chemaly R.F. Ariza-Heredia E. Jiang Y. Shah D.P. Thomas G. et al.Association of increased influenza vaccination in health care workers with a reduction in nosocomial influenza infections in cancer patients.Am J Infect Contr. 2016; 44: 1016-1021https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2016.03.024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar]). Because it is not yet formally proven that the vaccine prevents transmission of the virus to others, we recommend to maintain social distancing and masking even after vaccination [[10]Garassino MC, Giesen N, Grivas P, Jordan K, Lucibello F, Mir O, et al. Esmo statements for vaccination against COVID-19 in patients with cancer (https://www.esmo.org/covid-19-and-cancer/covid-19-vaccination) [n.d].Google Scholar].❖Anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be made available broadly to CPs under immunotherapy but considered individually, notably in patients with known severe food, drug or excipient allergies.❖CPs receiving ICI alone or in combination with anti-angiogenics or intratumoral oncolytic virus should receive an approved SC2V at any time of their treatment.❖CPs treated with a combination of ICI and chemotherapy should be prioritised due to their immunocompromised condition. They shall ideally receive their first SC2V dose 3 weeks before starting their chemotherapy or in ongoing treatment conditions, as close as possible and before the next chemotherapy to improve its immunogenicity.❖CPs treated with B-cell-directed immunotherapies (monoclonal antibodies, bi-specific T-cell engagers or CAR-T cells) should ideally receive their first dose of vaccine 3 weeks before starting treatment (including conditioning regimen for CAR-T cells). For patients who have already received haematopoietic stem cell transplantation or a CAR-T cell therapy, we recommend starting vaccination at least 3 months after therapy to allow immune recovery and optimise vaccinal response.❖Patients in CTs should not be prevented from receiving SC2V and efforts are needed for CT protocols and sponsors to allow for concurrent vaccination. In phase I immunotherapy trials, patients should ideally receive a first vaccine dose at least 3 weeks before cycle 1 but should not receive any dose during the DLT period to avoid confusing unrelated adverse events.❖Close monitoring of CPs treated with immunotherapy and vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 should be performed through CTs and registries to assess potential adverse events, measure biological and clinical outcomes, and determine optimal protocols for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunisation, notably:•The capacity to build a strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 IR.•The impact of the sequence of vaccination/immunotherapy on the efficacy/safety of both vaccination and immunotherapy and potential interactions.Table 1FITC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in cancer patients treated with immunotherapy. Finally, continued research with CTs and registries should be encouraged to generate more data on vaccine efficacy/safety in immunotherapy-treated CPs. FITC's recommendations could be modified on availability of new data.},

	abstract = {For chapters 1 (Notes on use/Disclaimer), 3 (Funding), 4 (Scope and purpose of this guideline), 5 (Population and health questions covered by the guideline) and 6 (Targeted users of this guideline), see long version of the guideline. All documents are available in an up-to-date version on the following website: https://debm.charite.de Guideline text and recommendations This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. An existing systematic review and meta-analysis was updated, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. Recommendations [3–6] Treatments are usually categorized as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs)/COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., diclofenac, etoricoxib), conventional synthetic disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs; e.g., MTX), targeted synthetic disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (tsDMARDS; e.g., apremilast) and biological disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs; e.g., TNF-antagonists). Head-to-head trials allowing direct comparison between the different groups or between the individual drugs are extremely rare. Indirect comparisons, e.g., network meta-analyses, are limited by the low number of trials for psoriatic arthritis. See Table 3 for an overview of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on psoriatic arthritis. The role of NSAIDs is usually in the relief of symptoms of psoriatic arthritis for patients with mild and non-erosive articular as well as para-articular, entheseal involvement. Treatment of NSAIDs should be limited to the lowest required dosage for the shortest period as needed [8]. Methotrexate is recommended, taking the label, the efficacy on skin and peripheral joints, the safety profile and the available long-term experience in the treatment of rheumatic joint disorders into to account [8]. Biological DMARDs For inadequately responding patients after at least one synthetic DMARD, we recommend using biological DMARDs as monotherapy or in combination with synthetic DMARDs in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis with active joint involvement (PsA). Previously, guidelines have given a preference to TNF alpha antagonists over other bDMARDs. In the guideline group’s view, a preference for inhibitors of TNF treatments for PsA is no longer mandatory, since ustekinumab (enthesitis) and the IL-17A antibody treatments might be equally effective; however more data are needed for its real-life long-term efficacy, safety and co-medication. The treatment with a biological DMARD can be performed in monotherapy or in combination with a conventional synthetic DMARD. Considering the evidence on skin and joint involvement and the experience of the expert group, apremilast is primarily suggested for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant psoriatic arthritis with an inadequate response to at least one csDMARD, in whom biological treatments are not appropriate. Local injection of glucocorticoids can be recommended in patients with active mono- or oligoarthritis, dactylitis with enthesitis or tendosynovitis. Systemic usage of glucocorticoids should not be standard for treatment of psoriatic arthritis, but if needed, e.g., during flares, “systemic steroids at the lowest effective dose may be used with caution” [9]. Tapering of glucocorticoids should be done slowly and stepwise when feasible. A narrative review of the existing literature and an assessment of the approval status of psoriasis therapies for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis were conducted. Existing guidelines were consulted [10-12]. Likely due to an overlap in the pathophysiology and genetic background of psoriasis and Crohn’s disease, the risk of psoriasis patients developing Crohn’s disease is approximately two- to threefold higher compared to the general population [13, 14]. The IL-17A antibody secukinumab and the IL-17RA antibody brodalumab have failed in studies in Crohn’s disease, with some patients experiencing worsening of their disease during treatment [15, 16]. Cases of newly onset Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have been observed during treatment of psoriasis patients with IL-17 inhibitors. The observed signal is, however, low, and it is presently unclear if the rate exceeds the rate expected in a psoriasis population [17]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version.) In contrast, ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab are all targeted therapies approved not only for the treatment of psoriasis, but also for the treatment of Crohn’s disease and, in the case of adalimumab, infliximab and ustekinumab, ulcerative colitis; dosages may vary between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Notably, the anti-TNF fusion protein etanercept failed in clinical trials in Crohn’s disease [18]. There is an ongoing phase II/III clinical development program for the IL-23p19 inhibitors guselkumab and risankizumab in Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. In the case of risankizumab, positive clinical effects have been published for the induction and long term treatment of patients with Crohn’s disease [19, 20] and are supported by immunological findings in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn’s disease receiving the drug [21]. There are several published case reports on the successful use of guselkumab in patients with Crohn’s disease [22, 23]. Due to their intestinal side effect profile with a relatively frequent induction of abdominal pain, loose stools and diarrhea, fumarates should not be used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Severe gastrointestinal diseases are listed as contraindication in the prescription information of Fumaderm® and Skilarence®. Inhibition of PDE4 with apremilast has shown positive effects in a phase II trial with ulcerative colitis [24]. Methotrexate has limited efficacy in Crohn’s disease [25, 26] and probably even less in ulcerative colitis [27, 28], but there is a considerable body of experience and no signal for a worsening of these conditions. Acitretin may be considered neutral in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease and has been used in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease that developed psoriasiform lesions (including cases of so called paradoxical psoriasis) during treatment with TNF antagonist [29]. Ciclosporin (CsA) is frequently used in the treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis and has demonstrated long term outcomes similar to those of infliximab [30]. In patients with psoriasis and active IBD or a history of IBD, we recommend preferentially using approved targeted therapies with a documented efficacy in these conditions: Crohn’s disease: anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) and anti-IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). Ulcerative colitis: anti-TNF (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-IL-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). If these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice targeted treatment options in patients with psoriasis and IBD: Crohn’s disease: anti-IL-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) Ulcerative colitis: anti-IL-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) If these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice oral treatment options in patients with psoriasis and IBD: Crohn’s disease: methotrexate. Active ulcerative colitis: ciclosporin (preferred), apremilast (also possible). This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Some studies have studied the possible association of the use of systemic therapies for psoriasis and incident cancer (in patients without previous history of cancer). A systematic review of RCTs and observational studies exploring the risk of cancer in psoriasis patients treated with biologics described an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in those patients being treated with anti-TNFs. However, included studies lacked adjustment for highly relevant confounding factors such as prior phototherapy. Data on other cancers do not show a risk associated with exposure to drugs. However, the studies are likely to be underpowered to ascertain the risk of individual types of cancer [31]. Vaengebjerg et al. did not find increased risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on biologics compared with other systemic therapies [32]. There are also some studies describing the risk of cancer associated with systemic therapy for other immune-mediated disorders, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, other rheumatic disorders and inflammatory bowel disease. Results in these disorders might not be appropriately extrapolated to psoriasis patients, as psoriatic patients receive less immunosuppressive therapy (specially corticosteroids) and the associated disorders are different [33]. Most studies are reassuring and did not find a relationship between exposure to anti-TNFs and risk of incident cancer in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis [34]. Luo et al., analyzing data from nine cohorts, described an increased risk of cancer in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, which was not seen in patients receiving biologics. However, this increase was due to nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and included studies have not considered the likely effect of previous PUVA therapy [35]. Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) of TNF inhibitors contain information regarding the risk of lymphoma/leukemia. However, these are rare events and data supporting this association are conflicting. So far, no such association have been shown for psoriasis patients [31]. Few studies provide information that is relevant for answering this question. Regarding patients with precancerous conditions (data available only for cervical dysplasia), a study using routine data of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), describe that initiation of therapy with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bDMARD) was associated with an increased, but not statistically significant, risk of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer compared to initiation of a nonbiological (nb)DMARD [36]. Conversely, a review analyzing 238 women with RA and a history of cervical carcinoma in situ, no genital cancer was observed in the TNF inhibitor (TNFi)-treated group over a median of 5.2 years of follow-up compared with two incidents of genital cancer in the nbDMARD-treated group, during a median follow-up of 3.9 years [37]. A systematic review of studies of patients with a history of cancer and exposed to anti-TNF therapy assessing for the risk of the occurrence of new cancer or cancer re-occurrence compared to nbDMARDs, included nine studies with 11,679 patients. None of them were studies on psoriasis. The outcome measures were heterogeneous, with many studies focused on describing NMSC. Overall, the study did not find an increased risk of recurrence in patients treated with anti-TNFs compared to nbDMARDs [38]. A retrospective study, based on routine data, of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and a previous NMSC, described an increased risk of a second NMSC in patients treated with methotrexate that was higher with longer exposures. Anti-TNF use was also associated with an increased risk, mostly in a subgroup (patients with RA and concomitant use of methotrexate) [39]. Another systematic review analyzed the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with immune-mediated diseases exposed to immune-suppressive therapies. They included 16 observational studies with 11,702 participants after a cancer diagnosis and with 1,698 new or recurrent cases of cancer. Only one very small study, and not contributing to the final analysis, was focused on psoriasis patients. Overall, rates of cancer recurrence were similar among participants receiving anti-TNF therapy, immune-modulator therapy or no immunosuppression, but was higher among patients receiving combination immune suppression [40]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) For patients with recent malignancy we recommend topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band UVB)* and/or acitretin. *Except patients with a recent and/or high risk of cutaneous malignancy. In case of inadequate response to topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band UVB), and/or acitretin we suggest using MTX in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer. **For patients with history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, see background text. We suggest anti-TNF or ustekinumab can be used based on existing safety data on a case-by-case basis including discussion with cancer specialist. We suggest anti-IL17 or anti IL23 can be used in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer despite the lack of long-term experience based on pathophysiological considerations on a case-by-case basis including discussion with a cancer specialist. This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. Psoriasis is associated with a higher risk for psychiatric comorbidities including anxiety and depression while results on suicide ideation and suicide are more unclear [12, 41–44]. In general, interventions that are effective for psoriasis correspondingly also improve symptoms of depression. Clinical studies using adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab or fumarates for the treatment of psoriasis have shown that all these anti-inflammatory drugs not only improve psoriatic manifestations, but also symptoms of depression [43, 45–50]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Acitretin has been reported to be associated with depression in some case reports [51, 52]. However, more recent reviews of the literature conclude that except for very few cases of depression and suicidal ideation there are no convincing evidence-based data to support an association between acitretin and depression/suicidality [53, 54]. A formal review of retinoids (including acitretin and isotretinoin) carried out by the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2018 [55] concluded that it was not possible to identify a clear increase in the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in people taking oral retinoids compared to those that did not. However, the EMA decided to include a warning about the possible risk in the product information for oral retinoids, since PRAC noticed that severe skin disorders themselves increase the risk of psychiatric disorders [56]. Based on the above, the guideline group did not consider there to be sufficient evidence to specifically counsel against use of acitretin in those patients with mood disorders but, in common with all systemic therapies, clinicians should monitor for mood changes given that people with psoriasis are at increased risk of anxiety and depression. In two out of three phase III studies of efficacy and safety of brodalumab in patients with plaque psoriasis (AMAGINE 1–3) cases of suicide were reported (two patients in each of studies 1 and 2) [57, 58]. An expert opinion (2019) discussing these observed cases of suicide highlighted the following aspects [59]: Further review of the suicides by the Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment Review Board confirmed only three of the cases as suicides. All of them had underlying psychiatric disorders or stressors and all three suicides occurred at one center. Both symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased during treatment with brodalumab [58]. In the European SmPC, the reported suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide in patients treated with brodalumab was mentioned. However, it was also stated that a causal association between treatment with brodalumab and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. In the SmPC, it is recommended that risk and benefit of treatment with brodalumab should be carefully weighed for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. If a patient suffers from new or worsening symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior is identified, it was recommended to discontinue treatment with brodalumab [60]. Results from two phase III studies including patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (ESTEEM 1 and ESTEEM 2) with open-label extension for up to four years, showed that patient reported depression occurred in 1.4 % of patients treated with apremilast and in 0.5 % of receiving placebo. The incidence of depression did not increase over time. There was one suicide attempt, and no completed suicides with apremilast [61]. Similar results were achieved in an open-label extension study (for up to additional four years) of three phase III studies of patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA); 1.2 % in patients treated with apremilast and 0.8 % in patients receiving placebo. There were two suicide attempts, and no completed suicides with apremilast [62]. Post-marketing experience, including five cases of completed suicides, was reported and a new safety information was published for apremilast provided by Celgene in agreement with the EMA and the UK Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority in 2016 [63]. In here it was stated that evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggested a causal association between suicidal ideation and behavior with the use of apremilast. The SmPC and patient leaflet for apremilast was updated to add a warning about depression (common adverse reaction [≥ 1/100 to < 1/10]) and suicidal behavior and ideation (uncommon adverse reaction [≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100]) [64]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) A systematic review was conducted. Four prospective studies (Oxford level 2) and four retrospective studies (Oxford level 3) were included. For details, please refer to the Guideline Development Report and Appendix 5 of the Evidence Report. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Short-term treatment with methotrexate does not appear to have a negative effect on carbohydrate metabolism parameters in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis [65-67]. However, MTX should be administered with caution in the case of diabetes and obesity, due to the increased risk of hepatic fibrosis especially when the cumulative dose exceeds 1.5 g [68, 69]. Ciclosporin can increase insulin resistance, interfere with fatty acid metabolism favoring the development of dyslipidemia and the increase of serum uric acid [70]. The diabetogenic effect of CsA has been assumed to be related to inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [71], an effect that may be even more relevant in obese psoriatic patients. Acitretin effects on insulin resistance are not clearly established. There is no evidence that fumarates and apremilast could affect insulin resistance. Additionally, diabetes is not a contraindication for the use of apremilast or fumarates. For patients with renal impairment due to diabetic nephropathy, limitations apply of fumarates as stated in the SmPC. Clinically significant dyslipidemia has been rarely reported in patients receiving TNFα antagonists, but this is not a common issue in clinical practice [72]. Body weight gain could occur in patients treated with TNFα antagonists [73, 74]. In contrast, ustekinumab and IL-17 inhibitors usually do not increase body weight in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis [75, 76]. Apremilast has been shown to cause weight loss in clinical trials [76]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Finally, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis are candidate for interventions aimed to reduce their cardiovascular risk profile. Screening for cardiovascular risks including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia should be recommended for all psoriasis patients [12]. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight loss, should be recommended to obese patients. Indeed, it has been reported that a low-calorie diet inducing a moderate weight loss (i.e. 5 to 10 % of body weight) increases the responsiveness of obese patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to systemic treatments [77-80]. Moreover, body weight loss could also increase insulin sensitivity in obese patients with psoriasis. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Finally, it should be considered that diabetic nephropathy occurring in patients with psoriasis could reduce the clearance of any systemic treatments for psoriasis including MTX and CsA [81, 82]. Ciclosporin should be considered cautiously in patients with diabetes mellitus as significantly increased serum creatinine concentration could be observed [83]. This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. We suggest methotrexate as preferred first-line therapy in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease* if other patient characteristics do not preclude its use. In case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. We suggest anti-TNFs, ustekinumab, and IL-17 inhibitors as preferred targeted therapies in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease*. In case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. We suggest that methotrexate, acitretin and apremilast be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *In case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. We suggest that ustekinumab, inhibitors of IL-17 and of IL-23 be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *In case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. A narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. A number of risk factors that predispose one to chronic kidney disease (CKD) are especially prevalent in people with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, being treated with drugs that may impair kidney function. A UK population-based study suggests that the risk of CKD was increased in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, independent of these risk factors [92]. Thus, the optimal choice of systemic therapy in the context of CKD is likely to be a relatively common clinical scenario. This is supported by data from the Spanish long-term pharmacovigilance registry indicating that 13 % of the total cohort were categorized as having “chronic renal failure” [93]. Systemic therapies In summary, acitretin is not known to be nephrotoxic, and CKD (any stage) would not be predicted to markedly impact on drug disposition. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Apremilast has no known nephrotoxic potential. In the pivotal clinical trials there was no evidence for treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) related to renal function [64, 94]. In patients with mild to moderate impairment of kidney function, no dose adjustment of apremilast is necessary. When patients have severe impairment of kidney function (eGFR below 30 mL/min/1,73 m2 or CLcr < 30 mL/min) the dose of apremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Fumarates are known to be potentially nephrotoxic, and may rarely cause an irreversible, proximal renal tubular nephropathy with long-term use. Recent studies [95] of dimethyl fumarate (for MS) confirm proteinuria and reduction in eGFR to occur more commonly than placebo; German guidelines and the SmPC specify careful monitoring of serum creatinine, and treatment cessation in the event of significant change. In healthy individuals, fumarates are extensively metabolized by ubiquitous esterases, and so CKD would not be predicted to significantly impact on drug clearance [96, 97]. Ciclosporin has established nephrotoxic potential. Acute nephrotoxicity can occur within weeks of treatment initiation, is reversible, and arises due to dose-dependent vascular dysfunction, involving afferent arteriolar constriction that leads to increased vascular resistance and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. Tubular dysfunction may also occur, characterized by decreased magnesium re-absorption, decreased uric acid excretion, decreased potassium and hydrogen ion secretion, and distal tubular acidosis. Chronic nephrotoxicity [98, 99] is largely irreversible and is characterized by progressive arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular sclerosis. Chronic nephrotoxicity is more likely to occur with higher daily doses, larger cumulative doses and long-term therapy (more than 1–2 years). (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) Methotrexate is not generally considered nephrotoxic when used at low doses for inflammatory disease, although renal impairment is reported [100], and may be an under-recognized event. Methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate are mainly excreted through the kidneys, via glomerular filtration and active transport. Methotrexate clearance is therefore reduced (and thus risk of toxicity increased) in the context of CKD, depending on the stage. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) To date, nephrotoxicity has not been reported as an AE in relation to any groups of biologic agents (TNF antagonists, IL-17A/IL-17RA antagonists, IL-12/23p40 antagonists, and IL-23p19 antagonists). Clearance of biological therapies should not be affected in case of CKD (of any stage). Strong consensus, consensus-based We suggest acitretin*, apremilast*, fumarates*, methotrexate* may be used in psoriasis patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m²) *Careful dosing/dose adjustment may be needed; for apremilast if < 30 mL/min/1.73 m². A narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) With the exception of TNF antagonists, any of the standard or biologic treatments can be used in people with co-existing neurological disease. Although neurotoxicity is reported with CsA, and (rarely) with MTX, there is no evidence that those with pre-existing neurological disease are more at risk. The causal association between TNF antagonists and demyelination remains yet to be proven, although accumulating anecdotal reports, biological plausibility and expert consensus indicate that this class of drugs should be avoided in patients with a clear history of central demyelination. Given evidence for a genetic basis to multiple sclerosis (MS) [101], and that asymptomatic first-degree relatives may have morphological evidence of subclinical disease and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands (reviewed in [102]), it would seem prudent to use TNF antagonists with caution in this group too. Dimethyl fumarate is licensed for use in MS, and so may be a preferred first line option, however, surveillance monitoring of peripheral leukocyte counts is strongly recommended in order to minimize the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Ustekinumab and anti-IL-17 represent alternative treatment options. A systematic review on the treatment of psoriasis patients with viral hepatitis was conducted, which included 22 studies (Oxford level 3). For details, please refer to the Guideline Development Report and Appendix 7 of the Evidence Report. Screening Choice of treatment Depending on the individual health care setting and personal experience and training, we suggest consulting with a hepatologist to choose a systemic treatment for patients that have a positive anti-HBc with a neg. HBsAg/HBV-DNA test. We suggest, based on the common practice within the guideline group, acitretin, apremilast, fumarates, MTX, ustekinumab and the anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 antibodies as preferred systemic treatment options for this patient group. The available data published is insufficient to give strong recommendations for or against using the available antipsoriatic drugs in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant hepatitis B. An overview table in the long version of the guideline offers a summary of reported cases of reactivation. Reported cases need to be seen in correlation to approval date, especially with years and numbers of psoriasis patients with hepatitis exposed to the drug. For detailed information, see the Guideline Development Report. For some of the treatments, hepatitis is mentioned as a contraindication in the SmPC, although clinical practice, available case series or registry data may indicate a safety profile in line with treatments where this is not mentioned as a contraindication. This hold particularly true for methotrexate, where study data indicates at least no increase in liver fibrosis [103]. This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. This chapter will focus on screening and the next chapter on management in case of unclear tuberculosis (TB) status and/or suspicion of latent tuberculosis. The interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. It is not affected by prior BCG vaccination, but interpreting borderline results can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversion and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. The interferon gamma release assay does not allow for differentiation between active or latent TB [104]. A suppressed immune system (e.g., due to antipsoriatic medication) reduces the sensitivity of tests based on T cell responses. Only positive results will be convincing in that case, while negative results cannot rule out a TB infection. Negative results of a tuberculin skin test (TST) or IGRA of HIV-infected patients with a low CD4 count cannot rule out a TB infection. Whether to re-screen during, or after a longer interruption and resumption of, biologic therapy depends in large part on the patient’s medical history and clinical examination. The approach is not fundamentally different from that used for initial tuberculosis screening. Because there are no definite recommendations regarding the duration of a therapy interruption, a patient’s medical history is also decisive in this regard. In some centers, screening is usually repeated if therapy or care is interrupted for more than twelve months. This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, the details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. The interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. The interpretation of IGRA test results (especially borderline results) can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversions and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. In case of borderline results, repeating the test may be advisable [104]. Means to distinguish between active and latent TB commonly used in the guidelines group experts’ setting include medical history (exposure risk), signs and symptoms (e.g., current cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats), chest x-ray [105] and urinalysis (pyuria) [106-108]. For details of differential diagnosis of latent versus active TB, please see respective guidelines and reviews [104, 105, 109]. Data on reactivation risk with acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters and methotrexate and apremilast is scarce. Most published guidelines so far have not recommended TB screening for these drugs (except MTX and CsA) [110]. Screening before treatment for MTX is recommended in the SmPC. The sensitivity of IGRA and the tuberculin skin test (TST) may be influenced by conventional immunosuppressive treatments, so doing IGRA initially may be beneficial if a later switch, specially from MTX to other drug categories appears likely [111]. A higher risk of latent TB reactivation has been identified with (in descending order of risk): infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept. Cases of latent TB reactivation with ustekinumab have been reported in a long-term study of up to five years [112]. The risk of latent TB reactivation seems to be lowest during treatment with anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 targeted treatments [34, 113]. In a systematic review by Snast et al., 78 patients who developed active TB during biologic treatment were analyzed. Eighty percent of all cases were treated with adalimumab or infliximab, 12 % were treated with etanercept. No case of active TB was identified with the anti-interleukin-17 agents (ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab). However, the total patient exposure years for these at the time of analysis were much shorter than for the TNF antagonists. All patients in this review had initially been screened for TB. In the majority of cases, patients had no risk factors for primary TB or active TB and presented mostly with extra-pulmonary disease within the first six months of biologic therapy [114]. The long version of the guideline contains a table with an overview of the screening recommendations according to the SmPC and a presentation of the data on reports of reactivation under antipsoriatic treatments. The risk assessment may be biased due to the different time periods when the cases occurred. At the time of TNF alpha introduction, TBC screening was not always done, leading to higher numbers of patients with TB being exposed to the respective drugs. In addition to the reported cases of TB reactivation, pathophysiological considerations of the immune response to TB favor the group of anti-IL-17 and anti-IL-23 as treatment options. Interleukin 12 has been reported to play a role in the anti TB immune response. This chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. A systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the Guideline Development Report. Psoriasis commonly affects men and women planning conception and women who are pregnant, so understanding the risks of therapy during conception and pregnancy is crucial. Psoriasis is not known to have a significant impact on either male or female fertility. Although pregnancy has an unpredictable effect on psoriasis, limited evidence suggests that psoriasis usually improves; around 55 % improve during pregnancy, 25 % report no change, and 25 % worsen [115, 116]. Conversely in the post-partum period, psoriasis is more likely to flare; around 65 % worsen, 25 % demonstrate no change and 10 % improve. Maternal and fetal health outcomes are vital considerations when deciding on the optimal treatment for individuals with psoriasis who are planning conception or are pregnant. Although data are limited and not always consistent across studies [117], untreated severe psoriasis in the mother may be detrimental for fetal well-being and pregnancy outcomes, for example it has been shown to be associated with preterm birth and low birthweight babies [118, 119]. The risk of untreated psoriasis of the mother in pregnancy must therefore be weighed against any potential harm through drug exposure of the fetus. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) For further information on acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates and methotrexate see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. When providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug SmPC. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) All of the biologic agents that are currently licensed for psoriasis except certolizumab pegol contain a human IgG1 Fc region and are actively transported across the placenta via neonatal Fc receptors [120, 121]. Active placental transfer is thought to be very low during the first trimester when organogenesis takes place, hence the theoretical risk of teratogenicity of biologics is low. Active transfer can, however, occur at around 13 weeks’ gestation and increases significantly after 20 weeks’ gestation. This increasing exposure to biologics during the second and third trimesters is hypothesized to adversely affect fetal development, leading to potential risk of neonatal immunosuppression and greater risk of neonatal infections [122]. Biologic therapies typically disappear from an infant’s serum within the first six months of life. In contrast, certolizumab pegol is the only PEGylated humanized antigen-binding fragment of a TNF antagonist and it lacks a Fc domain [123]. Certolizumab pegol therefore does not bind to the human neonatal Fc receptor and it is not actively transferred across the placenta. This was underscored by an analysis of 31 pregnancies exposed to infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol (for inflammatory bowel disease), in which the median levels of infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol in the cord blood of infants compared with that of mother were 160 %, 153 %, and 3.9 %, respectively [124]. Infliximab and adalimumab could be detected in the infants for as long as six months. Post-marketing prospective pharmacokinetic research has confirmed no/minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol via the placenta (CRIB study, n = 16 [125]) and into breast milk (CRADLE study, n = 19 [126]). Population-based cohort studies that report pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to biologics during conception and/or pregnancy are limited to TNF antagonist exposure only [127-139] (see respective table in the Methods \& Evidence Report of the EuroGuidDerm version of the guideline). No evidence was identified on the use of IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-17 or IL-23p19 inhibitor biologics. Overall, the available studies identified no clear evidence of drug-specific harm to the fetus following TNF antagonist exposure with respect to congenital malformations, live births, pre-term births or neonatal infections [127-139]. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) When providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug SmPC. All biologic drugs currently licensed for psoriasis (with the exception of certolizumab pegol) are actively transferred to the fetus during the second and third trimester, and the impact of this on neonatal development and risk of infection (to both mother and baby) has not been adequately studied. (For further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) For paternal use of acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates, methotrexate and biologics see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. We recommend that men discontinue methotrexate three months before attempting conception*. *EMA recommends six months as a means of precaution; the practice of the guideline group differs from this.

	abstract = {Trials of BCG vaccination to prevent or reduce severity of COVID-19 are taking place in adults, some of whom have been previously vaccinated, but evidence of the beneficial, non-specific effects of BCG come largely from data on mortality in infants and young children, and from in-vitro and animal studies, after a first BCG vaccination. We assess all-cause mortality following a large BCG revaccination trial in Malawi.The Karonga Prevention trial was a population-based, double-blind, randomised controlled in Karonga District, northern Malawi, that enrolled participants between January, 1986, and November, 1989. The trial compared BCG (Glaxo-strain) revaccination versus placebo to prevent tuberculosis and leprosy. 46 889 individuals aged 3 months to 75 years were randomly assigned to receive BCG revaccination (n=23 528) or placebo (n=23 361). Here we report mortality since vaccination as recorded during active follow-up in northern areas of the district in 1991-94, and in a demographic surveillance follow-up in the southern area in 2002-18. 7389 individuals who received BCG (n=3746) or placebo (n=3643) lived in the northern follow-up areas, and 5616 individuals who received BCG (n=2798) or placebo (n=2818) lived in the southern area. Year of death or leaving the area were recorded for those not found. We used survival analysis to estimate all-cause mortality.Follow-up information was available for 3709 (99·0%) BCG recipients and 3612 (99·1%) placebo recipients in the northern areas, and 2449 (87·5%) BCG recipients and 2413 (85·6%) placebo recipients in the southern area. There was no difference in mortality between the BCG and placebo groups in either area, overall or by age group or sex. In the northern area, there were 129 deaths per 19 694 person-years at risk in the BCG group (6·6 deaths per 1000 person-years at risk [95% CI 5·5-7·8]) versus 133 deaths per 19 111 person-years at risk in the placebo group (7·0 deaths per 1000 person-years at risk [95% CI 5·9-8·2]; HR 0·94 [95% CI 0·74-1·20]; p=0·62). In the southern area, there were 241 deaths per 38 399 person-years at risk in the BCG group (6·3 deaths per 1000 person-years at risk [95% CI 5·5-7·1]) versus 230 deaths per 38 676 person-years at risk in the placebo group (5·9 deaths per 1000 person-years at risk [95% CI 5·2-6·8]; HR 1·06 [95% CI 0·88-1·27]; p=0·54).We found little evidence of any beneficial effect of BCG revaccination on all-cause mortality. The high proportion of deaths attributable to non-infectious causes beyond infancy, and the long time interval since BCG for most deaths, might obscure any benefits.British Leprosy Relief Association (LEPRA); Wellcome Trust.},

	abstract = {As summer turns to fall, clinicians' minds usually turn to the upcoming winter season and preparing for winter infections, particularly influenza. In 2020, though, we face a new and formidable foe: the severe acute respiratory syndrome novel coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although we hope that an effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 will soon be available, the distribution of an effective vaccine is not likely to occur soon, so it is especially appropriate to use the other tools already at our disposal to keep our patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) well. This includes making sure that our patients are in stable steroid-free remission, but also guaranteeing that they are updated regarding other vaccinations. We need to ensure that our patients are educated and encouraged to receive the influenza vaccination as well as vaccinations against pneumococcal infection. Discriminating coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) from influenza or other respiratory infections based on symptoms alone will be difficult and concomitant infection with SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens will likely increase morbidity and mortality. In this commentary, we outline the usefulness and rationale for existing practices related to vaccine-preventable illnesses in IBD, and discuss the emerging science and ethical challenges related to the highly anticipated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Many studies have evaluated the efficacy of vaccines among patients with IBD, including those on different immunomodulatory regimens (Table 1).1Melmed G.Y. Agarwal N. Frenck R.W. et al.Immunosuppression impairs response to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Am J Gastroenterol. 2010; 105: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,2Cullen G.

Korzenik J.R. et al.Serological response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Gut. 2012; 61: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar There are several important messages to be learned from these studies. First, vaccine efficacy may be blunted by immunomodulators, some biologics, and corticosteroids. However, a blunted response does not necessarily translate to vaccine inefficacy, and partial protection is better than none. Therefore, vaccines should not be withheld just because a patient is receiving immunosuppressive treatment for their IBD.3Melmed G.Y. Vaccinations while on thiopurines: some protection is better than none.Am J Gastroenterol. 2012; 107: 141-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar Second, vaccination while on immunosuppressive treatments may be associated with an accelerated waning of protective antibody titers.4Gisbert J.P. Villagrasa J.R. Rodriguez-Nogueiras A. et al.Kinetics of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen titers after hepatitis B vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. 2013; 19: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,5Cleveland N.K. Rodriquez D. Wichman A. et al.Many inflammatory bowel disease patients are not immune to measles or pertussis.Dig Dis Sci. 2016; 61: 2972-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar The implications of this phenomenon are not entirely clear, although for some infections like hepatitis B, it may be appropriate to assess postvaccination titers and consider additional booster dosing for low or absent titers.4Gisbert J.P. Villagrasa J.R. Rodriguez-Nogueiras A. et al.Kinetics of anti-hepatitis B surface antigen titers after hepatitis B vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. 2013; 19: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar Third, predictors of efficacy relevant to the general population are also applicable to those with IBD. These may include age, gender, body mass index, prior infection, immune compromise or senescence, and genetic polymorphisms.6Poland G.A. Influenza vaccine failure: failure to protect or failure to understand?.Expert Rev Vaccines. 2018; 17: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar Older patients are generally more vulnerable to infections, and the ability to mount a robust vaccine response tends to decrease with advancing age. Genetic polymorphisms may be associated with blunted vaccine responses, although it is unclear how these translate into differences in efficacy. Finally, the risk of an IBD relapse from vaccination is reassuringly negligible; published evidence to date does not suggest an association between any specific vaccine and exacerbation of IBD.Table 1Factors Impacting Vaccine FailureFactors Impacting Vaccine ResponseSpecific Relevance to Patients with Inflammatory Bowel DiseasePathogen factorsAntigenic drift/distance between vaccine and circulating strainsCo-infections—interferenceViral decoy mechanismsViral immune evasion mechanismsTheoretically increased risk for co-infection with other viruses (eg, influenza)Host factorsImmunocompromisedComorbiditiesAge/immunosenescenceObesityGenetic restrictionMedicationsNegative interferenceRole of humoral vs cellular immunityWaning immunityPreexisting infectionImmunologic interferenceImmunocompromised status from malnutrition and/or medicationsComorbidities as relevant (age, obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary morbidity)Medications (corticosteroids, immunomodulators, anti-TNF therapies)Waning immunity seen with other vaccinesVaccine factorsImproper administrationDifferences in immunogenicity (adjuvanted vs nonadjuvanted)Dosage and number of dosesTime between vaccination and development of immunityEgg-passage-induced antigenic changes in vaccineHandlingTemperature inactivationVaccine-vaccine interferencePotential need for alternate dosage/number of doses/timing of vaccinations based on concurrent medicationsStudy and study design factorsGeographyConfounding biasesEfficacy vs effectivenessPrevalence of infectionStudy designSpecificity of study outcomesYear of studyLaboratory assays usedIncubation period vs timing of immunizationEfficacy determined in trials unlikely to include patients with IBD/immunocompromisedEffectiveness for those with IBD will need to be studied in registries and postmarketing studiesIBD, inflammatory bowel disease; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.Adapted from the CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance.

Despite the variable effectiveness of the vaccine, influenza vaccination has been shown to decrease the signs and symptoms of the flu, decrease hospitalizations, decrease mortality in children and adults, prevent disease in those with chronic health conditions, protect women during and after pregnancy, decrease the severity of the flu among those with partial immunity, and provide herd immunity for those susceptible to infection.8Reed C.

Volume 2020.www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/pneumo/hcp/recommendations.htmlGoogle Scholar The international effort to deploy safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented, compressing vaccine development time from decades to 1–2 years. At the time of this writing, there are more than 90 animal studies of preclinical vaccines, and approximately 40 human vaccine studies in progress. This effort is remarkable, given that the sequence of the virus genome only became available in January 2020. A number of different approaches for developing vaccines that stimulate production of neutralizing antibodies against the viral receptor binding domain and other spike ‘S’ protein epitopes have been deployed, including:1.“Genetic” vaccines based on inoculation with viral RNA or DNA (Moderna/NIH – lipid-nanoparticle encapsulated mRNA: Pfizer/BioNTech/Fosua Pharma – 3 lipid-nanoparticle mRNAs).2.Nonreplicating (simian or human) viral vector vaccines in which viruses are engineered to carry coronavirus genes (CanSino Biologics – adenovirus type 5 vector: Gamaleya Research Institute – Adenovirus-based vector: Astra-Zeneca/University of Oxford – Simian ChAdOx1-S vector).3.Vaccines that contain whole or fragments of coronavirus proteins such as the Spike protein and often administered together with an adjuvant to enhance immune responses (none in phase III trials currently and a number in phase II trials).4.Inactivated virus-based vaccines (Sinovac: Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm; Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm). In addition to these novel approaches, a number of groups are looking to repurpose existing vaccines, the most high profile of which is the antituberculosis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine, currently in phase III studies (BRACE trial, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, Australia). The rationale for BCG includes intriguing epidemiologic data suggesting decreased mortality from COVID-19 in populations previously exposed to BCG.16Escobar L.E. Molina-Cruz A. Barillas-Mury C. BCG vaccine protection from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2020; 117: 17720-17726Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar Additional updated information about active phase III vaccine trials are available at www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines. Current vaccination regimens being studied in phase III include both single-dose approaches as well as 2-dose strategies that vary anywhere from 28 days to 56 days between doses. Human and animal data on both humoral and cellular immune responses to the vaccines have been promising and to date, safety signals have been reassuring.17Kaur S.P. Gupta V. COVID-19 Vaccine: a comprehensive status report.Virus Res. 2020; 288: 198114Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar Even if the vaccine studies show efficacy, many outstanding questions remain and some are particularly pertinent to the IBD community. Can we extrapolate efficacy and safety results from a generally healthy, mostly White, European ancestry population to groups who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, including immunocompromised, the elderly, and Black/Latinx populations? Furthermore, what are the effects of the vaccines in individuals who are elderly and who also have comorbidities such as IBD? Although safety signals have been reassuring to date, there have been media reports that the Astra Zeneca/Oxford study temporarily stopped recruitment owing to a case of transverse myelitis (although it is unclear whether this event was vaccine related or not18BBCCoronavirus: Oxford University vaccine trial paused after participant falls ill.www.bbc.com/news/world-54082192Google Scholar). It is unclear whether rare immune-mediated reactions such as immune complex–related phenomena or antibody-dependent enhancement (where vaccines induce binding antibodies that facilitate viral entry into cells instead of inducing neutralizing antibodies) are more common (or less common?) in patients with ongoing systemic inflammation, or in those receiving immunosuppressants. The complex lipid delivery systems necessary for delivering the mRNA (‘naked’ mRNA is rapidly degraded) in the Moderna and Pfizer studies can induce inflammatory responses often manifested by fever, and it is unclear whether these can also trigger further inflammatory responses. Nonreplicating viral vector vaccines require extremely large numbers (hundreds of millions) of viruses to be delivered and these types of inoculations have, in the past, resulted in cytokine storms.19Logunov D.Y. Dolzhikova I.V. Zubkova O.V. et al.Safety and immunogenicity of an rAd26 and rAd5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost COVID-19 vaccine in two formulations: two open, non-randomised phase 1/2 studies from Russia.Lancet. 2020; 396: e54-e55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar Will individuals treated with anticytokine therapies/immunocompromised be at increased (or decreased!) risk of these types of adverse events? It also remains unclear whether prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 will increase the likelihood of vaccine-related adverse events. Although these phenomena are relevant to the general population there are theoretic reasons, at least, suggesting that the IBD population may be at increased risk of some. IBD health care providers will therefore need vigilance for these types of reactions to inform vaccine-specific counseling to patients with IBD receiving a vaccine. Beyond safety it will, of course, be important to evaluate vaccine efficacy in patients with IBD given experience with other vaccines. How efficacious are the vaccines in the setting of systemic inflammation or immunotherapy? Will higher doses or additional boosters be needed, and how long will immunity last? Do distinct vaccine modalities induce differences in the degree and/or duration of immunity in patients with immune-mediated diseases? It is also still unknown which measure of humoral and cellular immune responses will best determine immunity and whether this will be different in patients with IBD. To answer these and questions about safety, it is vital that patients with IBD be closely monitored and studied in prospective cohorts with serial assessments after receiving any vaccine. There are a number of ethical considerations to the development and distribution of vaccinations for SARS-CoV-2 that must be considered and are similar to considerations for any new medical intervention and for any limited resource. First, as mentioned elsewhere in this article and specifically related to beneficence and nonmaleficence, because patients with immune conditions, including those with IBD, are excluded from the clinical trials of vaccine effectiveness and safety, extrapolation of the results from such trials will be necessary. Additional postmarketing studies will be necessary in such populations. Although our understanding of existing vaccines in patients with IBD will likely translate to these new vaccines, there will remain important studies that must occur. Second, is the ethical issue of justice and allocation of a scarce resource. We will need to grapple with decisions about who should receive the vaccines, which will likely have distribution and availability limitations initially. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has proffered a tiered approach (tier 1 high priority to tier 5 low priority) for vaccine distribution based on population categories and severity of the pandemic (low to very high severity).20Centers for Disease Control and PreventionAllocating \& targeting pandemic influenza vaccine. Volume 2020.www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/national-strategy/planning-guidance/index.htmlGoogle Scholar In their table, most health care workers are considered tier 1 and would receive the vaccine early for any degree of severity of the pandemic. Among patient types, pregnant women, infants, and toddlers are also considered tier 1 for all degrees of severity of the pandemic. Adults age 19–64 years old with high-risk conditions are tier 2 for low severity pandemic, but tier 3 or 4 for a moderate or a high or very high severity pandemic. It is likely that patients with IBD, despite the available data that suggest that they are not at high risk for adverse COVID-19 outcomes, will be stratified into the high-risk population. It is essential that we continue to educate our patients with IBD about their actual risks based on available and reassuring data.21Brenner E.J. Ungaro R.C. Gearry R.B. et al.Corticosteroids, but not TNF antagonists, are associated with adverse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases: results from an international registry.Gastroenterology. 2020; 159: 481-491 e3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar It is expected that there will be a great demand for the vaccines. As health care providers and physician leaders, it is our responsibility to manage the needs of our most at-risk patients and to distribute a limited resource equitably.22Persad G. Peek M.E. Emanuel E.J. Fairly prioritizing groups for access to COVID-19 vaccines.JAMA. 2020; 324: 1572Crossref Scopus (134) Google Scholar This mandate translates into an approach such that older patients with IBD, patients who are steroid dependent, and those with other established COVID-relevant comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, etc) should receive vaccines before other patients. Additional factors of consideration will be based on regional prevalence of COVID-19 and then, separately, ethnicity and race, recognizing the data of increased risk of infection and adverse outcomes in Black and Latinx populations. The risk of infection and adverse outcomes should be evaluated in conjunction with practical considerations of access to health care access. Nationally, organized updates and a national surveillance plan for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence will be needed, and in the absence of such organization, local and regional public health officials should guide distribution and provide regular updates. Finally, it is essential that we actively address misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccinations in general, and about the new SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. It is unfortunate that the scientific method and regulatory pathways for medical therapies and vaccines have become politicized and even discarded. We must promote reliable, scientifically rigorous information and consider the public health implications of an effectively vaccinated population. This process will include highlighting limitations to the datasets and advocating on behalf of our patients if there is insufficient information from which to draw conclusions. Specifically, we should proactively remind our patients that IBD is not caused or exacerbated by vaccinations, and that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will not have risk of causing COVID-19. The information about SARS-CoV-2 and IBD is evolving rapidly, but there remain many uncertainties and a pressing need for ongoing research. What is the true prevalence of anti–SARS-CoV-2 in the IBD population and how does that compare with non-IBD populations? A recent study from Germany demonstrated low SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in anticytokine-exposed patients with immune-mediated conditions, but the reasons for this finding are not known.23Simon D. Tascilar K. Kronke G. et al.Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving cytokine inhibitors have low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion.Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar Is this a result of medication-related protection from infection, a decrease in sustained immunity, a result of disease-associated biology, or due to increased sheltering? Will vaccine responses be different in patients with IBD, and what will be the effect of immune-modifying medications on seroconversion and durability of immunity after vaccination? Will the specific mechanism and dosing regimen of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine be important considerations for those on immune modifying therapies? After recovery from COVID-19, when can IBD patients restart medications and which medications would be the safest? Patients with IBD look to their gastroenterologists as the most reliable sources of accurate information regarding preventive vaccinations,24Yeung J.H. Goodman K.J. Fedorak R.N. Inadequate knowledge of immunization guidelines: a missed opportunity for preventing infection in immunocompromised IBD patients.Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. 2012; 18: 34-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar so we must ourselves be informed and educated to provide clear, unambiguous messages to our patients and the medical communities in which we practice. First, we should advise all patients with IBD, regardless of immunosuppression, to receive the inactivated influenza vaccination and pneumococcal immunization. We must also be ready to respond to antivaccination tropes and nonscientifically valid arguments against preventive immunizations. Second, we should stay apprised of the progress of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and anticipate that our patients will look to us for guidance. Thus far, we can reassure our patients that the major candidate vaccine mechanisms seem safe for most, if not all, patient populations, but that further clarity may be needed among those who are immunosuppressed. Although it is unlikely that any vaccine will be 100% effective against SARS-CoV-2 transmission, the most effective prevention strategy will include both vaccination and continued hygiene practices, including handwashing and judicious masking and physical distancing. Third, we must acknowledge that the initial demand for vaccines will exceed supply, and that a tiered approach to vaccine prioritization is ethically valid. This process will involve prioritizing health care workers as well as vulnerable populations with increased risk for COVID-19 complications. Finally, we should seek opportunities within the IBD community to enroll patients in postmarketing registries to better understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines on various IBD population profiles and establish evidence to further guide optimal vaccination strategies for our patients with IBD. Winter may be coming, but can spring be far behind?25Shelley P.B. Ode to the West Wind. Prometheus Unbound. C and J Ollier, London, England1820Google Scholar},

	abstract = {For nearly two decades, coronaviruses have caused many health and economic problems, while no effective commercial vaccine has yet been developed. It is worth mentioning that despite some mutations and recombination in SARS-CoV-2, its genotype is very close to the original strain from Wuhan, China. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine would be promising. It might be hypothesized that BCG vaccination is performed in high-risk populations before the commercialization of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, the development of an effective vaccine without considering the adverse immune reactions derived from antibody-dependent or cell-based immune enhancement may threaten vaccinated people\&amp;#039;s lives and long-term side effects must be considered. To this end, targeting of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in spike and not whole spike, glycolization of FC receptors, PD-1 blockers, CPPs, etc., are promising. Therefore, the subunit vaccines or RNA vaccines that encode the RBP segment of the spike are of interest. To enhance the vaccine efficacy, its co-delivery with an adjuvant has been recommended. Nanoparticles modulate immune response with higher efficiency than the soluble form of antigens and can be functionalized with the positively charged moieties and ligands of targeted cells, such as dendritic cells, to increase cellular uptake of the antigens and their presentation on the surface of immune cells. This research aimed to discuss the COVID-19 vaccines entering the clinical trial and their mode of action effective immunity against the virus and discusses their advantages compared to each other.},

	abstract = {Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new respiratory infectious disease, and there is no vaccine currently. Previous studies have found that BCG vaccination can provide extensive protection against respiratory infectious diseases.Herein, we obtained the latest data from the World Health Organization (WHO) as of August 12, 2020, and determined the relationship between three parameters (including the BCG vaccination coverage, human development index (HDI), and transmission classifications) and the incidence rate and mortality of COVID-19.The results showed that the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 in countries with BCG vaccination recommendation were significantly lower than these in countries without BCG vaccination recommendation, and countries with lower HDI have lower morbidity and mortality. In addition, we also found that the mode of virus transmission is also related to the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.Although our data supports the hypothesis that BCG vaccination is beneficial in reducing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, the data supporting this result may be inaccurate due to many confounders such as PCR testing rate, population characteristics, and protection strategies, the reliability of this result still needs to be verified by clinical trials.},

	abstract = {The “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” outbreak was first reported in December 2019 (China). Since then, this disease has rapidly spread across the globe and in March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Since the outbreak was first announced, our journal has extensively focused on the clinical features, outcomes, diagnosis, immunology, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its infectious agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We published our first COVID-19 article on 19 February, focusing for the first time on the clinical characteristics of 140 cases of human-to-human coronavirus transmission without any links to the Huanan Wet Market.2 Hypertension and diabetes were mentioned as risk factors and there was no increased prevalence in allergic patients. This early study reported that the main symptoms at hospital admission were fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%), and dyspnea (36.7%). Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were also reported as important signs and biomarkers for monitoring and severity of the patients.2 The prevalent eosinopenia in COVID-19 patients and the possible anti-viral role of eosinophils were further discussed in several following publications in Allergy.3, 4 Our second COVID-19 paper brought attention to the wide range of clinical manifestations of this disease, from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia as well as with only diarrhea.5 Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were severe. Another article, timely appearing in our journal, alerted the scientific community that even in experienced hands there was a 14.1% false-negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis in COVID-19 cases and were later diagnosed positive after repeated tests.6 A pediatric article was also published extensively analyzing 182 cases, and it was reported that children with COVID-19 showed a mild clinical course.7 Patients with pneumonia had a higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers compared to those without pneumonia. There were 43 allergic patients in this series, and there was no significant difference between allergic and nonallergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory, and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for disease and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not significantly influence the disease course of COVID-19 in children.7 The immunology of COVID-19 was extensively reviewed in two articles from leading experts with a comprehensive discussion of the tip of the iceberg in COVID-19 epidemiology, anti-viral response, antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, acute phase reactants, cytokine storm, and pathogenesis of tissue injury and severity.8, 9 Two studies timely reported the role of possible trained immunity in countries with a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination program and a relatively low COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rate.10, 11 In an extensive RNA sequencing analyses of SARS-CoV-2 receptor and their molecular partners revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells.12 Allergists, respiratory physicians, pediatricians, and other healthcare providers treating patients with allergic diseases are frequently in contact with patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2. Practical considerations and recommendations given by experts in the field of allergic diseases can provide useful recommendations for clinical daily work. Since the beginning of this current pandemic, our journal has disseminated clinical reports,2, 3, 5, 6, 13 statements on the urgent need for accuracy in designing and reporting clinical trials in COVID-19,14 preventive measures,10, 11, 15 and Position Statements elaborated by experts in the field in close collaboration with the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and the organization “Allergy and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA)”.16-25, 27 (keynote information in Table 1). A compendium answering 150 frequently encountered questions regarding COVID-19 and allergic diseases has been recently published by experts in their respective area (Figure 1).28 In addition, readers can put further questions regarding this “living” compendium electronically to the authors and their answers will be available through a new category in the journal's web page.29 Besides, EAACI in collaboration with ARIA, has provided recommendations on operational plans and practical procedures for ensuring optimal standards in the daily clinical care of patients with allergic diseases, while ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare workers.23 Intranasal corticosteroids (including nasal sprays) can be further applied in COVID-19 patients at the recommended dosages, and a cessation or interruption is not recommended Furthermore, a cessation or interruption of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) for both the subcutaneous route (SCIT) or sublingual route (SLIT) is not recommended in asymptomatic patients without suspicion for SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or contact to SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals or in other conditions as outlined Intranasal corticosteroids in allergic rhinitis in COVID-19-infected patients: An ARIA-EAACI statement21 Handling of allergen immunotherapy in the COVID-19 pandemic: An ARIA-EAACI statement22 Biologicals should be applied in type 2 inflammations (asthma, atopic dermatitis, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, chronic spontaneous urticaria) via self-application in noninfected patients In patient with an active SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment with biologicals should be paused and re-initiated after recovery and SARS-CoV-2 negativity of patients Less severe courses of COVID-19 in the pediatric population have been reported Similar to the adult age group, severe forms of asthma and immunodeficiencies are reported to be risk factors A sufficient control of symptoms in children with allergies, asthma and immunodeficiency in accordance with current guidelines is key in the current pandemic Drugs being used in different phases of COVID-19 disease seem to cause rare but potentially severe drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs) Most of these DHRs affect the skin and are nonimmediate The most important differential diagnosis of these DHRs is COVID-19-related exanthems An international survey revealed that experts in the field recommend that during the ongoing pandemic therapy strategies in line with current guidelines should be followed However, particular caution for the use of corticosteroids and immunomodulators in COVID-19-infected patients is expressed Recommendations on operational plans and procedures to maintain high standards in the daily clinical care of allergic patients while ensuring necessary safety in the current COVID-19 pandemic should be followed Nine different scenarios and topics are discussed Even though there has been a decrease in both infection rates and prevalence of COVID-19 in some parts of the world, in some countries the spread of COVID-19 has not been adequately controlled and the numbers are still rising. Epidemiologists have warned of possible subsequent waves until an effective vaccination becomes available. Until then, recommendations for different aspects of patient care are strictly needed, which underlines the importance of the COVID-19 series of publications in this journal. The recommendations provided in these articles will inform allergists and healthcare providers on the management and treatment of patients during this pandemic. It should be noted that these statements are based on current evidence and medical knowledge and there is a paucity of prospective clinical trials regarding some of the information provided in these documents. These clinical statements need to be regularly updated with incoming new clinical data.

	abstract = {A new strain of coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was first detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, China in late December 2019. To date, more than 1 million deaths and nearly 57 million confirmed cases have been recorded across 220 countries due to COVID-19, which is the greatest threat to global public health in our time. Although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses, i.e., SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS - CoV), no confirmed therapeutics are yet available against COVID-19, and governments, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are working together in search for effective drugs and vaccines. Repurposing of relevant therapies, developing vaccines, and using bioinformatics to identify potential drug targets are strongly in focus to combat COVID-19. This review deals with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its clinical symptoms in humans including the most recent updates on candidate drugs and vaccines. Potential drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone) and vaccines [mRNA-1273; measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)] in human clinical trials are discussed with their composition, dosage, mode of action, and possible release dates according to the trial register of US National Library of Medicines ( clinicaltrials.gov ), European Union ( clinicaltrialsregister.eu ), and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( chictr.org.cn ) website. Moreover, recent reports on in silico approaches like molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, network-based identification, and homology modeling are included, toward repurposing strategies for the use of already approved drugs against newly emerged pathogens. Limitations of effectiveness, side effects, and safety issues of each approach are also highlighted. This review should be useful for the researchers working to find out an effective strategy for defeating SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {From May 2020 to January 2021, we enrolled 1233 health care workers (HCW) from Danish Hospitals in a randomized trial evaluating whether Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) provides protection against COVID-19. Participants were randomized 1:1 to BCG vs saline and followed for 6 months. From December 2020, Covid-19 vaccines were offered to the HCW. In most cases, BCG vaccination results in a characteristic scar. Reactivation of the BCG scar has been described in children during viral infections and following influenza vaccination, but is mostly associated to Kawasaki's disease, a disease entity with pathogenesis likely similar to the child Covid-19 complication MIS-C: Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome. Reactivation of scars after neonatal BCG vaccination has recently been described in four women after Covid-19 mRNA vaccination. Two of our trial participants experienced reactivation of their novel BCG scars after receiving mRNA Covid-19 vaccination 6 to 8 months post-BCG.Two female HCW participants that had been randomly allocated to BCG in the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial, spontaneously reported itching and secretion at the BCG scar site after having received mRNA Covid-19 vaccination (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) 6 to 8 months following inclusion and BCG vaccination. One participant, who had a larger BCG skin reaction, noticed re-appearing symptoms after both the first and the second COVID-vaccine dose, while the other participant only noted symptoms after the second dose. Both had been BCG vaccinated during childhood, and no reactivation was noted in the older scars. No treatment was needed or provided.The reactivation of the BCG scar after receiving mRNA vaccine might have been caused by cross-reactivity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2. In both cases, the symptoms were bothersome, but self-limiting and left no sequelae. The risk of reactivation at the scar site is thus not a reason to avoid vaccination with either vaccine.},

Since December 2019, when this outbreak flared in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 cases have been continuously rising all over the world. Due to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 mutants, subsequent waves are flowing in a faster manner as compared to the primary wave, which is more contagious and causing higher mortality. Recently, India has emerged as the new epicenter of the second wave by mutants of SARS-CoV-2. After almost eighteen months of this outbreak, some COVID-19 dedicated therapeutics and vaccines are available, and a few are under trial, but the situation is still uncontrolled.Area covered This perspective article covers the repurposing of childhood vaccines like Bacille Calmette–Guerin (BCG), Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR), and Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), which are live attenuated vaccines and have been shown the protective effect through ‘trained immunity and ‘crossreactivity.'Expert opinion This perspective article has suggested that combinatorial use of these childhood vaccines might exert a better protective effect along with the available COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccines which could be considered as a preventive option against SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as its subsequent waves.},

	abstract = {After a century of controversies on its usefulness in protection against TB, underlying mechanisms of action, and benefits in various groups and geographical areas, the BCG vaccine is yet again a focus of global attention- this time due to the global COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent studies have shown that human CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells primed with a BCG-derived peptide developed high reactivity to its corresponding SARS-CoV-2-derived peptide. Furthermore, BCG vaccine has been shown to substantially increase interferon-gamma (IFN-g) production and its effects on CD4+ T-cells and these non-specific immune responses through adjuvant effect could be harnessed as cross protection against severe forms of COVID-19.The completion of ongoing BGG trials is important as they may shed light on the mechanisms underlying BCG-mediated immunity and could lead to improved efficacy, increased tolerance of treatment, and identification of other ways of combining BCG with other immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has been in use for 99 years, and is regarded as one of the oldest human vaccines known today. It is recommended primarily due to its effect in preventing the most severe forms of tuberculosis, including disseminated tuberculosis and meningeal tuberculosis in children; however, its efficacy in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis and TB reactivation in adults has been questioned. Several studies however have found that asides from its role in tuberculosis prevention, the BCG vaccine also has protective effects against a host of other viral infections in humans, an effect which has been termed: heterologous, non-specific or off-target.As we approach 100 years since the discovery of the BCG vaccine, we review the evidence of the non-specific protection offered by the vaccine against viral infections, discuss the possible mechanisms of action of these effects, highlight the implications these effects could have on vaccinology and summarize the recent epidemiological correlation between the vaccine and the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.Several epidemiological studies have established that BCG does reduce all-cause mortality in infants, and also the time of vaccination influences this effect significantly. This effect has been attributed to the protective effect of the vaccine in preventing unrelated viral infections during the neonatal period. Some of such viral infections that have been investigated include: herpes simplex virus (HSV), human Papilloma virus (HPV), yellow fever virus (YFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus type A (H1N1). These effects are thought to be mediated via induction of innate immune memory as well as heterologous lymphocytic activation. While epidemiological studies have suggested a correlation, the potential protection of the BCG vaccine against COVID-19 transmission and mortality rates is currently unclear. Ongoing clinical trials and further research may shed more light on the subject in the future.BCG is a multifaceted vaccine, with many numerous potential applications to vaccination strategies being employed for current and future viral infections. There however is a need for further studies into the immunologic mechanisms behind these non-specific effects, for these potentials to become reality, as we usher in the beginning of the second century since the vaccine's discovery.},

	abstract = {Background: Epidemiological studies show that BCG-vaccinated population seems to be more likely protected from COVID-19 infection, but WHO gave a stark warning on use of BCG vaccine without confirmed COVID-19 trials. The aim of the study is to evaluate whether TB vaccination, performed several years earlier, could confer protection against COVID-19. Methods: After the Ethical Committee authorization, professional orders were used to contact physicians with an online survey. Specialty, COVID-19 infection and previous BCG vaccination were recorded. Statistical data analysis was performed. Results: 1906 physicians answered the questionnaire, (M = 1068; F = 838; mean age 50.7 ± 13.3 years; range 24–87), more than half (1062; 55.7%) experienced BCG vaccination. Professional activity was recorded, and only 49 subjects (2.6%) of them were infected by SARS-CoV2. Among the group of infected people, asymptomatic form occurred in 12 subjects (24.5%); a pauci-symptomatic form in 24 subjects (49.0%); and a severe form (pneumonia and/or respiratory distress) in 13 (26.5%). Considering only the clinically relevant form of COVID-19, period prevalence was 2.2% (23/1062) in the vaccinated group and 1.7% (14/844) in the unvaccinated group (OR: 1.31, 95% C.I.: 0.68–2.63, p = 0.427). Conclusion: Our experience does not confirm the possible protective role of BCG vaccination, performed years earlier, against COVID-19. Although recent epidemiological studies point out in BCG-vaccinated population a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection, in our cohort of physicians no significant difference was found in terms of prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Our data underline the necessity to follow the WHO warning about the indiscriminate use of BCG vaccine, until clear evidence of protection by BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is fully demonstrated.},

In this study, we compared the mortality rate and recovery rate in countries with and without BCG vaccination policy. The data of mortality of COVID-19 was extracted from worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) on 26th July 2020. The data of countries where BCG vaccination is being done for all individuals is taken from BCG world atlas (http://www.bcgatlas.org/index.php), updated in 2017. BCG vaccination policy recommended countries are intervention group versus countries without BCG vaccination policies which are regarded as control group. Pooled analysis of countries with and without BCG vaccination policy revealed mortality rate of 1.31% (95%CI - 1.31% to 1.32%; I2 = 100%, p<0.01) and 3.25% (95%CI - 3.23% to 3.26%; I2 = 100%, p<0.01), respectively. The recovery rates in two country groups were found to be 72.60% (95%CI - 72.57% to 72.63%) and 55.94% (95%CI - 55.90% to 55.98%), respectively. 52 individuals need to be BCG vaccinated to prevent one death (NNT = 52). In BCG vaccination program countries, there is statistically and clinically significant less mortality (p<0.001) as compared to countries without BCG policy. Our findings corroborate the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may provide protection from COVID-19. High quality evidence from randomised controlled trials are required to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19.},

We strongly propose a national, coordinated approach for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), future pandemics and inter-pandemic periods in Australia. Our reflections represent those of the Australasian COVID-19 Trial (ASCOT)2 steering committee, as we have considered the challenges of conducting a clinical trial during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. To find effective therapeutic options for COVID-19, various approaches to coordination and prioritisation of clinical research have been taken globally. There are more than 3000 relevant RCTs now registered.3 Among these, the key practice-changing trials have been well coordinated, pragmatic, publicly supported by government, and funded by national research agencies.4 The standout examples are the Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy (RECOVERY) trial in the United Kingdom;5 the “Solidarity” clinical trial for COVID-19 treatments, run by the World Health Organization (WHO);6 the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) in the United States;7 and the Randomised, Embedded, Multi-factorial, Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (REMAP-CAP), which involves participating sites in 21 countries.8 In addition, the prior development of national clinical research networks and infrastructure for improved patient care has strengthened pandemic responsiveness. For example, the UK National Institute for Health Research, with a hospital-based trial infrastructure of clinical research units, was recruiting > 2000 patients per day to RCTs before COVID-19.9 When COVID-19 trials were prioritised in the UK, the existing infrastructure was ready to support pragmatic studies such as RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP. Almost 40 000 participants have been randomised in RECOVERY,5 and the UK has been the best recruiting nation globally for REMAP-CAP (with > 4400 of > 6000 participants recruited).8 Through an open letter from the UK’s Chief Medical Officers, RECOVERY was prioritised by the UK National Health Service as the preferred clinical trial at all its hospitals.10 Similarly, the Solidarity trial has been recommended by the WHO and implemented in > 30 countries. REMAP-CAP had a global intensive care unit network predating the pandemic, with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia and philanthropic funding, and was rapidly adapted to incorporate therapeutic options for COVID-19. The ACTT and the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV)11 partnership have been sponsored and funded by the US National Institutes of Health, with coordination for study sites within and outside the US, leveraging a well established network for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) trials known as the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials.12 Minimisation of regulatory requirements, facilitating rapid ethics and governance approvals and swift commencement of clinical trials, meant that these nationally or internationally coordinated trials have quickly evaluated repurposed therapeutic agents for COVID-19 for both efficacy and futility. Dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality in RECOVERY13 and hydrocortisone was beneficial in critically ill patients in REMAP-CAP;14 remdesivir reduced the time to clinical recovery in patients receiving oxygen with pneumonitis in ACTT-1;15 and interferon, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir–ritonavir were not beneficial in RECOVERY and the Solidarity trial.16-18 More recently, RECOVERY19 and REMAP-CAP20 have conclusively determined the benefit of tociluzimab, after six smaller trials found it to have no benefit. Unlike the UK and parts of the US response, there has been little central coordination in Australia for the prioritisation and funding of trials. Nor was there a nationally resourced and coordinated trials infrastructure in existence before the COVID-19 pandemic. The NHMRC did invest in a pandemic preparedness Centre of Research Excellence, which was awarded to the Australian Partnership for Preparedness Research on Infectious Disease Emergencies (APPRISE) in 2016.21 APPRISE has supported REMAP-CAP and provided seed funding to ASCOT. The Medical Research Future Fund (MRFF) has had two calls for clinical trials, in the first round awarding $6.8 million to seven clinical trials,22 which we estimate to have enrolled < 10 patients with COVID-19, and subsequently $7.3 million to nine research teams to develop promising antiviral therapies with a pathway to clinical trials. The first MRFF round opened for applications on 23 March 2020, with results publicly announced on 2 June 2020, by which time the first wave of COVID-19 in Australia had receded. Over $48 million of MRFF funding has now been awarded to 43 projects, of which at least eight are phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 therapeutics.23 There have been an additional 30 phase 3 clinical trials registered in Australia. There are benefits in the distributed approach to clinical trials. Competition for funding promotes high quality science. Several studies that provide similar results may improve confidence in the findings. Smaller studies may be more nimble and lower incidence settings better suited to phase 1 or 2 trials that provide important information to determine whether candidate drugs should progress to larger trials. However, there are also downsides to having multiple competing studies. Many research groups duplicate efforts in independently establishing trial infrastructure, including protocols, electronic databases, trial staff and trial committees. There can also be a burden on patients who may be approached about multiple studies. Ultimately, there is a substantial risk that each trial will end up underpowered to answer clinically relevant questions. The success of RECOVERY and REMAP-CAP to conduct and complete practice changing trials is instructive. These platform trials have been able to rapidly adapt, incorporate new therapeutic modalities, and answer questions of critical importance. Phase 1 or 2 trials are important for progressing the pipeline of potentially effective therapeutics, but in an emerging pandemic, the importance of coordinated investment in definitive phase 3 trials cannot be underestimated. There are some risks in centralising resources into a small number of platforms. Poor design or trial conduct in one of these platform trials could be more detrimental compared with spreading this research across a broader number of trials. There may be fewer opportunities for involvement of researchers outside of these platforms. These risks may be mitigated by encouraging coordinated involvement of multiple groups with trials and content expertise, and ensuring there is a mix of early, mid and senior researchers. Two critical factors have made it extremely challenging to run therapeutic COVID-19 trials in Australia. First, the unpredictability of the pandemic, and the small number of patients in Australia compared with other countries, has made patient recruitment difficult. Second, the swift accrual of patients and communication of results in overseas studies has resulted in the need to rapidly change protocols and drop interventions for which equipoise no longer existed. While these factors were beyond the control of clinical trialists, broader concerns in the Australian trial landscape are amenable to change. Funding, ethical and governance approval processes for clinical trials in a pandemic need to be in place in advance. By the time funding for COVID-19 trials was available through national schemes, the first and second waves had passed. Because of the lag time between trial conceptualisation and approval, pre-existing infrastructure is required to enable trials to be operational early in a pandemic. For example, REMAP-CAP had been funded by the NHMRC for > 2 years and operational for severe community-acquired pneumonia in intensive care units. In the absence of nationally coordinated funding, philanthropy has played an important role in quickly supporting trials such as ASCOT, the BCG Vaccination to Reduce the Impact of COVID-19 in Healthcare Workers (BRACE) trial,24 and REMAP-CAP. While we have a National Mutual Acceptance scheme for ethical approval of multicentre clinical trials in Australia, the requirement for governance approvals at each individual site creates substantial delays and critical roadblocks. While this would have been most helpful early on, developing a pathway to prioritise clinical research and prepare for future pandemics remains an urgent need. There should be a scientific discussion at a national level to prioritise, support and coordinate a limited number of clinical trials, reducing the burden on patients, health systems and funders. Furthermore, we recommend that a national pandemic clinical trials prioritisation panel be formed to advise the NHMRC, MRFF, chief health officers and National Cabinet. Its key role would be to establish a streamlined approach to funding prioritised trial platforms, consider how to integrate applications for new trials with established trial platforms, and establish pathways for rapid ethical and governance approval of protocols in the context of a pandemic and advise on any gaps in research.

	abstract = {As the world battles the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wading through the deluge of published COVID-19 research has become a challenge for clinicians. Despite a strong push for the practice of evidence-based medicine over the past decades, a search of COVID-19 literature in recent months paints a different picture. The use of hydroxychloroquine has been the ‘poster child’ for the importance of conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs), initially showing promise in uncontrolled studies [[1]Gautret P. Lagier J.C. Parola P. Hoang V.T. Meddeb L. Mailhe M. et al.Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2020; 56: 105949Crossref PubMed Scopus (3497) Google Scholar] and even being recommended by governmental leaders, only to later show no benefit in RCTs [[2]Tang W. Cao Z. Han M. Wang Z. Chen J. Sun W. et al.Hydroxychloroquine in patients with mainly mild to moderate coronavirus disease 2019: open label, randomised controlled trial.BMJ. 2020; 369: m1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar]. Similarly, many observational studies have reported on risk factors for COVID-19. A recent genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) has implicated that blood group A patients had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 than other blood types [[3]Ellinghaus D. Degenhardt F. Bujanda L. Buti M. Albillos A. Invernizzi P. et al.Genomewide association study of severe Covid-19 with respiratory failure.N Engl J Med. 2020; Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar], while other studies have found associations between vitamin D levels/latitude, and Bacille de Calmette et Guérin (BCG) vaccine and mortality to COVID-19 [[4]Rhodes J.M. Subramanian S. Laird E. Kenny R.A. Letter: low population mortality from COVID-19 in countries south of latitude 35 degrees north supports vitamin D as a factor determining severity – authors’ reply.Aliment Pharmacol Ther. 2020; Google Scholar]. Based on the results of these studies, shall we tell our blood group A patients to stay home or tell everyone to take vitamin D or get vaccinated with BCG? What are the mechanisms underlying these relationships? Although blood group antigens are known to play a role in infections, the results of the recent GWAS study may have been influenced by the control group comprising blood donors and the lack of adjustment for comorbidities [[5]Worldometer COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. 2020https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Date accessed: June 16, 2020Google Scholar]. Low vitamin D levels have often been associated with a higher risk of infections, but vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to prevent respiratory infections among adults with low vitamin D levels [[6]Camargo C.A. Sluyter J. Stewart A.W. Khaw K.T. CLawes C.M.M. Toop L. et al.Effect of monthly high-dose vitamin d supplementation on acute respiratory infections in older adults: a randomized controlled trial.Clin Infect Dis. 2020; 71: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar]. The BCG vaccine is thought to provide broad protection against other infections, but a recent study showed no difference in rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among vaccinated or unvaccinated adults [[7]Hamiel U. Kozer E. Youngster I. SARS-CoV-2 rates in BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated young adults.JAMA. 2020; Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar]. Overall, evidence supporting a causal relationship between blood types, vitamin D and BCG vaccine and COVID-19 risk are scant. The ‘big data’ and ‘real-world data’ movements have gained an increasing foothold in the pages of high-impact journals during the pandemic, but it is important to remember that correlation does not equal causation. To further demonstrate our point, we studied the correlation between the global ranking of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and the ranking of COVID-19 cases by country (Fig. 1). A ranking of countries based on the highest total number COVID-19 cases was calculated on 16 June 2020 based on data from the open-source ‘World-O-Meter’ online data repository [[5]Worldometer COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. 2020https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/Date accessed: June 16, 2020Google Scholar]. The FIFA ranking is a point-based system derived by adding points a national football team gains from playing international matches over the period of the last 4 years. Points are given for the outcome of the match, the importance of the match and the strength of the opposing team. We found a strong positive correlation between a country's FIFA ranking and their COVID-19 ranking (R2 = 0.40, p < 0.0001). This association was stronger than those of the prevalence of diabetes or obesity with COVID-19 risk (data not shown). Indeed, multiple football players in the Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, etc., have been reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. Does this mean that people who are skilled in playing football are at increased risk of catching SARS-CoV-2 or of spreading it? Or does COVID-19 make you a better football player? This is unlikely to be the correct conclusion to draw from these findings. However, there might be alternative explanations. The mass gatherings at football stadiums early in the pandemic may have contributed to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 or the cross-border travel of the supporters during the UEFA Champions League may have spread it to multiple European countries. Or is it possible that SARS-CoV-2 spreads among the guests in the football pubs where the supporters got drunk without social distancing and face coverings? These latter explanations appear more reasonable than the former, but no matter how strong correlation does not equal causation. While much of the published COVID-19 observational research has been fuelled by genuine scientific curiosity, we must not let our desperate effort to identify at-risk populations and effective treatments erase our appreciation of the well-established hierarchy of evidence. Instead, we should not forget that outcomes of observational studies are only hypothesis forming, allowing closer examination of the situation to identify whether a true causation can be established between the two variables.

Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections as well as of reported transcriptomic alterations in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that mimic viral infections by, consistent with the present concept of trained immunity, upregulation of antiviral defense response, and oppose viral infections by, inconsistent with the concept, downregulation of myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights argue against possible indiscriminate use of the vaccine and activated innate immune response associated safety concerns in COVID-19, in that order.},

	abstract = {The development of new specific vaccines against COVID-19 has occurred as the US program name promised, at “warp speed,” and emergency use authorization has led to vaccine rollout around the world. However, the emergence of new more contagious variants combined with limited vaccine supply has created increased urgency to vaccinate as many people as possible, spurring an international debate about the wisdom of abandoning or delaying currently mandated second dose “boosts” [[1]Mahase E. Covid-19: order to reschedule and delay second vaccine dose is "totally unfair," says BMA.BMJ. 2020; 371: m4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,[2]https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/06/john-p-moore-how-do-you-take-your-vaccine-one-lump-or-two/.Google Scholar]. Vaccination is thought to work by generating short-lived antigen-specific cells, some of which then become memory cells with capacity for accelerated expansion upon re-exposure to the same vaccine antigen. Thus, most vaccinations require one or more “boosts” to reach a level of memory cells needed to provide protection against infection. Vaccination schedules are designed around specific trials and regimens, and the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines have been developed with a booster dose scheduled a certain time after the initial prime. Economic and logistical considerations have motivated studies to assess one-dose compared to two-dose vaccines, and at least one ‘one-dose’ COVID-19 vaccine is under development. The current push for single dose vaccination has been driven by fear of the rapidly expanding pandemic and with the guess that the immunogenicity of a single dose vaccine and resulting immunity might provide an adequate level of efficacy. As data is being collected on the potential effectiveness of using only the first half of authorized two-dose vaccines, the global urgency to ‘do something now’ has taken us into realm of the immunological unknown: multiple countries already have initiated single-dose regimens (by design in the UK, possibly by default in the US due to newly-discovered gaps in second-dose stockpiles). The classic paradigm for vaccine efficacy is the induction of long-lived antigen-specific adaptive immune responses, in this case through use of a COVID-specific second vaccination dose. But is there a middle way between that approach—which may be logistically infeasible for the foreseeable future—and nothing? We believe that the concept of heterologous immunity provides a scientifically sound third option. Current licensed vaccines could potentially have non-specific beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease course through a variety of mechanisms including boosting of trained immunity [[3]Sohrabi Y. Dos Santos J.C. Dorenkamp M. et al.Trained immunity as a novel approach against COVID-19 with a focus on Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine: mechanisms, challenges and perspectives.Clin Transl Immunology. 2020; 9: e1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar] or increased natural killer cell function and enhanced production of interferon gamma [[4]Long B.R. Michaelsson J. Loo C.P. et al.Elevated frequency of gamma interferon-producing NK cells in healthy adults vaccinated against influenza virus.Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2008; 15: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar]. There is a growing body of evidence which suggests that unrelated vaccines can diminish COVID-19 disease [[5]Chumakov K. Benn C.S. Aaby P. Kottilil S. Gallo R. Can existing live vaccines prevent COVID-19?.Science. 2020; 368: 1187-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar]. Much attention has focused on the use of the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which provides cross-protection against related and unrelated pathogens through boosting natural and innate immunity by epigenetic reprogramming or “training” of innate immune cells [[6]Cirovic B. de Bree L.C.J. Groh L. et al.BCG vaccination in humans elicits trained immunity via the hematopoietic progenitor compartment.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; 28: 322-334.e5Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar]. The BCG vaccine can also independently alter adaptive immune responses to unrelated pathogens and antigens through cross-reactivity and bystander activation. During bystander activation, adaptive immune cells with weak receptor binding of the secondary antigen or no co-stimulation are activated due to signals from an ongoing immune response. These signals may include cytokines which activate T-cells and secondarily increase numbers of unrelated plasma cells. While prospective trials of BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 disease are ongoing, an interesting unrelated study initiated in the pre-COVID era that tested whether BCG vaccination in the elderly protected against infections, has published interim results. This phase 3 randomized clinical trial, called ‘ACTIVATE’, showed protection against respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin, [[7]Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J. Tsilika M. Moorlag S. et al.Activate: randomized clinical trial of BCG vaccination against infection in the elderly.Cell. 2020; 183: 315-323.e9Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar] leading to a reasonable chance, albeit still speculative, that BCG vaccination may also reduce COVID-19 morbidity, [[8]Noval Rivas M. Ebinger J.E. Wu M. et al.BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers.J Clin Invest. 2020; Google Scholar] although that was not formally tested in the ACTIVATE trial. Other vaccines, such as OPV or IAV are also potential agents to protect against COVID-19, [[5]Chumakov K. Benn C.S. Aaby P. Kottilil S. Gallo R. Can existing live vaccines prevent COVID-19?.Science. 2020; 368: 1187-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar] and the use of additional non-specific vaccines are being explored [[9]Marin-Hernandez D. Hupert N. Nixon D.F. The Immunologists' guide to pandemic preparedness.Trends Immunol. 2020; PubMed Google Scholar]. It may turn out that the type of non-specific vaccine used for this purpose is less important than which adjuvant (typically an inert ingredient designed to boost immune reaction to the shot) it contains. Adjuvants have been used in most vaccines and they come in different forms with different modes of action [[10]O'Hagan D.T. Ott G.S. De Gregorio E. Seubert A. The mechanism of action of MF59 - an innately attractive adjuvant formulation.Vaccine. 2012; 30: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar]. They are not normally used outside of vaccine formulation, although in oncology and immunotherapy treatments, novel pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-adjuvants are being trialed as immunogenetic augmenters. We propose that non-specific vaccination could be undertaken to immunologically boost the response to COVID-specific vaccines. Put plainly, this could be as anodyne as recommending that populations worldwide “catch up” on recommended non-COVID-19 vaccines one month after their COVID jab. Such “heterologous vaccine boosting” (HVB) should only be considered if an indicated second COVID-19 vaccine specific boost is not available. Had we the luxury of time, careful pre-clinical studies to investigate the viability and effect of HVB would be in order, but animal model studies could quickly test this hypothesis. Given the urgency of the moment, we believe that, even absent such studies, a non-specific vaccine boost for a COVID-19 prime would be preferable to no boost, and using existing vaccines such as IAV, OPV or BCG which provide benefit in their own right, could be implemented at “warp speed”. HVB with existing vaccine stocks of IAV, OPV or BCG vaccines are ready now, and could circumvent delays in specific vaccine production. Authors declare no competing interests. None},

In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis. We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies being investigated against COVID-19 in July 2020. Up to July 5, 2020, only one clinical trial result was published, although we found 112 clinical trial protocols targeting medical workers (n = 70, 63%), patients relatives (n = 20, 18%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n = 14, 13%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n = 69, 62%), before BCG vaccine (n = 12, 11%), this followed by numerous antivirals and immune enhancers. Ninety-eight (88%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 530 (IQR 258–1299). Both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxes are investigated.},

We have concluded that BCG vaccination early in life is highly unlikely to be a tool that might prevent SARS CoV-2 infection in adults. Furthermore, we have suggested that BCG vaccination potential benefit to decrease COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in children is confounded by many factors, e.g. age limitations of exposure and other vaccines. However, BCG vaccination booster doses in adults might be of protective value until the results of well-designed clinical trials are published to confirm, or refute, this potential.},

This question could be best answered by blinded and placebo controlled clinical trials. However, a skin reaction occurs within days at the site of BCG injection, making it rather challenging to blind this vaccination. Here, we examined registered clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov on BCG against COVID-19 by October 9th 2020, and found that 94.7% of such trials were listed as placebo controlled (all with normal saline as placebo), and single to quadruple blinded. The mode of overcoming the natural unblinding by the BCG induced skin reaction was not clarified on the website in either of the trials.

	abstract = {Tuberculosis is thought of as an ancient disease by many high-income, low-burden countries, yet it is still the leading infectious cause of death in the world, causing 1·4 million deaths globally in 2019 alone, according to WHO. Most cases of tuberculosis occur in low-income, resource-poor regions such as southeast Asia and Africa. Although the tuberculosis incidence is gradually falling, more preventive interventions are needed to reduce its burden. One such intervention would of course be highly effective tuberculosis vaccines to lower the risk of infection or prevent the progression of infection to tuberculosis disease. The only currently deployed vaccine—BCG—in use since 1921, is effective when given to infants and children and protects against severe childhood tuberculosis but provides little protection against the disease in adults. Thus, development of new, effective tuberculosis vaccine approaches is crucial. Part of the challenge in advancing research into tuberculosis vaccines is the tricky nature of the bacterial pathogen causing the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which seems to have developed many mechanisms to survive within human cells and evade the human immune response. Despite this fact, as noted by Toyin Togun (The TB Centre, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK) and Thomas Scriba (South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, University of Cape Town, Cape Town, South Africa), huge progress has been made in understanding tuberculosis immunology and researching new candidate vaccines. The Treatment Action Group (TAG) 2020 pipeline report on tuberculosis vaccines is also optimistic on the whole, and discusses the promising efficacy shown in two recent trials of tuberculosis vaccination. In the first, a phase 2a trial of the candidate vaccine H4:IC31 versus BCG revaccination in 990 adolescents aged 12–17 years in a high-transmission setting in South Africa who had previously received neonatal BCG vaccination, BCG revaccinaton was effective in preventing sustained M tuberculosis infection (efficacy 45·5%, 95% CI 6·4–68·1). In the second, a phase 3 trial of the M72/AS01E candidate vaccine versus placebo in 3575 adults aged 18–50 years with confirmed M tuberculosis infection but without disease, the vaccine seemed to protect against progression to pulmonary tuberculosis disease for at least 36 months (efficacy 49·7%, 90% CI 12·1–71·2). Additionally, the TAG report notes 16 further vaccine candidates that are at different stages of development. According to Scriba, the results of the proof-of-concept efficacy trials seem to suggest that deployment of a highly effective tuberculosis vaccine is likely within the next 10 years. But perhaps the timeframe does not need to be that long. We have seen this year the breath-taking rapidity with which the COVID-19 vaccines have been developed—within 12 months of genomic sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The process has never before advanced so swiftly. As Scriba comments, “The remarkable ‘warp-speed' at which COVID-19 vaccines are being developed demonstrates what real urgency can achieve and serves as a benchmark”. Togun agreed, adding “The incredible energy, resources, advocacy and global [collaboration] that have made possible the tremendous progress achieved in development of COVID-19 vaccines are important lessons that could help with advancing the progress in [tuberculosis] vaccines development”. However, a major obstacle for tuberculosis vaccine research and development is a lack of funding and resources. The TAG report shows that funding for tuberculosis research is still only halfway to the US$2 billion per year required according to 2018 UN figures. This is in stark contrast to the huge amounts of funding for the COVID-19 vaccines that readily poured in from private reserves and the governments of high-income nations such as the UK and the USA who pre-bought the vaccines, alleviating the usual financial concerns faced by pharmaceutical companies when developing a vaccine. Togun comments, “If the same amount of resources, energy, and active global cooperation ploughed into [the] COVID[-19] response had been directed into tuberculosis research, remarkable progress would have been made towards elimination of [the disease].” The COVID-19 pandemic has not only stalled research efforts in other diseases but additionally, ongoing developments in vaccine construct technologies, such as gene insertion from a pathogen into a weakened adenovirus (vector-based vaccines), were pivoted away from other diseases including tuberculosis towards the COVID-19 vaccines and enabled their rapid development. Scriba notes, “It will be critical that these technologies are reverted back to advance efforts for diseases such as tuberculosis”. The TAG report also highlights other ways that tuberculosis research directly contributed to providing tools for COVID-19 research; for example, with regards to non-specific effects of the BCG vaccine, the ongoing global BRACE trial is investigating whether BCG reduces the incidence of COVID-19 compared with placebo, which may be a useful weapon in blunting the effects of the pandemic. Scriba comments “Given the morbidity and mortality globally due to tuberculosis, it is time to accelerate commitment and investment to stop [this] infectious disease that has killed the most human beings”.},

To date, more than 1 million deaths and nearly 57 million confirmed cases have been recorded across 220 countries due to COVID-19, which is the greatest threat to global public health in our time. Although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses, i.e., SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), no confirmed therapeutics are yet available against COVID-19, and governments, scientists, and pharmaceutical companies worldwide are working together in search for effective drugs and vaccines. Repurposing of relevant therapies, developing vaccines, and using bioinformatics to identify potential drug targets are strongly in focus to combat COVID-19. This review deals with the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its clinical symptoms in humans including the most recent updates on candidate drugs and vaccines. Potential drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, dexamethasone) and vaccines [mRNA-1273; measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)] in human clinical trials are discussed with their composition, dosage, mode of action, and possible release dates according to the trial register of US National Library of Medicines (clinicaltrials.gov), European Union (clinicaltrialsregister.eu), and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (chictr.org.cn) website. Moreover, recent reports on in silico approaches like molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, network-based identification, and homology modeling are included, toward repurposing strategies for the use of already approved drugs against newly emerged pathogens. Limitations of effectiveness, side effects, and safety issues of each approach are also highlighted. This review should be useful for the researchers working to find out an effective strategy for defeating SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Endeavors to identify protective variables that could be potentially responsible for reduced COVID-19 impact on certain populations have remained a priority. Multiple attempts have been made to attribute the reduced COVID-19 impact on populations to their bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination coverage ignoring the fact that the effect of childhood BCG vaccination wanes within the first 5 years of life while most of the COVID-19 cases as well as deaths have been observed in adults especially the aged with comorbidities. Since the supposed desired protection being investigated could come from heterologous ‘trained immunity’ conferred by exposure to Mycobacterium spp. ( i . e ., environmental and BCG), it is argued that the estimates of the prevalence of ‘trained immunity’ of populations currently available as latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) of populations would be a better variable to evaluate such assertions. Indeed, when we analyze the European populations (twenty-four) as well as erstwhile East and West Germany populations completely disregarding their BCG vaccination coverage, the populations with higher trained immunity prevalence consistently display reduced COVID-19 impact as compared to their lower trained immunity prevalence neighbors. The incidences, mortality, and interim case fatality rates (i-CFR) of COVID-19 are found negatively correlated with the trained immunity of populations that have comparable underlying confounders not the BCG coverage per se . It is submitted that to decisively arrive at dependable conclusions about the potential protective benefit that can be gained from BCG vaccination in COVID-19, the ongoing/planned randomized controlled trials should consciously consider including measures of trained immunity as - a) all individuals immunized do not respond equally, b) small study groups of higher background trained immunity could fail to indicate any protective effect.},

Also, it can protect against other infectious diseases through the induction of trained immunity. Due to its heterologous protective effects, the BCG vaccine has been proposed as a treatment option for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological studies have found that countries without BCG vaccination policy have experienced higher mortality rates related to COVID-19 infection than those with BCG vaccination policy. However, there are some confounding factors such as age, population intensity, immigration, the pandemic phase, and data accuracy that may affect these results. Therefore, this hypothesis should be evaluated by clinical trial studies. Large-scale clinical trials are in progress to investigate if the BCG vaccine could be used as a useful tool for protection against COVID-19 infection.},

This pandemic has instigated an urgent need for a vaccine to reduce the ongoing morbidity and mortality. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) apart from being used as an effective and old vaccine against tuberculosis has some known off-target protection effect and is getting more attention in this scenario. BCG confers nonspecific innate immune-boosting effects called trained immunity against secondary infection. Various recent publications have proposed the inverse relationship between the COVID-19 morbidity and mortality with that of BCG coverage of that country on the basis of epidemiological studies. However, these studies have not considered the confounding factors, and a lot of recent articles are contradicting these epidemiological and observational data. Several random control trials for BCG on health-care workers and elderly people are ongoing worldwide and could depict the actual relation between COVID-19 and BCG protection. Although a recent trial has found a protective function of BCG against COVID-19 in health-care workers, more results of the trials can only give approval on this. There has been a shortage of BCG worldwide due to its use in bladder cancer and vaccination in neonates, and hence, its use should be carefully regulated. In this review, we have tried to summarize the various issue and conflicts on BCG to be used as a temporary solution to COVID-19.},

Leading Health Boards across the world have analyzed various related statistics with a conclusion that COVID-19 infection is going to stay here for some upcoming time. Making a thoughtful and informed decision after analyzing the situation is much better than doing trial and errors and playing with the health of people, thus, to make a relationship analysis between growth and development parameters of the country to the cases and deaths due to virus reported by that country, following main data points were collected for different countries across the globe: Literacy Rate, GDP, Percentage of GDP spent on Health, Total number of Corona Cases reported, Total Cases per million of population, Population density, Gross Income per capita, Number of internet users, Total Deaths due to COVID-19 Virus, Percentage of population below poverty line (BPL), and Health workers density. Work presents a relational demographic analysis with K-means clustering on parameters mentioned to establish a correlation between infection spread and associated parameters, with certain exceptions and reasons for it. The work proposed clearly outlines under-rated parameters that potentially impact the spread of COVID-19 spread, majorly low literacy, machine-dependent lifestyle, low economic stability, high population density, large migrants, limited healthcare infrastructure, and less gross national income per capita raised insecurities and contributed to infection spread. However, exceptions to the above exist, citing reasons such as stringent measures such as complete lockdown, environmental conditions, and effectiveness of diversified vaccinations already existing on COVID-19 such as BCG, all under research.},

	abstract = {Many studies have suggested a beneficial, non-specific effect of the now 100-year-old Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine on child mortality due to a reduction in neonatal sepsis and respiratory tract infections as well as protection against various specific viral diseases.1-6 Two mechanisms have been demonstrated by which non-specific protection against unrelated pathogens is thought to occur: (i) epigenetic training of macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells and (ii) heterologous T helper 1 (Th1) and Th17 immune responses.7 In the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries had a substantially lower mortality and morbidity due to SARS-CoV-2. Early on, some ecological studies concluded that BCG vaccination might be one of the underlying causes of the observed difference between countries, while others did not find such a correlation.3, 4, 8, 9 We used a case-control design to investigate whether BCG vaccination during childhood affects the risk of COVID-19-infection in adults. The study was conducted in East Germany at a time of the COVID-19 pandemic before the so-called ‘variants of concern’ emerged in our region. We took advantage of a federally imposed contact tracing system in Germany to selectively include uniformly defined close contacts of COVID-19-infected persons thereby having a comparable risk of COVID-19-transmission. Close contacts were considered cases if they had a positive SARS-CoV-2-PCR test and/or if SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing—which was performed at least three weeks after contact—returned a positive result. BCG vaccination status was individually assessed under consideration of vaccination certificates and additional supportive parameters by a medical professional (Appendix S1). 800 persons were invited (response rate 28.9%). Due to rigorous BCG vaccination policy in East Germany until the year 1990, age-adjusted analysis could not be conducted for older age groups due to the lack of BCG-non-vaccinated participants. 147 of 190 included individuals from 17 to 46 years of age were therefore selected for final analysis to form three age groups (17–26, 27–36 and 37–46). There were 87 females (59.2%) and 60 males (40.8%) (Table 1). Likelihood ratio tests performed to test for interaction by sex and age yielded a P value of 0.015 and 0.79, respectively, indicating that the association between BCG status and COVID-19 infection was modified by sex but not by age. Therefore, a final model of the relationship between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 infections was fitted that included age as a confounder and sex as an effect modifier. BCG vaccination status was associated with a lower likelihood of COVID-19 infection for men but not for women (ORs 0.13 and 1.04, respectively). For men, we found a highly significant association with 95% CIs ranging from 0.04 to 0.48 (p = 0.002), while for women, 95% CIs ranged from 0.40 to 2.71 (p = 0.938) (Table 2). Grossly, we observed comparatively more infected BCG-non-vaccinated males and fewer infected BCG-vaccinated males than females which resulted in a roughly balanced distribution of COVID-19 infections between males and females in our study (OR: 1.06, 95% CI 0.53–2.09 p = 0.876). BCG vaccination might differentially affect men by turning them from a natural state of being at higher risk of COVID-19 infection to a state of being at lower risk compared with women. Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination status did not seem to affect COVID-19-related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, joint pains, fatigue, dry cough and loss of smell), and no correlation between impact of symptoms on state of health and BCG vaccination status was found (overall estimate and conducted separately for males and females and two age groups [≤30 and >30 years of age] using chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test as appropriate, Appendix S1). A cross-sectional study conducted in Los Angeles found evidence of a protective effect of BCG vaccination but did not mention results from sex-stratified analysis.10 BCG vaccination was never part of the US routine vaccination programme. A case-control study from Canada evaluated COVID-19-related health outcomes for BCG-vaccinated and BCG-non-vaccinated born between 1956 and 1976 and did not find evidence of a protective effect from BCG vaccination.11 Participants in the present study tended to be much younger limiting comparability. Epidemiological investigations of sex-dependent differences in non-specific effects of BCG vaccination are scarce. A randomized trial (RCT) found that non-specific effects of BCG vaccination concerning all-cause mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period differed between males and females in the first weeks of life.5 A case-control study on children <5 years of age in Guinea-Bissau found a protective effect of BCG vaccination against acute lower respiratory tract infection, especially caused by respiratory syncytial virus, that was most marked in girls.2 In contrast, a case-control study conducted in Kenya found a statistically significant reduction in community-acquired pneumonia in BCG-vaccinated males (study population: 15–54 years of age), while no effect was present in women.6 The longevity of non-specific effects of BCG vaccination is not clear; however, monocytes stimulated with the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide a year after BCG vaccination showed an increased expression of pattern recognition receptors such as CD14, toll-like receptors (TLR4) and mannose receptor correlating with increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Similarly, heterologous immune responses with Th1 expressing IFN-γ and Th17 expressing IL-17 and IL-22 upon stimulation remained highly elevated a year after BCG vaccination.7 The impact of BCG vaccination on systemic inflammation and cytokine responses to re-stimulation has been investigated by Koeken, Netea and collaborators. Higher pre-vaccination levels and lower post-vaccination levels of inflammatory proteins were found in males. Ex vivo PBMC-derived cytokine production upon re-stimulation (14 and 90 days after vaccination) was then investigated, and strong sex-depended correlations with baseline (pre-vaccination) circulating inflammatory protein levels were found. High levels of pre-vaccination inflammatory proteins were associated with increased IFN-γ production upon re-stimulation in males.12 Very recently, homology between several SARS-CoV-2 peptides and peptides from BCG has been demonstrated. In a recent in vitro experiment, CD4+ and CD8+ cells primed with BCG-derived peptides developed enhanced reactivity to their corresponding homologous SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides. BCG-vaccinated individuals exhibited across all peptides showed a trend towards increased TNF and INF-γ responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Crucially, the participants had been BCG-vaccinated years before stimulation.13 In light of sex dependencies with respect to IFN-γ release after BCG vaccination and the recent evidence for T cell cross-reactivity between BCG and SARS-CoV-2-derived peptides, a mechanism involving heterologous immune responses mediated by Th1 cells could be hypothesized. As the effect seen in the present study was limited to COVID-19 infection with no influence on symptoms, instantaneous defence mechanisms such as pattern recognition receptors suitable to prevent infection differentially expressed by BCG-vaccinated males might play a role but cannot be elucidated from the evidence currently available. Adjustment for confounding factors other than age and sex was impeded by the study's limited sample size. Analysis of effect modification by age was affected by the strong correlation between age and BCG vaccination status in our study population, limiting any inferences about the longevity of the effect of BCG vaccination of COVID-19 infections. Notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that this study contributes to the emerging picture of a protective effect of childhood BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infection at a time, at which many countries struggle to scale up COVID-19 vaccination programmes. The selective protective effect on males found in this study could broaden the understanding of COVID-19 infection dynamics with possible use to implementation of COVID-19-related public health measures. Urgently needed further research will be challenging as increasing COVID-19 vaccine coverage will obscure the protective effect of BCG vaccination.

	abstract = {Eradication of smallpox, near elimination of poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus and substantial reduction in impact of measles are ranked amongst the greatest achievements of humankind ever. These triumphs are the outcomes of the availability and concerted use of potent, safe and affordable specific vaccines. In addition, protecting against 20 infectious diseases, the vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths annually1. Apart from natural infections, vaccines are considered as the safest and cost-effective intervention to induce protection against COVID-19. Will the vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials be able to achieve this critical milestone is not evident as of today. The entire world is looking forward to COVID-19 vaccine to bring a rapid end to the pandemic. The unprecedented global quest for COVID-19 vaccine is aimed at achieving what other public health interventions have not been able to accomplish till date to vanquish the pandemic. Vaccine is being touted as the most potent weapon to induce immunity - adequate in its immunogenicity and safety to cut short the virus transmission. The vaccine is primarily aimed to protect individuals and creating a pool of immune people that comprises 60-70 per cent of entire population23, thus inducing herd immunity. Immunology and selection of antigen for COVID-19 vaccine SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus. The viral determinants that need to be attacked to confer immunity remain undefined. While there are favourable precedents from other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses4, there are apprehensions that vaccination may mimic rapidly declining natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. The antigen of choice for COVID-19 vaccine has been the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, a type 1 protein that is metastable and should have correct folding during the vaccine production and storage before deployment56. The neutralizing antibodies to be generated by natural infection or through vaccination act against the receptor-binding protein component that binds onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and obstructs the entry of the virus into the cell. Initial evidence that only receptor-binding protein should be incorporated in the vaccine is being revisited with the knowledge that there are several areas outside receptor binding domain (RBD) that can be the potential targets for neutralizing antibody7. Neutralizing antibodies are likely to produce vaccine-induced protection. However, as with some other coronaviruses, the immune response may have short-lasting immunity not exceeding one year8. In most instances, vaccines inducing T-cell response confer protection. T-cell-mediated immune responses through CD4+ and CD8+ provide broad and long-term protection against coronavirus infections. CD4+ T-cells activate B-cells which lead to the production of virus-specific antibody. CD8+ T-cells being cytotoxic, kill cells that have been invaded by the virus. In patients with COVID-19, T cytopenia has been observed in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells91011. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells have been found in asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms. Patients suffering from COVID-19 had fewer T-cells than healthy controls12. Vaccine platforms Perhaps never in the history of combating infectious diseases, so many vaccine candidates were in varying stages of development as are for the COVID-19 pandemic. Several new and diverse technology platforms are in use to expedite vaccine development13. In its description of the global landscape of COVID-19 vaccines, the WHO reports over 163 vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation and 52 in clinical evaluation as of December 2, 202014. Broadly, these vaccines can be categorized into five main types. These include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (DNA and RNA), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles1516 (Table I).Table I: Overview of soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccinesLive attenuated vaccines closely resemble natural infection but have the potential of reverting to pathogenicity and causing disease among young and immunocompromised individuals17. Currently, no COVID-19 live attenuated vaccine is in clinical trial phase. Inactivated vaccines have proven efficacy for several diseases and their productions can be easily scaled up. The modern vaccine manufacturing units provide appropriate biosafe environment for bulk production of inactivated vaccine. One of the Indian manufacturers (Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the ICMR-National Institute of Virology) is currently moving forward with clinical trial for this category of vaccine18. Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) vaccines have low cost of production in large volumes. Once taken up by the cells, these vaccines express the antigens that have been encoded in the nucleic acid. Currently, more than 10 platforms are being used to develop nucleic acid vaccines. Successful outcome shall herald a new era in vaccine technology, especially in pandemics when vaccines need to be designed, developed and disseminated swiftly1519. Many leading global (Moderna Inc.) and Indian companies (Zydus Cadila) are currently engaged in clinical trials on nucleic acid vaccines20. Recombinant protein vaccines have a targeted approach towards a key antigen but warrant correct conformation of the protein15. The University of Oxford, in collaboration with private sector, has developed a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector expressing the wild type S protein (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, also known as AZD1222)21. Clinical trial on this vaccine is ongoing at multiple sites including in India. Only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the Russian regulatory authorities22. Yet, global community awaits data from Phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of the safety and efficacy of the Russian vaccine. Phase 3 clinical trial of Russian vaccine (Sputnik V) in India is under the approval process of the national regulatory authority23. Vaccine developed and manufactured by Pfizer has been licensed for use in the United Kingdom, United States of America, Canada and Bahrain24. Potential risks associated with vaccines An undetermined risk of COVID-19 vaccine causing disease enhancement or an acute autoimmune disease through a T-cell-mediated damage or adverse effect due to antibody is yet to be explored. Vaccines for many other diseases including influenza and measles have been associated with such unwanted and damaging events25. Such events may be detected through post-marketing surveillance of COVID-19 vaccine. It is essential to generate reliable data on long-term safety of vaccines to inspire confidence in communities and their acceptance of vaccines. Repurposed vaccines for COVID-19 In the absence of the specific immunizing agent, several other vaccines have been under investigation with the hypothesis that these vaccines may modify the response of the immune system of vaccines and enhance cytokine production to provide protection against COVID-19. These include BCG26, oral polio vaccine (OPV)27 and MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella)28. For BCG vaccine alone, three multicentric randomized controlled trials are ongoing in three different countries29. A measles vaccine trial to evaluate its protection against COVID-19 is underway in Egypt30, and the USA is assessing the efficacy of OPV against SARS-CoV-231. Production and deployment of vaccine The world is estimated to need around 16 billion doses of vaccine in immediate future. It is a huge challenge to meet this global requirement in a short period. Fortunately, many national and intercountry agencies are providing substantial financial and technical support to vaccine manufacturers to build up their capacity. Development of vaccines is an expensive proposition. A dengue vaccine had cost around US$ 1.5 billion32. Cost of investment in vaccine is miniscule as compared to the losses caused by the pandemic. Many countries and organizations are supporting timely development and production of adequate quantities of vaccines and their access across the world. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) is supporting nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates33. Operation Warp Speed in the USA34 is supporting six candidate vaccines. Great Britain has allocated £250 million for development of a COVID-19 vaccine and also established a vaccine task force35 to support national development, discovery and approval of vaccines. GAVI (Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) alliance and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have provided US$ 300 million to Serum Institute of India for producing 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, half of which have been earmarked for the low- and the middle-income countries36. To facilitate and improve global access to COVID-19 vaccines, the WHO has hosted a global collaboration – Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. It comprises the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, CEPI, Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics (FIND), GAVI Alliance. The Global Fund, Unitaid, Wellcome Trust, the WHO and the World Bank37. Within the ACT Accelerator is a vaccine pillar (COVAX) which is co-led by Gavi Alliance, CEPI, WHO and many other partners. This COVAX Facility has been set up to work with countries and vaccine manufacturers to develop, manufacture and ensure access to vaccine. The Facility provides governments with the opportunity to have access to and benefit from a large portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines. The goal of COVAX is to mobilize and deliver by 2021 at least two billion doses of quality-approved vaccines38. Negotiations with vaccine manufacturers for bulk purchase shall result in an affordable cost. It is proposed to distribute these vaccines for priority use by the high-risk populations (viz. healthcare and frontline workers), followed by for vaccinating up to 20 per cent of population as per national priority. Additional doses, if available, shall be made accessible to countries based on their needs and disease epidemiology39. Challenges Development of and access to a vaccine against COVID-19 shall be a remarkable milestone but not the panacea to eliminate or contain the pandemic in short period. Challenges are numerous (Table II). These are financial, technical, logistical, social and strength of existing health system in developing countries to address the issue of universal mass vaccination, especially with limited experience in managing vaccination of adult population. Health authorities will have to decide that with initially limited availability of vaccine which category of people becomes priority population on the basis of risk assessment. They will have to consider the social and political ramifications of such decisions.Table II: Challenges in vaccination against COVID-19Logistics shall be a key consideration with all its complexities in reaching out to the entire population through an efficient deployment of the vaccine with a functional cold chain from production-to-vaccination journey. The clinical trials are conducted in defined adult populations. The vulnerable populations are excluded from these. Since COVID-19 immunization is targeted for entire global population, it shall require prior evidence of efficacy and safety in several subpopulations, especially the elderly, pregnant women, children below 18 yr of age and those who are immunocompromised or living with co-morbidities. Role of vaccine in protecting the elderly with or without co-morbidities (>60 yr of age) and inducing immunity in children in whom this coronavirus has the potential to cause paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome needs to be explored on priority through the generation of unequivocal scientific evidence39. Will the national and international regulatory bodies consider the impact of vaccines on these subpopulations which have not been evaluated in clinical trials or the licensure shall be restricted to adult and healthy population only or a universal immunization will be permitted, shall be a challenge for the regulatory bodies. Basic technical issues that require unequivocal evidence-based responses include definition of the ideal protection, type and duration of immunity to reduce the disease, associated risk of disease potentiation and superiority of vaccination over the natural infection. The scientific community needs to accelerate efforts to produce evidence-based solutions for these issues. Conclusions Unprecedented and globally coordinated research and efforts are likely to result in availability of some, if not several, vaccines against COVID-19 in the next few months. The challenge would be to ensure their optimal and cost-effective use. Despite support from international community, the cost of procurement of vaccine and its deployment for every citizen may be exorbitant for most of the developing countries. While an affordable vaccine is the need of the hour, high production and administration cost should force countries to innovate, prioritize and think out of the box to make the best use of this intervention with the sole objective to immediately eliminate the pandemic. Earliest availability of COVID-19 vaccine is projected to be late 2020 to mid-2021. However, it may take several months before global demand as well as safety, immunogenicity and efficacy criteria are fully met. This emphasizes the need for strong advocacy and sustained implementation of proven public health preventive strategies including wearing masks, maintaining adequate social distance and isolation of infectious individuals leading to swift containment of outbreaks16.},

	abstract = {Global researchers and medical experts work tirelessly to develop vaccines and drugs against COVID-19. However, it takes at least a few months, if not longer, to receive final regulatory approvals for vaccines and drugs, and the world, facing the threat of a second wave, has no choice but to implement a mandatory global quarantine, which would result in the most devastating socioeconomic disaster the world has ever seen. COVID-19 infection and mortality rates differ significantly across countries, which may be due to variations in healthcare infrastructure, testing facilities, international travel, environmental factors, and cultural norms. According to data from observational studies, epidemiological studies, and recent randomized controlled trials, existing live-attenuated vaccines such as BCG, measles, chickenpox, and OPV have immune-modulating nonspecific effects that can influence host defense against diseases caused by unrelated pathogens, resulting in lower morbidity and mortality. As a result, drug/existing vaccine repurposing is currently crucial in accelerating advanced clinical trials and reducing the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval. In this chapter we discuss how repurposing strategies have helped to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, the limitations of repurposing drugs, and the current status of COVID-19 vaccines, and the limitations of these vaccines due to evolving genome of coronavirus strain.},

	abstract = {Background: Adenoviral (Ad)-vectored vaccines are typically administered via intramuscular injection to humans, but this route of delivery is unable to induce respiratory mucosal immunity which requires respiratory mucosal route of vaccination. However, inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccines has remained poorly characterized and its ability to induce respiratory mucosal immunity in humans is still unknown. The goal of our study was to evaluate and compare the safety and immunogenicity of a human serotype 5 Ad-based tuberculosis (TB) vaccine (AdHu5Ag85A) delivered to healthy humans via inhaled aerosol or intramuscular injection. Methods: In this open-labeled phase 1b trial, 31 healthy adults between 18 and 55 years of age with a history of BCG vaccination were enrolled at McMaster University Medical Centre, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. AdHu5Ag85A was administered by a single-dose aerosol using the Aeroneb Solo Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer or by intramuscular (IM) injection; 11 in the low dose (LD, 1x10e6 PFU) aerosol group, 11 in the high dose (HD, 2x10e6 PFU) aerosol group and 9 in the IM (1x10e8 PFU) group. The primary outcome was safety of a single administration of vaccine delivered to the respiratory tract by aerosol or by IM injection. The vaccine-related local and systemic adverse events were collected from participants from a self-completed diary for 14 days after vaccination and at scheduled follow-up visits. Routine laboratory biochemical and haematological tests were measured at 2, 4 and 12 weeks after vaccination and lung function was measured at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after vaccination. The secondary outcome was comparison of immunogenicity among the different routes and aerosol dose groups. Immunogenicity to aerosol or IM vaccination was measured both in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples by Luminex, and cell surface and intracellular cytokine immunostaining. Anti-AdHu5 antibodies and neutralization titers were determined before and after vaccination using ELISA and bioassay, respectively. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT02337270 . Results: The aerosol droplets generated by Aeroneb Solo Nebulizer were mostly \&lt;5.39 micrometer in size, suitable for efficient Ad-vectored vaccine deposition to major human airways. Both LD and HD of AdHu5Ag85A administered by aerosol inhalation and the intramuscular injection were safe and well-tolerated. Respiratory adverse events were infrequent, mild, transient and similar among groups. IM injection was associated with a mild local injection site reaction in two participants. Systemic adverse events were also infrequent, mild, transient and similar among all groups. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events reported nor any serious adverse events. Both aerosol doses, particularly LD, but not IM, vaccination markedly induced Ag85A-specific airway tissue-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells of polyfunctionality. While as expected, IM vaccination induced Ag85A-specific T cell responses in the blood, the LD aerosol vaccination also elicited such T cells in the blood. Furthermore, the LD aerosol vaccination induced persisting transcriptional changes in alveolar macrophages indicative of trained innate immunity. Interpretation: Inhaled aerosol delivery of Ad-vectored vaccine is a safe, economical and superior way to elicit respiratory mucosal immunity. The results of this study encourage further development of aerosol vaccine strategies against not only TB but also other respiratory pathogens including COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The explanations behind the wide spreadability of coronavirus sickness (COVID-19) are not known properly in this world. Several clinical investigations have indicated that the BCG antibody impacts on the immune system and human sicknesses which take part in the host system to such an extent that numerous types of viral diseases are extensively diminished or reduced. Subsequently, it was also observed in different studies that the recurrence and seriousness of numerous microbial or viral diseases, including COVID-19, will be lower in few countries where BCG Immunization programs are carried out. Few clinical investigations proposed by the epidemiological data have shown that the BCG antibody has a valuable impact in the treatment of COVID-19. So the BCG immunization may be found valuable in the coming months, particularly in the countries, where mass BCG immunization is done. Further thorough BCG immunization clinical trial is required to establish the above findings and its clinical significance. In future, this investigation will concentrate on the BCG vaccine and it may forestall the event of SARS-CoV-2 contamination and its succession in the large population.},

In addition, this article discusses the role of herd immunity and convalescent serum therapy in preventing and controlling SARS CoV-2. The study also determined the claims and counterclaims about their protective and therapeutic effects.\&#x0D; Method: Non-systematic review was done using different articles done on cross-reactive immunity against COVID-19 through vaccinations, previous infections, herd immunity and the therapeutic effects of convalescence serum. The search was done on the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, WHO, Euro-surveillance, CDC databases. \&#x0D; Results: Many observational correlational studies reported that BCG decreases the incidence and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, homology between the COVID-19 virus and the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) viruses was discovered. Few studies suggested the presence of cross-immunity between MMR vaccine and SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, few studies suggested protective effects of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) against SARS-CoV-2; since both viruses are positive-single-strand RNA (+ssRNA). Diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT) vaccines, particularly those that include inactivated whole pertussis vaccine, might induce B and T cell cross-reactive immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Other vaccines against Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influenza, and Meningococcal meningitis vaccines are suggested also to induce some immunity against Covid-19. It is hypothesized that infections with other Coronaviruses may cause protection against SARS-CoV-2. However, the studies done on these suggestions were mostly observational that can carry a high chance of inherent biases. There are also claims and counterclaims about the effect of herd immunity and convalescence serum on the prevention and control of Covid-19. So, appropriately designed RCTs are needed to prove or disprove their protective and therapeutic effects.\&#x0D; Conclusions: There are claims and counterclaims about the protective effects of different vaccines, previous infections, and herd immunity and regarding the therapeutic effects of convalescence serum. Comparing with other vaccines, BCG was suggested to have the highest cross-reactive epitopes against SARS-Cov-2 virus. MMR, OPV, DPT, Influenza, Pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines are suggested to protect against Covid-19. Previous infection with other Corona viruses, herd immunity and convalescence serum may play roles in the prevention and control of Covid-19. Many large clinical trials are undergoing nowadays and their results are needed to prove or disprove the cross-immunity related to SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of convalescence serum.},

BCG is a live bovine tuberculosis bacillus with immunotherapeutic effects in urothelial cancers; it is also used as vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in parts of the world. As BCG vaccination has been associated with broad protection against viral pathogens, BCG exposure through vaccination or intravesical therapy may modulate host immunity and reduce the severity of COVID-19 infection. We report the effect of BCG exposure on COVID-19 severity in oncology patients from the CCC19 registry. Methods: The CCC19 registry (NCT04354701) was used to identify patients with prior BCG exposure. Cohort A received intravesical treatment for bladder carcinoma, and cohort B received prior BCG vaccination. Each cohort was matched 3:1 to non-BCG-exposed controls by age, sex, race, primary cancer type, cancer status, ECOG performance status (PS) and calendar time of COVID-19 infection. The primary endpoint was COVID-19 severity reported on an ordinal scale (uncomplicated, hospitalized, admitted to ICU +/- ventilated, died within 30 days) of patients exposed to prior BCG compared to matched non-exposed controls. 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. Results: As of 6-Feb-2021 we included 124 patients with BCG exposure, 68 patients with bladder carcinoma who had received intravesical BCG (Cohort A), and 64 cancer patients with prior BCG vaccination (Cohort B). Median age was 76 years, IQR 69-83 (Cohort A) and 67 years, IQR 62-74 (Cohort B). Bladder cancer pts were predominately male (78%) vs 55% for Cohort B. Patients with PS 2+ were uncommon, 18% in Cohort A and 16% in Cohort B. COVID-19 illness severity was no different in patients exposed to prior intravesicular BCG (p=0.87). COVID-19 illness severity was no different in patients exposed to prior intradermal BCG vaccination (p=0.60). Conclusions: Despite this being the largest such cohort reported to date, we failed to demonstrate an association of prior BCG exposure with modulation of severity of COVID-19 illness. Prospective trials evaluating the protective effect of BCG vaccination are ongoing and will add further insight into the effect of BCG on COVID-19 illness.[Table: see text]},

	abstract = {An unprecedented pandemic caused by Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc worldwide. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are relentlessly working at the forefront and thus have high exposure and mortality rates. It was noticed that countries with Bacille Calmette-Guérin(BCG) vaccine in their immunization program had lower rates of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Thus, it was hypothesized that revaccination with BCG might confer protection against COVID-19. <b>Aim:</b> To assess the protective effect of BCG revaccination in HCWs against COVID-19. <b>Objectives:</b> 1) Comparison of rate and severity of COVID-19 infection among study groups. 2) Pre \&amp; post vaccination change in absolute counts of CD4+ and CD8+T lypmphocytes. <b>Method:</b> This randomized controlled trial allocated HCWs into test and control groups with 129 participants each after fulfillment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. HCWs in test group were re-vaccinated with BCG whereas control group was given placebo. Blood samples were taken for estimation of CD4+ and CD8+T cells counts before administration of vaccine and after 6 weeks. Participants in both groups were followed-up for 6 months. <b>Results:</b> Eight participants (6.2%) of test group contracted mild COVID-19 disease. 21(16.27%) HCWs in placebo arm contracted moderate to severe disease. Difference in absolute counts of CD4+ and CD8+T lymphocytes was found to be statistically insignificant. <b>Conclusion:</b> BCG reduces rate and severity of COVID-19 infection.},

This virus caused a new influenza-like disease termed COVID-19. By September 2020, globally more than 27 million people were infected and almost 0.9 million were dead [1]. There was neither an immediate availability of a medical cure to treat the infected nor a vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease. Most countries announced lockdowns severely impacting industrial activity and hence, the economy. Observing the rapid spread of the virus and the attendant mortality, in March 2020 the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic [2].The search for an effective therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19 began as early as December 2019. The Wuhan University filed a second medical use patent for Remdesivir, an antiviral drug that had been patented by Gilead Sciences, USA in several countries. Remdesivir had been approved as an orphan drug by the US FDA to treat Ebola, which Gilead sought to rescind in March 2020 [3]. The efficacy of Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 had not been established conclusively till August 2020, though the drug has been granted an emergency use authorization by regulatory authorities of some countries. Another antiviral drug that has been evaluated against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is Favipiravir [4]. It is established to be effective in mildly symptomatic patients when administered early in the infection. This drug has also been issued an emergency use authorization for the treatment of COVID-19 by the regulatory authorities of some countries.Currently, the pharmaceutical industry is pursuing the development of a vaccine to prevent the infection. The time required for a new drug to be discovered is about 10–12 years, while the time frame for the development of a new vaccine is even longer. However, an immediate remedy was needed to control the pandemic and to treat patients with severe symptoms, many times also suffering from comorbidities. Therefore, the pharmaceutical industry chose to repurpose existing drugs rather than searching for a new one. Earlier between February and May 2020 there were around 30 candidate drugs that were being repurposed for treating COVID-19 targeting the entry of the virus into human cells, its method of replication or the various effects it causes in the body [5]. To date, no candidate has exhibited the potential to treat the infection. In August 2020, few more new candidates had been identified for repurposing to treat COVID-19 [6]. Recent literature lists more than 100 small molecules and several other drugs, biological and vaccines being repurposed for treating COVID-19 and undergoing clinical trials [7].The route of repurposing is advantageous over the traditional route of drug discovery in terms of cost and time [8]. Repurposing is estimated to provide a drug at 60% of the cost incurred for a new drug discovery program, taking 3–4 years, which translates into about a third of the time taken for the usual route. The risk in traditional drug discovery is also reduced substantially since the repurposed drug has already been established to be safe. The drug only needs to satisfy the criterion of efficacy for the new indication through phased clinical trials. Therefore, it can be a viable route to provide expressly needed remedies at such times as the current pandemic, and also for treating diseases for which available therapies are unaffordable to patients in developing countries.However, the repurposing route still does not seem to attract the pharmaceutical industry as well as it could have been, due to commercial reasons.Reasons for repurposing not being attractiveNew chemical or biological molecules are eligible for the strong protection that a product or composition of matter patent offers. Further, pharmaceutical innovator organizations build a portfolio around the new drug with patents protecting the process of synthesis, various conventional dosage forms, novel drug delivery systems, pure forms, enantiomers, isomers, crystalline forms, improved dissolution profiles and binding efficiencies to name a few. Such first use product patent portfolio is usually difficult to challenge and is well protected from potential infringement. The revenue accrued by virtue of this robust patent protection is necessary to ensure the sustainability of ongoing research and development programs [9].Repurposed drugs are eligible for patent protection through use claims or method of treatment claims. The European Patent Organization (EPO) provides protection for second medical use by way of a Swiss claim which reads as ‘Use of substance X to manufacture a medicament to treat a condition Y’. The Patent Acts of the USA and Australia allow protection for second medical use through method claims for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease. However, the patent laws of many countries including India, Indonesia and Argentina do not allow patent protection for repurposed drugs. Also, aligned with the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), the patent laws of many countries do not provide patent protection for methods of treatment, diagnosis or prophylaxis [10,11]. The aforementioned method and use patents provide a limited and weak scope of protection, are easy to work around and difficult to enforce [12].The drug regulations in the US provide market exclusivity of 3 years for the second indication. Europe provides an additional 1 year over the existing 8 years data exclusivity if the new use is invented within those 8 years. However, many countries including India do not have such provisions for repurposed drugs [13–15].The case of Pregabalin judged by the Supreme Court of the UK is an excellent example of poor enforcement of second medical use patents. The verdict also provides adequate evidence in the matter of the challenges faced to detect infringement by the various stakeholders, namely the manufacturer, physician, pharmacist and patient. The Court concluded that none of the relevant stakeholders can be infringers, further emphasizing the challenges in the enforcement of such claims. One more significant conclusion drawn by the court was that when a second medical use is proposed, medicaments may need to be prescribed by their brand names, and not by their generic or international nonproprietary names [16]. On the other hand, to increase the affordability of medicines and address public health issues, the Indian Medical Council, the nodal agency to regulate medical practice in India requires that the medical practitioners prescribe medicaments by their generic names, clearly avoiding branding [17]. Thus, in such markets, especially where literacy levels are very poor, infringement (and its detection) of the rights of both the innovator and that of the proposer of the second medical use, remain unresolved issues.Pharmaceutical innovator organizations are known to pursue research and seek regulatory approvals only for those candidates which are strongly protected through patents [12]. A survey of drugs approved in India between 1991 and 2011 showed that only 5% of the drugs approved were for second indication [18]. In conclusion, a combination of nonexisting or poor intellectual property rights protection, completely absent or short tenure of market/data exclusivity and ineffective mechanisms to detect infringement contribute to making repurposing a commercially unattractive pursuit.Proposals for repurposed drugsBoth pharmaceutical and legal researchers have attempted to overcome the issues faced in repurposing drugs and suggested different approaches to resolve the various challenges. One proposal is a compensation mechanism through complex calculations for the investments carried out to conduct clinical trials for a second medical use [19]. Another proposal relates to the process of discovering new drugs. It is recommended that pharmaceutical organizations should consider exploratory research for second medical use during the clinical trials for the first use itself, resulting in the saving of resources [20]. But there is no evidence of the practical implementation of either proposal. The provision of government funding or public-private partnership schemes has also been proposed by some researchers. Another critical initiative has been the sharing of molecular libraries between corporates and research institutions to test molecules for a possible second medical use. Such practices are being observed in a few instances, particularly in the US.Intellectual property rights related initiatives undertaken during the pandemicIn April 2020, Prof Carlos Correa, Director – South Center had appealed to the Director-General of WHO, Secretary-General – United Nations and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights that “Any commercial interest supported by the possession of intellectual property rights on those technologies must not take precedence over saving lives and upholding human rights to support developing and other countries, as they may need, to make use of Article 73(b) of the TRIPS Agreement to suspend the enforcement of any intellectual property right (including patents, designs and trade secrets) that may pose an obstacle to the procurement or local manufacturing of the products and devices necessary to protect their populations [21]”.In October 2020, the Governments of India and South Africa submitted a communication to the World Trade Organization (WTO) titled “Waiver from certain provisions of the TRIPS agreement for the prevention, containment and treatment of COVID-19”. They sought to bring together the WTO members to ensure that the various forms of IP do not cause barriers for affordable access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, research, development, manufacturing and supply of products needed during this pandemic. This was supported by many countries and more than 300 organizations globally, but was objected to by countries such as the USA, UK and many other European countries [22]. The first meeting of the WTO members did not result in a consensus on the issue and the next session of the WTO is scheduled around mid-December.However, there have been no proposals to amend the patentability criteria or patentable subject matter by way of any international agreements or national statutes.Future perspectiveTo incentivize pharmaceutical companies to vigorously pursue repurposing, immediately implementable remedies as well as various long-term measures should be undertaken.The issue of infringement of second use patents can be prioritized by proposing amendments to labelling rules in national drug laws. A system to identify products approved for second medical use by overt or covert text, visual or coded symbols can be effected to protect the rights of the innovator as well as that of the proposer of the second medical use. This feature will enable detection of infringement independent of whether the products are marketed under a brand name or as a generic and in the same dose or dosage form.On a mid-term basis, research and development-based pharmaceutical organizations should open their molecule libraries to researchers who want to study them for a possible second medical use. An international repository for new molecules should be actively considered and a deposition process facilitated for obtaining patent protection for new chemical entities. This will ease the availability of molecules for further research.Eventually, over a period of time, a review of international treaties and harmonization of patentability criteria to provide a mechanism of protection for such discoveries can be considered. This is very relevant considering that even vaccines and traditional medicines are being repurposed, examples being the BCG vaccine and plants such as neem and ashwagandha for providing immunity against the COVID-19 [5].Another option that should be debated at an international level is the current model of the drug discovery. With continuous advances made in the field of data sciences, computing, artificial intelligence, testing instrumentation and synthetic processes, such technologies should be actively applied to enhance the efficiency of the process of drug discovery.In conclusion, a multi-pronged approach is required to reap the immense benefits of the repurposing route of drug discovery. This will create an alternate course of drug discovery, leading to affordable access to medicines and immense benefits to patients.Financial \& competing interests disclosureThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

	abstract = {Objectives Today Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) is the most common agent used in the intravesical treatment of non- muscle invasive (NMIBC) bladder cancer but originally was used as a vaccine against the widespread scourge of tuberculosis. The public acceptance of this vaccination was, at least in Germany, delayed by an infamous 1930 medical event in which 251 infants were accidentally inoculated with a batch of BCG vaccine contaminated with live mycobacterial cultures. The accident itself was comprehensively investigated but those affected were forgotten. For this oral history project, adult survivors of the 1930 BCG disaster were interviewed in order to document their biographical outcomes and personal perspectives. Methods We conducted personal, recorded interviews with identified survivors of the 1930 BCG accident and relatives. We analyzed contemporary news articles and accounts and secondary sources from German medical and popular literature. Results Of the survivors, a total of 8 patients and 8 family members of patients were interviewed. In addition, two interviews were also conducted with relatives of the presiding judge from the 1931/2 trial and of an involved physician. The 18 biographies make up the dataset for this study. Interviewed survivors, the so called ‘Calmette Kinder’ (Ger.”Kinder”: Children), recounted years of illness and chronic health impairments. The supportive measures taken after the accident by the town of Lübeck were extensive and ranged from medical care and health promoting measures such as additional food for the vaccinated infants to the establishment of an arbitration court for the compensation of the ‘Calmette Kinder’. Conclusions The Lübeck Disaster was a landmark event in the history of biomedical safety, ethics and informed consent. The decades-long consequences of a failed vaccination effort for infants still urges a cautious, measured approach to medical progress today. Lessons learned were critical for the establishment of the modern approach to public vaccination efforts so well-illustrated in the fight against CoVid 19 and other microbiological threats.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a major health threat caused by the intracellular bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Globally, 10 million individuals fell ill of TB and 1.4 million died in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted on TB notifications in 2020, thereby markedly increasing morbidity and mortality caused by TB. The lung is the most frequent site of disease manifestation, the site of pathogen entry and the source of dissemination. In the infected lung, granulomas are formed at the site of Mtb persistence which primarily consist of macrophages of different maturation stages and T lymphocytes. Solid granulomas contain Mtb, thus preventing outbreak of active disease. The individual is now latently infected. Once Mtb evades immune control, granulomas become necrotic and later caseous. Active TB disease has started. Diagnosis of TB is done by chest X-ray, microscopy, bacterial culture, molecular test, and immunologic test. TB can be cured by a combination of 3-4 specific drugs given over a period of 6-9 months. Increasing incidences of multi-drug and extensively drug-resistant Mtb render therapy difficult to impossible. The current vaccine, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) prevents extrapulmonary childhood TB but fails to protect against pulmonary TB in all age groups. New vaccines against TB are urgently needed. New candidates that have entered clinical trials are killed whole cell vaccines, recombinant live vaccines, Mtb antigen-adjuvant formulations or viral vectors expressing Mtb antigens.},

	abstract = {Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently-discovered beta coronavirus capable of infecting humans and causing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 causes a variety of pathologies that are still being understood. While vaccines specific for COVID-19 are being developed and deployed throughout the world, another vaccine called Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine is being trialled to test whether it has a protective effect against COVID-19. Epidemiological studies have identified a negative correlation between BCG vaccination regime and COVID-19 severity and mortality. However, the mechanism by which a vaccine for a bacterium can protect against a virus is not well understood. Here we have identified a number of homologous peptide sequences shared between BCG and SARS-CoV-2. Using in vitro human T cell recall assays, we found that pre-sensitisation to BCG-derived peptides can induce T cell cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 peptides. These findings assist in explaining the molecular mechanism behind the protective effect conferred by BCG vaccination in COVID-19, and supports the clinical trials exploring BCG vaccine as an integral part of the global effort to vaccinate against COVID-19.},

This dire situ- ation has driven a monumental global effort has to urgently produce suitable vaccines to prevent and stem COVID-19. However, there remains a lack of consensus as to what constitutes a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine strategy, with current trials not designed to detect a reduction in the likelihood of severe illness and stemming of disease trans- mission. Critically, however, most indicators suggest that millions of high-risk individuals will not gain access to vaccines any time soon (persons ≥ 65 years of age, persons with underlying conditions, the economically deprived, and various ethnic minorities). Considering such concerns, per- haps deployment of existing vaccinations with document- ed results could be deployed to assist in interim efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19. Some vaccines such as the Bacilli-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine may confer non-spe- cific protection or effects (NSE) against disease other than its intended target. In this article, we discuss recent efforts to investigate how such approaches may be beneficial and present our hypothesis that such non-specific events of simi- lar vaccines may assist in prevention of severe disease while specific COVID-19 vaccines are further developed and made available to the most high-risk individuals.},

	abstract = {Despite the implementation of mitigation measures, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still spreading worldwide, and has caused more than 1 million deaths so far. Although recent reports indicate that three vaccine candidates are effective against SARS-CoV-2, more time is needed to generate enough doses for the general population. Meanwhile, frontline healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. To avoid collapse of the medical care system, there is a need to develop novel approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread. Through a process called trained immunity, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine boosts the action of innate immune cells, resulting in a nonspecific reduction in the incidence of viral infections. Due to this immunomodulatory action, the BCG vaccine is currently used as a therapeutic in bladder cancer. Data collected from epidemiological and observational studies indicate that BCG vaccination might provide protection against COVID-19. While these observations do not provide evidence of causality and are limited by cofounding and intrinsic biases, it is crucial to explore the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may provide a nonspecific innate immune boost and therefore protect against COVID-19 in randomized controlled clinical trials, particularly for people at higher risk of developing COVID-19, such as frontline healthcare workers.},

	abstract = {Since the end of 2019, when the world was struck by the COVID-19 pandemic,1, 2 discussions regarding immunology seem not to be restricted to lecture halls and laboratories anymore, but have moved beyond the scientific community into public society. Popular talk shows and social media platforms nowadays not sporadically contain (non-scientific) conversations about herd immunity, neutralizing antibodies, the R-number, T cell cross-reactivity, rapid tests, host-directed therapy (chloroquine), and, of course, vaccines. With respect to the latter, the post-COVID-19 laymen attention focuses, besides on availability, on vaccine composition, regimen, trials, boosters, and efficacy, topics that, not too long ago, were considered far from appealing topics of conversation by non-scientist. To pull us out of the economically and socially devastating restrictions imposed on society by this global pandemic, the hope of the public is now directed on the new anti-COVID-19 vaccines that are currently being rolled out in many countries across the world. Taken this present-day extent of public attention for immunology into consideration, it should have become common knowledge by now that long-term investments in research of immunology (inseparably linked with vaccinology) of infectious diseases, including those caused by pathogenic mycobacteria, have provided vital contributions to the current capability to develop and produce COVID-19 vaccines in <1 year. Still, development of better diagnostics and improved vaccines has been relatively slow despite their protracted impact on the health of humans and animals as well as global economies. This controversy is reflecting the unpropitious funding situation of this research domain, which is quite disproportional with the number of casualties particularly in the case of tuberculosis (TB), a respiratory disease that, before 2020, has been more lethal than any other disease from a single infectious agent.3 However, in contrast to COVID-19, which has severely hit Europe and the USA as well, mycobacterial diseases mostly affect individuals in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This volume of Immunological Reviews comprises papers that encompass (recent) findings on the immunology of mycobacterial diseases caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), M leprae, M ulcerans, M avium, M absessus, M bovis, and M avium subspecies paratuberculosis, as well as immunity induced by the vaccine strain M bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), thereby illustrating the progress made in basic research on Immunity to Mycobacteria. This includes the role that classical and more recently discovered (T) cells play in these intriguing host-pathogen interactions as well as potential application thereof within vaccination strategies and as correlates of protection and disease in diagnostics. To unravel mechanisms of disease various “omics” technologies have contributed, leading to new insights regarding (prospective) diagnostics for4-8 as well as immune mechanisms of mycobacterial diseases.9, 10 In addition, it addresses the plethora of sophisticated survival strategies including manipulation of phagosome maturation, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, antigen presentation, and metabolic pathways that these mycobacteria can employ to evade the hosts’ immune systems. Despite the discovery of effective antibiotic treatments and neonatal BCG vaccination in endemic areas, tuberculosis (TB) has historically caused more deaths than any other single human infectious disease worldwide, even surpassing HIV/AIDS and malaria as the leading cause of death.11 Globally, an estimated 10.0 million people fell ill with TB in 2019 and 1.4 million deaths (including 208 000 among HIV-positive people) were attributed to this disease representing more than 3800 deaths per day.11 It is estimated that about 1,7 billion people (23% of the world's population) are latently infected with Mtb and thus at risk of developing active TB disease sometime during their lifetime.12 Moreover, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) represents a major obstacle to effective care and prevention worldwide. Furthermore, the large gap (2.9 million) between the number of newly diagnosed patients reported and the estimated 10 million active TB cases, which is due to a combination of under-reporting of detected cases and under-diagnosis (if people with TB cannot access health care or are not diagnosed when they do),13 calls for better diagnostic tests. Of note is also the One Health aspect of this disease, as in LMICs, a significant number of human TB cases are actually caused by M bovis infection.14-16 Since vaccines, in general, represent an extremely efficient way to reduce disease burden by preventing disease or even infection,17 multiple research projects have focused on new vaccines and vaccination strategies to prevent TB as alternative to or combined with BCG.18-21 In order to develop new vaccines, detailed insight into the complex events of host immunity against mycobacteria has been deemed necessary for decades.22, 23 At the basis of such efforts lies the search for what substantiates the optimal protective, non-pathogenic T cell response.24-26 This involves a growing number of T cells that contribute to either enhancing or suppressing protective immunity and recognize antigens involved in various stages of infection and disease.21, 27, 28 A dominant role is reserved for CD4 T cells as clear from depletion of this subset or transduction of HLA class II in animal models and supported by the fact that patients with HIV infection who have reduced CD4 T cell counts are more susceptible to primary Mtb infection, reinfection and reactivation.27, 29-31 In this issue, Morgan and colleagues (IMR-2021-001.R1) provide a holistic view on the role of classical, HLA class II-restricted CD4 T cells in Mtb infection. From this perspective, they compare the presence of various classical CD4 T cell subsets (classified using proteomics in functional signatures according to extensive cell surface expression as well as cytokine production), that have been identified to have importance for Mtb-specific immunity in either latent infection, active TB, severe TB, after BCG-vaccination, or environmental exposure (eg, by non-tuberculous mycobacteria). This involves a detailed subdivision into memory phenotypes and helper T cell phenotypes like Th1, Th2, Th17, and the heterogeneous Th1*, a distinct hybrid Th1/Th17 population.32 Besides CD4 T cells, they discuss their antigenic targets which identified, for example, using epitope megapools33 (4,000 ORFs of the Mtb genome) as universal tool to measure HLA class II-restricted CD4 T cells across different disease states. Jointly, CD4 activation markers, the epitopes they recognize, and proteins they secrete as well as transcriptomic and metabolomic markers are promising correlates of protection, although they may vary in different populations. On the other hand, Ruibal and colleagues (IMR-2020-074.R1), inspired by the limited success of vaccines against TB based on classical T and B cells, embark on the non-classical path and convincingly argue on the value of donor-unrestricted T-cells (DURTs) as targets for novel vaccines against TB. The attractiveness of these DURTS lies in the fact that they recognize antigenic ligands via genetically conserved antigen presentation molecules such that their application avoids. The attractiveness of such an approach is that DURTs, in contrast to classical T cells which are activated via highly polymorphic HLA class I and II molecules, can respond to the same ligands across diverse human populations. This not only provides advantages for vaccination but also for correlates of protection. In their contribution, they describe several populations of T cells categorized under DURTS such as HLA-E-restricted T cells,34, 35 CD1-restricted T cells, mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAITs), and TCR γδ T cells. Besides DURTS, they discuss NK cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and the gain of targeting these cells with vaccines against Mtb. It needs to be assessed in future studies how, combined with classical immune responses, these unconventional subsets have potential to contribute essential, additional protective immunity against TB, leprosy, and NTM infections. The role of yet another T cell subset is scrutinized in the review by Verma and colleagues (IMR-2020-082.R2) who discuss regulatory T cells (Tregs)36 in the context of homeostasis. But also the potential role of Tregs in tipping the (Th-Treg) balance based on studies in humans and animal models of Mtb that suggest Tregs cannot only help reduce tissue-damaging inflammation, but also have immunosuppressive functions that interfere with protective responses against this mycobacterium. Additionally, they describe immune mechanisms in the often difficult to treat infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as M avium and M absessus the prevalence of which is increasing at an alarming rate.37 From a completely different angle, Kilinç and colleagues (IMR-2020-087) believe in prospective use of host-directed therapy (HDT) to tackle the problems encountered in mycobacterial infections, namely the multiple counter-strategies that mycobacteria have ingeniously developed to persist and survive inside host cells. This has been investigated substantially already for the cunning tactics that Mtb utilizes,38, 39 but receives warranted attention for NTM as well in this review for which they included all relevant studies of the past 20 years. In their review, they include not only Mtb infection but also discuss what is known or assumed about NTM, particularly M avium infections. On yet another angle of approach, Laval and colleagues (IMR-2020-071.R1) have chosen to investigate the effect of macrophage fatty acid metabolism on host immunity to Mtb. By integrating findings from immunological and microbiological studies, they introduce the new concept that lipid droplet formation in Mtb-infected macrophages, besides allowing the bacterium to produce energy and build the lipid-rich cell wall, may also benefit the host. This pro-host mechanism by preventing Mtb's access to host fatty acids while limiting the flux of fatty acids through β-oxidation. Key in the metabolic adaptation of macrophages to Mtb infection leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of FAs which potentiates their anti-mycobacterial responses and forces the intracellular pathogen to shift into fat-saving, survival mode. Despite years of intensive research, Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) remains the only licensed vaccine against TB. The 100-year-old vaccine protects against childhood TB, but is not unanimously effective in adult pulmonary TB. Several vaccine trials using BCG have, however, established its protective effect against leprosy40 and NTM.41 It has also become clear that BCG can modulate the innate immune system leading to protection against unrelated pathogens through a mechanism referred to as trained immunity.42 These heterologous benefits of BCG may even prove relevant in vaccination strategies to prevent COVID-19. To optimally utilize and improve upon the BCG vaccine in new vaccine strategies such as BCG re-vaccination17 or new administration routes,43 Ahmed and colleagues (IMR-2021-007) unravel what is known about protective immune responses elicited by BCG against TB and other mycobacterial ailments including factors that may be responsible for the variable efficacy of BCG such as host and environment. In view of the current COVID-19 pandemic, these authors also involve the debate on potential protective responses against SARS-CoV-2 induced by BCG vaccination.44, 45 As opposed of addressing protection against TB disease, Foster and colleagues (IMR-2020-084.R1) focus on BCG-induced protection against Mtb infection. They review evidence from observational and BCG re-vaccination studies, including limitations and variation in protection as well as possible underlying mechanisms such as antibody-mediated protection and innate immune mechanisms, particularly histone modifications at the promoter and enhancer regions of pro-inflammatory genes the hallmark of BCG-induced trained immunity. Paratuberculosis, like bovine TB, is a mycobacterial disease of ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) which has a considerable impact on livestock health, welfare, and production.46 MAP causes a granulomatous chronic intestinal infection also known as Johne's disease, impacting cattle, sheep, goat, and deer industries globally. Although there are at least three vaccines, vaccinated animals can still shed MAP thereby maintaining transmission47 and disease detection still relies heavily on dated methods. De Silva (IMR-2020-086.R2) describes potential suitable biomarkers and the immunological mechanisms they represent, focusing on the resilience phenotype. Since MAP is an enteric pathogen, she argues that vaccination inducing mucosal immunity should be prioritized. In this process, the ease of application and access to mucosal surfaces will determine the most practical and efficient vaccine. After TB, leprosy, caused by M leprae, ranks second in the order of severe human mycobacterial diseases. In contrast to Mtb, it is not very contagious, requiring frequent and intense contact c. It predominantly affects the skin and peripheral nerves reflecting the optimal growth temperature of this mycobacterium. Although leprosy is known to humans for many centuries, its immunopathology still represents a complex scientific challenge to clinicians as well as immunologists.48 Characteristic for leprosy is its unique disease spectrum, in susceptible individuals, reflecting the vast inter-individual variability in clinical manifestations, whereas it shares issues on the lack of sensitive diagnostics for early disease and infection with other mycobacterial diseases. Based on extensive immunological expertise in leprosy, particularly regarding animal models, Adams (IMR-2020-085.R1) presents a historic overview identifying key immunological aspects of the immune response against M leprae based on different animal models (mostly mice, non-human primates, and armadillos) that have been used for leprosy research compelled by the inability to culture this mycobacterium in vitro. The generation of various knockout mice has not only provided more insights into which immunoregulatory mechanisms lead to susceptibility or protection, but also provide well-defined models for different parts of the disease spectrum including leprosy reactions which are difficult to study in humans. Since an additional advantage of animal models is that dose, time, and site of infection are known, the genetically altered mice represent useful tools for assessment of new (chemoprophylactic) treatment regimens, vaccines, and diagnostics. Van Hooij and Geluk (IMR-2021-003) aim to identify phase-specific biomarkers to improve leprosy diagnostics by assessing studies published about the role of various cell subtypes associated with M leprae infection and the various disease states in which leprosy occurs in humans. Taking the alleged route M leprae follows in the host, this leads them to conclude that the innate immune system is dominant in the initiation of nerve damage, an early disease manifestation, whereas the adaptive immune system further aggravates nerve damage and determines the type of leprosy. Application of biomarkers associated with different forms of leprosy will improve leprosy diagnosis and treatment. A different view on the maneuvers of M leprae to evade protective host immunity is provided by Oliveira and colleagues (IMR-2021-002.R2). Driven by the findings that genetic variations in enzymes related to central metabolism and mitophagic process, such as HIF-1α, FAMIN, PRKN, and LRRK2, are associated with leprosy, they focus on mitochondria as target of suppression of host defense. It is presumed that Mleprae reduces the generation of oxidative stress concomitantly lowering inflammasome activation and other pertinent mitochondrial signaling involved in innate immunity. These insights generate options for new drugs that block mitochondrial deactivation. Buruli ulcer (BU) represents a neglected tropical skin disease manifesting as chronic wounds that can leave victims with major, life-long deformity and disability. The causative agent, M ulcerans, possesses a unique trait as, in contrast to other pathogenic mycobacteria, it produces mycolactone, a diffusible lipid factor with unique cytotoxic and immunomodulatory properties.49 An additional divergence compared to TB and leprosy is that epidemiologic and genetic analyses argue against human-to-human transmission. BCG is the only vaccine available that has been studied for BU prevention, but only conferred short-lasting protection.50 DeMangel (IMR-2020-083.R1), completes this issue with a comprehensive review on the immunosuppressive properties of mycolactone including blockade of Sec61, the host receptor mediating the immunomodulatory effects of mycolactone and thereby the virulence of M ulcerans. Finally, Fevereiro and colleagues (IMR-2020-088.R1) elegantly review the most recent data on “Buruli ulceromics”, that is, omics-based studies on Buruli ulcer including GWAS to depict the mechanism of M ulcerans infection. They describe the resemblance with and differences from host immune responses in other mycobacterioses. As has been shown for TB and leprosy, application of omics-based research provides promising options for Buruli ulcer research which are required to render this disease truly negligible. Together, this volume provides a wide-ranging update on current views of immunological mechanisms involved in mycobacterial infection and disease which display potential for translational research regarding development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics. The comprised reviews will hopefully instigate innovative research activities aimed at developing novel therapeutic strategies for mycobacterial disease in humans and animals that are as inventive as their causative agents.

Although the research is targeting COVID-19, it is envisaged the technology can provide a platform to treat other infectious diseases.Intradermal delivery has long been recognized as an effective delivery route for vaccines and other therapeutic agents; Sanofi Pasteur (Paris, France) has US FDA approval for a flu vaccine delivered by this route using a prefilled syringe with a microneedle. It is argued that the epidermis can elicit a strong immune response and that injection into this region is less painful than for conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. Microneedle arrays such as the one being developed by the team in Swansea enable a device to be applied as a patch, with multiple needles increasing the delivery rate of a therapeutic or vaccine. This approach could also allow self-administration of a vaccine that could accelerate the roll out of the vaccine program. However, progress in developing microneedle patches has been slow due to challenges in developing technology and fabrication methods that enable high volume manufacture at low cost. Concerns also remain around their safety and efficacy [2].The Swansea team claim their device, once developed, would be first smart vaccine device that will both deliver and measure the efficacy of a COVID vaccine. They argue that the approach would enable more efficient vaccine trials to conducted and would also allow those vaccinated to know when they have achieved immunity.Janssen reports topline efficacy data for its Phase III study for a single-dose COVID-19 vaccineJohnson \& Johnson’s (Beerse, Belgium) announced topline data for an investigational single-dose COVID-19 vaccine being developed by its pharmaceuticals division, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies (Beerse, Belgium) [3]. The analysis came from 43,783 participants with a total of 468 symptomatic cases of COVID-19 with study end points at 14 and 28 days after vaccination. Across all the regions studied, USA, Central and South America and in South Africa, the vaccine was on average, found to be 85% effective in preventing severe disease. For the vaccinated cohort, onset of protection was observed from day 14 and continued to increase during the study with no cases of severe disease reported after day 49. The safety profile was good, with serious fever occurring in less than 0.2% of those treated. Serious adverse events were lower in the treated arm compared with those who received placebo.The vaccine uses a human adenovirus that has been modified to incorporate a gene for making the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. When the adenovirus enters a host cell, the spike protein is created, triggering an immune response that then provides protection again SARS-CoV-2 virus.The fact that the vaccine achieved a good level of protection with a single injection is seen as a significant advantage over other vaccines approved to date that require two injections several weeks apart to achieve protection.The vaccine candidate utilizes Janssen’s proprietary AdVac® platform, which has already been used develop and manufacture an Ebola vaccine regimen that has been approved in Europe and is being used in other vaccine developments against Zika, RSV, and HIV. To develop the vaccine, Janssen entered a collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (MA, USA) in March 2020.Janssen stated it intends to file for US Emergency Use Authorization in the coming weeks and expects to have product ready for immediate shipment on a not-for-profit basis following authorization.Novavax report results for its COVID-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373Novavax (MD, USA) also announced interim results for a study testing the safety and efficacy of its NVX-CoV2373 vaccine against COVID-19 [4]. In a study that enrolled more than 15,000 participants between 18 and 84 years of age, 62 COVID-19 cases were observed with 56 in the placebo group versus six cases observed in treated group, resulting in an estimated 89.3% vaccine efficacy. Importantly, given increasing concern around new variants of the virus that are more transmissive, and which might be resistant to earlier vaccines, it was encouraging that around 50% of the confirmed COVID cases in the study involved the UK variant of the virus. This suggests there was good exposure in the study to this variant and that immunization against it was effective. Based on this study and other studies running in the USA and Mexico, Novavax claim that this was the first vaccine study to demonstrate clinical efficacy against the new UK and South Africa variants of COVID-19.Unlike the other COVID-19 vaccines approved to date, NVX-CoV2373 introduces the spike protein directly into the host rather than replying upon the host’s own cells to create the protein. To do this, the vaccine utilizes the company’s recombinant nanoparticle technology to create an antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein. A proprietary adjuvant is used in the vaccine formulation to enhance the host immune response after injection.Based on these results, Novavax announced that it has started a rolling submission to the The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK’s regulatory authority for medicines approvals.Lilly reports study results for neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) that suggest it can reduce risk of COVID for care home residents by up to 80%Although a lot of the focus on treatments for COVID-19 has been on vaccines, there is still a need to identify medicines that can reduce the severity of the disease for those already infected. In many cases, this has involved looking at opportunities for repurposing existing approved drugs, but this month, Eli Lilly and Company (IN, USA) announced results of a study to assess the effectiveness of its drug bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in reducing risk of contracting symptomatic COVID-19 among residents and staff of long-term care facilities [5]. The study involved 965 participants who had tested negative, and 132 who has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 virus at baseline and were then randomized to receive either 4200 mg of bamlanivimab or placebo. After an 8-week follow-up, there was a significantly lower frequency of symptomatic COVID-19 (the primary end point) in the bamlanivimab treatment arm versus in the placebo arm, suggesting that the drug was effective in reducing preventing infection by the virus as well as potentially treating those in the early stages of infection.Unlike a vaccine that aims to stimulate the body’s own immune response to a virus, bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that directly targets the virus and aims to neutralize it. As a result, it may be effective in preventing serious disease in those already infected by SARS-CoV-2 virus, but compared with vaccines it is unlikely to be cost effective in the prevention of the disease. The data outlined in the press release is from a larger study, BLAZE-2 that aims to enroll around 5000 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug in the treatment of COVID-19. The drug was developed in collaboration with Canadian biotechnology company AbCellera (Vancouver, Canada) specifically for the treatment of COVID-19 and although not approved, is authorized for emergency use by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients for as lower dosage form (700 mg), delivered by infusion.Acquisitions, licensing deals \& other commercial newsSanofi to acquire KymabSanofi (Paris, France) announced it is to buy Kymab (Cambridge, UK) for an upfront payment of approximately US$1.1 billion with a further $350 million contingent on achievement of specified milestones [6]. Kymab is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and in immuno-oncology. Its lead compound, KY1005, targets T-cell immune dysregulation in patients with immune-mediated conditions and in a Phase IIa study in 2020 reported positive results in the treatment moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Other drugs in its pipeline include KY1044, in clinical development for the treatment of cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapeutics and KY1043 an immune checkpoint inhibitor in preclinical development, also for the treatment of cancer. It has partnerships with Novo Nordisk (Bagsværd, Denmark), Sosei Heptares (Cambridge, UK) and a collaboration with Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation (WA, USA) focused on the identification of new vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to a range of infectious diseases.As well as adding KY1005 to its pipeline, the acquisition will also provide Sanofi with access to new antibody technologies and research capabilities. It is anticipated that the purchase will conclude during the first half of 2021.Gilead \& Vir Biotechnology to collaborate on treatments for chronic hepatitis BGilead Sciences, Inc. (CA, USA) and Vir Biotechnology (CA, USA) announced a collaboration to evaluate therapeutic combination treatment approaches that might provide a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) [7]. They plan to initiate a multi-arm Phase II study to investigate combinations of their developmental drugs, selgantolimod, VIR-2218 as well as a commercially sourced PD-1 antagonist as a potential treatment pathway for the disease.Although current antiviral therapies for HBV can suppress the virus, they rarely achieve complete clearance and thus require continuous treatment. VIR-2218 is an investigational drug being developed by Vir and currently in Phase II studies in combination with pegylated IFNα-2a, an approved immunomodulatory agent. It is a subcutaneously administered siRNA that targets HBV, with the objective of stimulating an effective immune response and direct antiviral activity against HBV. Studies have shown that it can reduce levels of hepatitis B surface antigen, a protein associated with HBV. Selgantolimod is an investigational drug being developed by Gilead that induces cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that activate an antiviral function by multiple immune mediators that can target HBV. It is administered orally. PD-1 antagonists inhibit PD-1 that downregulates T-cell function, thus increasing immune response. They have been approved for cancer treatment, but it has been suggested that they could have a role in the treatment of HBV by reinvigorating dysfunctional T cells that are observed in patients with the chronic disease. The rationale for a combination approach being pursued by Gilead and Vir is that a curative treatment requires a reduction of the levels of circulating viral proteins together with stimulation of the immune system to generate new T cells that can then bring the infection under control.Vir is clinical-stage immunology company focused on the use immunologic approaches to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases including HBV. Gilead has a long-established presence in the treatment of hepatitis including Vemlidy, a drug approved for the treatment of HBV in Europe and the USA.Merck acquires mRNA contract development \& manufacturing organization AmpTecMerck (Darmstadt, Germany) announced that it has acquired AmpTec (Hamburg, Germany), a contract development and manufacturing organization with capability in mRNA technology [8]. Although Merck is best known as a pharmaceutical company, it has diversified activities in lifesciences and the supply for performance materials including in diagnostics, electronic displays and gene editing. The acquisition of AmpTec complements its existing capability in the manufacture of lipids that are commonly used as carriers for the delivery of mRNA therapies. AmpTec also has a diagnostics business that focusing the manufacture of RNAs and DNAs for in vitro diagnostics, which adds to Merck’s current activities in the production of raw material for the sector. The value of the acquisition transaction was not disclosed.Novartis invests in Credence for injectable delivery scale-upCredence MedSystems (CA, USA), a developer of drug-delivery systems, announced a strategic investment in the company by Novartis (Basel, Switzerland) [9]. The undisclosed investment will support development and scaling of Credence’s innovative drug-delivery systems, focusing initially on its Companion® Safety Syringe System. The syringe system is designed to prevent reuse and incorporates proprietary automated needle retraction technology. An attraction of the system is that compared with a conventual syringes, it does not require any additional user steps to ensure needle safety after use. The Novartis investment follows news of a collaboration with Schott, a leading provider of primary drug packaging solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, that will see the two companies collaborate to incorporate Credence’s safety needle into SCHOTT’s pre-fillable syriQ® glass and SCHOTT TOPPAC® polymer syringes. Prefilled syringes are used by pharmaceutical companies to provide ready to use systems for injectable drug delivery, reducing drug preparation and delivery errors. Integrated needle safety is increasingly being used to avoid needle stick injuries during and after use in both initial and at-home settings.Amneal to acquire substantially all of Kashiv Specialty PharmaceuticalsAmneal Pharmaceuticals (NJ, USA) announced that it is to acquire 98% of Kashiv Speciality, a subsidiary of Kashiv Biosciences (NJ, USA) for approximately $70 m upfront plus an additional $8 million in contingent payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones as well as royalties on future sales [10]. The deal gives Amneal ownership of four publicly disclosed drug-delivery platforms; a gastric retention technology in the form of a swellable pill, an osmotic oral drug-delivery system that provides delayed drug release and formulation technologies to improve drug solubility and sustained drug release. Kashiv Speciality has focused on using these technologies to develop new dosage forms of existing genetic drugs using the FDA 505 (B) (2) approval route. This allows the new form of the drug to utilize existing safety data from the original innovator product but also improve its performance using new formulation or device technology.Regulatory newsViiV Healthcare announces FDA approval of CabenuvaViiV Healthcare (NC, USA), a company majority owned by GlaxoSmithKline plc (Brentford, UK) announced that it had gained FDA approval for Cabenuva for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults [11].The treatment consists of two co-packaged injectable drugs: cabotegravir, which was developed by ViiV, and rilpivirine, an approved drug developed by Janssen. Dosing is monthly rather than the daily treatment for other approved treatments. In pivotal studies for the new drug, 90% of patients preferred it to their existing treatment, presumably driven by the convenience of less frequent dosing even though this requires two injections per month rather than a daily tablet.ViiV Healthcare is a specialist HIV company established in 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer (NY, USA), with Shionogi (Osaka, Japan) becoming a partner in 2012.Updates on clinical researchLyndra Therapeutics announces first subjects dosed in Phase I clinical trial of once-weekly rosuvastatin extended-release capsule, LYN-047Lyndra Therapeutics (MA, USA) announced initiation of a Phase I study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a once-weekly formulation of rosuvastatin, a drug used to treat dyslipidemia, a disease arising from abnormal levels of cholesterol or lipids in the blood [12]. Rosuvastatin, is normally administered as a daily pill, but this can result in poor adherence, which can be at least partially addressed by moving to less frequent dosing.Lyndra has been working on an extended-release oral capsule designed to provide consistent drug levels for a week or more. The approach uses extrusion technology to incorporate active drug into polymer rods, which are then assembled into flexible star-shaped structures, or stellates that can then be folded into a conventional pill capsule. Once swallowed, the capsule disintegrates in the stomach and the stellate expands. It is then retained in the gut for an extended period during which the drug is released at a constant rate. After a period of time, the structure disintegrates, passes through the lower GI tract and excreted. In the Phase I study, to be run in Australia, 16 participants will receive a 140 mg capsule (equivalent to seven 20 mg daily capsule) in two administrations 1 week apart.In total, Lynda has eight compounds in preclinical or clinical development, in a mixture of partners and owned programs. Its lead program, for extended-release risperidone, is in Phase II.Glaukos’ glaucoma implant matches eye drops in 24-month analysisGlaukos Corporation (CA, USA) announced results from 24-month interim analysis of a 36-month study initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of travoprost delivered from it iDose® TR sustained-release ocular implant for the treatment of glaucoma [13]. The 154-subject, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, study compared effectiveness of two different travoprost release rates from the implant to a comparator, timolol applied topically to the eye twice daily. The primary efficacy end point is noninferiority in reduction of intraocular pressure of the implant treatment compared with the eyedrops. Topically glaucoma treatments are known to have adherence issues and it is hoped that iDose® device can provide an alternative dosage regimen that could result in better outcomes. Although the results showed little overall difference between the treated and control groups, around 20% of participants showed average intraocular pressure reductions from baseline of at least 40%, respectively, versus 13% in the timolol control arm suggesting the treatment is more effective than eyedrops for at least some glaucoma patients. The study showed favorable safety for the implant.Glaukos Corporation is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases.Biohaven provides a clinical update on Alzheimer’s drugBiohaven (CT, USA) announced disappointing results for a Phase II/III trial for an investigational drug, troriluzole targeting symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [14]. The topline results failed to show any benefit of the drug over placebo measured using cognitive assessments or change in hippocampal volume as assessed by MRI. However, analysis of a subgroup including only moderate AD patients, suggested that there might be potential benefit. Further analysis will continue, and full results are expected in the coming months and will be presented at a major conference.Glutamatergic dysfunction is associated with neurodegeneration as well as with psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. Glutamate is an important neurotransmitter but excessive production results in cell stress and death. Troriluzole is a prodrug of riluzole, which is FDA approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has been tested in clinical trials for several neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and AD. Troriluzole reduces side affects associated with riluzole, potentially allowing larger doses to be administered.It was also announced this month that an FDA decision on the approval for aducanumab another AD treatment being developed by Biogen (MA, USA) and Eisai (Tokyo, Japan) has been delayed by 3 months with Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date now 7 June 2021 [15].CollaborationsNew collaboration to investigate new treatments for schizophreniaThe University of Oxford announced a new collaboration a partnership between its Department of Psychiatry, the Earlham Institute (Norwich, UK), Biogen and Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) to investigate a new drug target for the treatment of schizophrenia [16]. The collaboration will investigate which proteins are selectively produced by the kalirin gene in the human brain. Kalirin is associated with multiple neurological disorders as evidenced by genome sequencing, postmortems and clinical studies. But it has also been shown to create schizophrenia-like symptoms in kalirin knockout mice. The Earlham Institute, a center of excellence in genomics and computational biology, will lead on the bioinformatic analysis of the publicly available data for schizophrenia as well as the sequencing of protein data generated at the University of Oxford. For Biogen and Boehringer Ingelheim, it is hoped that a better understanding of the microbiological processes associated with the disease will enable the development of new and improved treatments for schizophrenia. The project is the first to be funded by the Psychiatry Consortium, an international £4 million collaboration between several global pharmaceutical companies, and charities, led by the UK’s Medicines Discovery Catapult, that supports high-value drug discovery projects in this area of unmet patient need.Science \& novel technologiesNanoparticle drug delivery technique shows promise for treating pancreatic cancerResearchers from the Kansas City Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MO, USA) and North Dakota State University (ND, USA) have developed an approach that uses nanoparticle to target the delivery drugs in the treatment pancreatic cancer [17]. Treatment by infusion of the drug gemcitabine is the current standard of care, but the drug rapidly degrades in systemic circulation, has toxic side effects, and can suffer from loss of efficacy due to tumor resistance. Consequently, the drug offers only a small improvement in patient survival time. Extracellular receptor kinase inhibitors (ERKi) provide another treatment pathway that potentially complements gemcitabine by targeting the ERK1/2 activity that gives rise to tumor resistance, but again have limitation due to toxicity, poor solubility and rapid clearance.The current research exploits the fact that pH inside tumor cells is lower than the pH elsewhere in the body, a property that can be used to target therapeutic delivery. pH-responsive nanoparticles were manufactured from polyethylene glycol-containing amphiphilic polycarbonate block copolymers with tertiary amine side chains. These structures are stable at normal in vivo pH but degrade at lower pH enabling release of a drug payload. The approach was tested using nanoparticles loaded with gemcitabine and ERKi to target cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. It was found that addition of ERKi significantly increased sensitivity of the cancer cells to gemcitabine and performance was significantly improved to that unencapsulated therapy using the same drug combination.Although further work is required before the approach could be taken into clinical testing and commercialization, the researchers believe they have identified a simple, yet efficient approach to target drug delivery for pancreatic cancer as well as potentially for other cancer types. The work was published in Molecular Pharmaceutics [18].Nanoparticle drug-delivery systemNucleic acid-based therapeutics, including siRNA have the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and AD, but a key challenge is ensuring that these entities can enter the brain safely and efficaciously. Disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) after trauma brain injury (TBI) has been used as an approach, but this only provides a limited timeframe for treatment. Researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Boston Children’s Hospital (MA, USA) have developed a new approach that uses nanoparticles to increase the efficiency of transfer and could be uses as the basis of delivery of therapeutic agents on an on-going basis. The team used nanoparticles formed from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or PLGA, which is biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that has already been approved by the FDA for use in several applications. They engineered the surface properties of the nanoparticles to maximize their penetration across the BBB in healthy mice and showed they could encapsulate anti-tau siRNA in the nanoparticles and deliver it in therapeutically significant quantities to the brain. Tau is expressed after TBI and is also associated with neurodegenerative processes and suppression is seen to be a potential treatment pathway. With this in mind, the team then went on to demonstrate the ability to reduce the expression of tau by 50%, in TBI mice by transfer of anti-tau siRNA using the nanoparticles, irrespective of the treatment being administered during or outside the period that the BBB was temporality disrupted by TBI. Attempts to deliver the anti-tau siRNA across the BBB using a conventional drug-delivery approach failed to show an effect. The researchers are now looking at other targets in addition to tau and believe that their approach should help other teams developing neurodegenerative treatments to test efficacy [19,20].Application of quantum computing to drug discoveryCambridge Quantum Computing (CQC; Cambridge, UK) and Roche (Basel, Switzerland), announced a collaboration focusing on the use of quantum computing to support early-stage drug discovery and development [21]. Quantum computing had been growing in interest over the past 10 years, as it has the potential to dramatically increase computational speed in areas such as modeling and simulation. This benefit comes about because quantum computers perform calculations based on the probability of a state whereas classical computers carry out logical operations using defined states (the 0s and 1s in a binary system). Furthermore, the information in each unit in a quantum computer (a qubit) can be influenced by the other qubits in the system which means there is an exponential increase in the information density in the system as the number of qubits are increased. In contract in classical computer there is only a linear increase in information density as the information units (bits) are increased. So, for example, IBM has estimated that modeling a penicillin molecule on a classical computer would take 1086 bits, which is more than the total number of atoms in the observable universe. But the same model on a quantum computer may only require 286 qubits. There are challenges to be overcome; for example, there is a high error rate in a quantum computer, but if this can be addressed then the technology has enormous potential in modeling and simulation. In a recent report [22], BCG (MA, USA), a consulting group, presented a roadmap for the use of quantum computing in drugs discovery starting with computer-aided drug discovery, which uses computing alongside wet chemistry testing to identify targets, through to full in silico drug discovery and design, which is probably 20 years away from being realized. The collaboration between CQC and Roche focuses on the application of noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum algorithms for early-stage drug discovery and development, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease where it can complement Roche's existing efforts in discovering and developing new treatments for the disease.SummaryThis Industry Update covers the period from 1 January through to 31 January 2021 and is based on information sourced from company press releases, scientific literature, patents and various news websites.

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 infection is mild in the majority of individuals but progresses into severe pneumonia in a small proportion of patients. The increased susceptibility to severe disease in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities argues for an initial defect in anti-viral host defense mechanisms. Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed “trained immunity,” by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections through epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. We propose that induction of trained immunity by whole-microorganism vaccines may represent an important tool for reducing susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection is mild in the majority of individuals but progresses into severe pneumonia in a small proportion of patients. The increased susceptibility to severe disease in the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities argues for an initial defect in anti-viral host defense mechanisms. Long-term boosting of innate immune responses, also termed “trained immunity,” by certain live vaccines (BCG, oral polio vaccine, measles) induces heterologous protection against infections through epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells. We propose that induction of trained immunity by whole-microorganism vaccines may represent an important tool for reducing susceptibility to and severity of SARS-CoV-2. In December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, identified a series of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology that were linked to the city’s seafood market. The spread of the infection and the subsequent health emergency led to mobilization of healthcare authorities, medical professionals, and research communities. This resulted in rapid discovery of the pathogen as a novel coronavirus, development of diagnostic tools, and steps for treatment protocols. This new pathogen was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease has been termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs mainly via respiratory droplets, similar to the spread of influenza. The estimated basic reproduction number (R0) and serial interval are 2.2 and 5–6 days, respectively, a doubling time of the number of infected subjects every 3 days. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from asymptomatic disease to mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms (fever, sore throat, cough, and fatigue) and severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death (Huang et al., 2020Huang C. Wang Y. Li X. Ren L. Zhao J. Hu Y. Zhang L. Fan G. Xu J. Gu X. et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29361) Google Scholar). Since the first reports of cases in Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly throughout the world, and on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. Millions of people have already been infected, and more than 100,000 individuals have died. Despite all preventive measures, the number of cases is still rising, with Europe and the United States being the hotspot of the pandemic but with increasing numbers of cases in other countries and continents. Epidemiological data show that the elderly and those with co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and lung diseases) are most susceptible to COVID-19 and more likely to suffer from the most severe disease complications. Interestingly, young children, including infants who are more susceptible to other infections, have milder symptoms and less severe COVID-19. One very important aspect in improving the outcome of patients with COVID-19 is understanding the mechanisms leading to increased severity and mortality. The first event after inhalation of SARS coronaviruses is invasion of epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes through binding of the SARS spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors (Figure 1; Kuba et al., 2005Kuba K. Imai Y. Rao S. Gao H. Guo F. Guan B. Huan Y. Yang P. Zhang Y. Deng W. et al.A crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in SARS coronavirus-induced lung injury.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). This complex is proteolytically processed by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), leading to cleavage of ACE2 and activation of the spike protein (Glowacka et al., 2011Glowacka I. Bertram S. Müller M.A. Allen P. Soilleux E. Pfefferle S. Steffen I. Tsegaye T.S. He Y. Gnirss K. et al.Evidence that TMPRSS2 activates the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein for membrane fusion and reduces viral control by the humoral immune response.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 4122-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), thereby facilitating viral entry into the target cell. It has been suggested that cells in which both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed are most susceptible to entry by coronaviruses from the SARS family, among which is the virus described to cause SARS (SARS-CoV) (Shulla et al., 2011Shulla A. Heald-Sargent T. Subramanya G. Zhao J. Perlman S. Gallagher T. A transmembrane serine protease is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor and activates virus entry.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and, most likely, also SARS-CoV-2. Viral entry and cell infection trigger the host’s immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells. The receptor and signaling mechanisms actually responsible for induction of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines or chemokines, by SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been identified. However, two possible mechanisms can be envisaged; one is represented by release of danger signal molecules, such as certain cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1α [IL-1α] and IL-8) or ATP, and a second may involve a different recognition pathway mediated in professional immune cells by known pattern recognition receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Figure 1). Indeed, it has been shown that SARS-CoV is recognized by TLR3 and TLR4 that induce an inflammatory reaction through both MyD88 (Sheahan et al., 2008Sheahan T. Morrison T.E. Funkhouser W. Uematsu S. Akira S. Baric R.S. Heise M.T. MyD88 is required for protection from lethal infection with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV.PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000240Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and TRIF-mediated pathways (Totura et al., 2015Totura A.L. Whitmore A. Agnihothram S. Schäfer A. Katze M.G. Heise M.T. Baric R.S. Toll-like receptor 3 signaling via TRIF contributes to a protective innate immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.MBio. 2015; 6 (e15): e00638Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and a similar process may be hypothesized for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, activation of the inflammasome and the IL-1β pathway by SARS-CoV (Shi et al., 2019Shi C.S. Nabar N.R. Huang N.N. Kehrl J.H. SARS-Coronavirus Open Reading Frame-8b triggers intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes.Cell Death Discov. 2019; 5: 101Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) is also likely to play an important role in pathogenesis; this hypothesis is supported by recent transcriptional identification of the IL-1 pathway as being strongly upregulated in COVID-19 patients (Ong et al., 2020Ong E.Z. Chan Y.F.Z. Leong W.Y. Lee N.M.Y. Kalimuddin S. Mohamed S. Mohideen H. Chan K.S. Tan A.T. Bertoletti A. et al.A dynamic immune response shapes COVID-19 progression.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; (Published online April 30, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.03.021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Induction of innate immune responses is a crucial step in the pathophysiology of the disease. On one hand, it triggers the anti-viral host defense mechanisms necessary for elimination of infection, but on the other hand, it may contribute to hyperinflammation and tissue damage during the later stages of the disease in a minority of patients. The major clinical complication in patients with COVID-19 is respiratory failure due to local hyperinflammation and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The pathophysiology of these complications has strong similarities to other severe viral lung infections, such as influenza, and other infections caused by coronaviruses (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]). An important mechanism mediating lung pathology in these infections is a cytokine storm leading to the so-called “macrophage activation syndrome” (MAS) (Channappanavar and Perlman, 2017Channappanavar R. Perlman S. Pathogenic human coronavirus infections: causes and consequences of cytokine storm and immunopathology.Semin. Immunopathol. 2017; 39: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar, Huang et al., 2005Huang K.J. Su I.J. Theron M. Wu Y.C. Lai S.K. Liu C.C. Lei H.Y.

Immunol. 2004; 136: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Indeed, an increasing number of very recent studies argue for an increased systemic inflammatory reaction in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Circulating concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), MCP1, MIP1A, and IP10, are increased in COVID-19 patients in ICU when compared to those who do not need treatment in the ICU, although the concentrations of some of these cytokines are only moderately increased (Huang et al., 2020Huang C. Wang Y. Li X. Ren L. Zhao J. Hu Y. Zhang L. Fan G. Xu J. Gu X. et al.Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.Lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29361) Google Scholar). This strong increase in systemic inflammation is associated with endothelial dysfunction, reflected by elevated d-dimers (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou F. Yu T. Du R. Fan G. Liu Y. Liu Z. Xiang J. Wang Y. Song B. Gu X. et al.Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16882) Google Scholar) and hyperactive CCR6+Th17+ T cells locally in the lung (Xu et al., 2020Xu Z. Shi L. Wang Y. Zhang J. Huang L. Zhang C. Liu S. Zhao P. Liu H. Zhu L. et al.Pathological findings of COVID-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.Lancet Respir. Med. 2020; 8: 420-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5775) Google Scholar). This is supported by a recent study that described the sequence of immune cell population changes in one patient with mild to moderate COVID-19 who recovered from infection (Thevarajan et al., 2020Thevarajan I. Nguyen T.H.O. Koutsakos M. Druce J. Caly L. van de Sandt C.E. Jia X. Nicholson S. Catton M. Cowie B. et al.Breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe COVID-19.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 453-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). In this patient, the increase in systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines was minimal, even during days 7–9, when the patient was symptomatic. This suggests that a mild course of infection is associated with few systemic inflammatory effects. These data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, COVID-19 infection. However, new studies suggest that immune dysfunction in COVID-19 is more complex. In this respect, lymphopenia is one of the most important immune features of the disease that is associated with severity, with CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes being defective (Qin et al., 2020Qin C. Zhou L. Hu Z. Zhang S. Yang S. Tao Y. Xie C. Ma K. Shang K. Wang W. et al.Dysregulation of immune response in patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China.Clin. Infect. Dis. 2020; (Published online March 12, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa248Crossref Scopus (3019) Google Scholar). Known age-related differences in the immune function of T cell and B cells could lead to insufficient control of viral replication, increasing disease severity. Consistent with this, a recent study shows hyperinflammation of the immune response in COVID-19 patients, characterized by high cytokine production capacity of circulating monocytes despite the severity of the disease (which is different from bacterial sepsis) and high systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020Giamarellos-Bourboulis E.J. Netea M.G. Rovina N. Akinosoglou K. Antoniadou A. Antonakos N. Damoraki G. Gkavogianni T. Adami M.E. Katsaounou P. et al.Complex immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.Cell Host Microbe. 2020; (Published online April 17, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). These data suggest that while sustained innate immune function leads to hyperinflammation, lymphocyte numbers decline and that their function may be defective. It can thus be postulated that, when someone with a potent immune response encounters the SARS-CoV-2 virus, strong activation of local innate and adaptive immune responses keeps viremia under control, leading to low systemic inflammation and recovery. In contrast, in individuals with a defective immune response because of old age or co-morbidities, unrestricted viral replication leads to high concentrations of the virus, which, in turn, triggers hyperinflammation and severe complications such as ARDS and death (Figure 2). It could therefore be argued that a rational immune-based therapy should be adapted according to the phase of the disease. In the uninfected host, the strategy should be to boost the innate immune responses to enable viral replication to be kept under control. In the later phase of the disease, the aim should be to interrupt the hyper-inflammatory loop to prevent severe complications. We therefore argue that induction of innate immune reprogramming (trained immunity) before infection may be a rational approach for boosting antiviral responses and thus preventing infection. Treatment with inhibitors of the IL-1/IL-6 pathway has been proposed to be useful in management of hyperinflammation in severely ill patients with COVID-19, and clinical trials with this strategy are underway. Innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Myeloid (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) and lymphoid innate immune cells (e.g., natural killer [NK] and γδT cells) contribute to activation of host defense during infection, and they are able to eliminate the vast majority of microorganisms that infect us every day. Only when this first line of defense is overwhelmed by large numbers of pathogens or very invasive microorganisms is the adaptive immune response (T and B cells) activated. For a long time, it was believed that only cells of the adaptive immune system can mount immunological memory and protect against recurrent infection. This property of lymphocytes is the basis of vaccine efficacy against specific infections. However, an increasing number of studies show that innate immune cells can also display adaptive characteristics after certain infections or vaccines, a property that is functionally similar to building immunological memory; this process has been termed trained immunity (Netea et al., 2020Netea M.G. Domínguez-Andrés J. Barreiro L.B. Chavakis T. Divangahi M. Fuchs E. Joosten L.A.B. van der Meer J.W.M. Mhlanga M.M. Mulder W.J.M. et al.Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; (Published online March 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Greater protection against reinfection, a de facto innate immune memory, has also been reported in plants and invertebrates, which lack an adaptive immune system. Studies performed in mice defective in functional adaptive immune responses, such as Scid or Rag1−/− mice, also show that partial protection from reinfection can be mediated by innate immune cells (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J. Quintin J. Preijers F. Joosten L.A.B. Ifrim D.C. Saeed S. Jacobs C. van Loenhout J. de Jong D. Stunnenberg H.G. et al.Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17537-17542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Finally, long-term functional changes with increased antimicrobial function of innate immune cells has been demonstrated in humans after vaccination with live vaccines (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J. Quintin J. Preijers F. Joosten L.A.B. Ifrim D.C. Saeed S. Jacobs C. van Loenhout J. de Jong D. Stunnenberg H.G. et al.Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17537-17542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and NK cells, are epigenetic in nature. An initial challenge of innate immune cells by vaccines or living pathogens during infection leads to activation of intracellular pathways that subsequently lead to upregulation of proinflammatory gene transcription. After the initial stimulus is eliminated or subsides, gene transcription returns to baseline. Transcription of genes important for host defense and production of proinflammatory cytokines is subsequently increased more potently when monocytes or macrophages are re-challenged with the same or a different stimulus (Netea et al., 2020Netea M.G. Domínguez-Andrés J. Barreiro L.B. Chavakis T. Divangahi M. Fuchs E. Joosten L.A.B. van der Meer J.W.M. Mhlanga M.M. Mulder W.J.M. et al.Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; (Published online March 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). To allow this to happen, the cell machinery must grant access to the regions of the genome that contain the target sequences and the regulatory elements of the genes involved in these processes. This is regulated through durable epigenetic modifications, which allow unfolding of the chromatin and accessibility of transcription factors to the promoter and enhancer regions of the involved immune-related genes (Netea et al., 2020Netea M.G. Domínguez-Andrés J. Barreiro L.B. Chavakis T. Divangahi M. Fuchs E. Joosten L.A.B. van der Meer J.W.M. Mhlanga M.M. Mulder W.J.M. et al.Defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; (Published online March 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The persistence of epigenetic modifications permits cells to remain in a “trained” functional state and allows increased accessibility to proinflammatory genes, facilitating faster and increased responsiveness after re-challenge. Metabolic processes leading to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites of the central metabolism regulate this process because they function as co-regulatory molecules for epigenetic enzymes (Figure 3). An important aspect relates to the durability of the trained immunity response, which is ensured at two levels: through effects at the level of bone marrow precursors (central innate immune memory) and at the level of tissue macrophages (peripheral innate immune memory). While transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional changes have been identified in circulating myeloid cells months after induction of trained immunity, these cells have a lifespan of only days in the circulation. This paradox has been explained by the finding that this process also takes place at the level of myeloid bone marrow progenitors, leading to a myelopoiesis bias and release of monocytes with a heightened preparedness to respond to pathogens (Mitroulis et al., 2018Mitroulis I. Ruppova K. Wang B. Chen L.S. Grzybek M. Grinenko T. Eugster A. Troullinaki M. Palladini A. Kourtzelis I. et al.Modulation of Myelopoiesis Progenitors Is an Integral Component of Trained Immunity.Cell. 2018; 172: 147-161.e12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Importantly, a second level at which trained immunity is induced is represented by the local environments in the tissue and, in the case of respiratory infections, in the lung. Experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infection. A gammaherpesvirus infection can protect against an allergic response (Machiels et al., 2017Machiels B. Dourcy M. Xiao X. Javaux J. Mesnil C. Sabatel C. Desmecht D. Lallemand F. Martinive P. Hammad H. et al.A gammaherpesvirus provides protection against allergic asthma by inducing the replacement of resident alveolar macrophages with regulatory monocytes.Nat. Immunol. 2017; 18: 1310-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), while adenovirus infection induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently induced more pronounced anti-bacterial immunity (Yao et al., 2018Yao Y. Jeyanathan M. Haddadi S. Barra N.G. Vaseghi-Shanjani M. Damjanovic D. Lai R. Afkhami S. Chen Y. Dvorkin-Gheva A. et al.Induction of Autonomous Memory Alveolar Macrophages Requires T Cell Help and Is Critical to Trained Immunity.Cell. 2018; 175: 1634-1650.e17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This suggests that induction of trained immunity can also provide protection from infections in which local host defense mechanisms are important in specific organs, such as the lung. The vaccine that has probably been best studied for induction of trained immunity is the tuberculosis (TB) vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). BCG is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of Mycobacterium bovis and is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world, with more than 130 million infants receiving this vaccine every year. Although developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, numerous studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases, so-called off-target or non-specific effects (NSEs). Several epidemiological studies in low-income countries have shown an association between neonatal BCG vaccination and a profound reduction in neonatal mortality (Benn et al., 2013Benn C.S. Netea M.G. Selin L.K. Aaby P. A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.Trends Immunol. 2013; 34: 431-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Two meta-analyses performed at the request of the WHO have concluded that BCG vaccination is very likely to have important beneficial NSEs, although the quality of some of the studies was questioned, and it was concluded that more research is warranted (Higgins et al., 2016Higgins J.P.T. Soares-Weiser K. López-López J.A. Kakourou A. Chaplin K. Christensen H. Martin N.K. Sterne J.A.C. Reingold A.L. Association of BCG, DTP, and measles containing vaccines with childhood mortality: systematic review.BMJ. 2016; 355: i5170Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, experimental studies suggest that BCG may protect against viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, human papilloma virus, and herpes simplex virus (Freyne et al., 2015Freyne B. Marchant A. Curtis N. BCG-associated heterologous immunity, a historical perspective: intervention studies in animal models of infectious diseases.Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Non-specific effects of BCG vaccine on viral infections.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2019; 25: 1473-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Moreover, studies performed in mice provide evidence of an effect of intranasal BCG administration on secondary viral infections. In two separate studies, BCG reduced viral titers of influenza A virus compared with a control, which resulted in reduced inflammation and lung injury (Mukherjee et al., 2017Mukherjee S.

Dis. 1977; 136: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, enhanced resistance against various other viruses in BCG-vaccinated mice has been described, including herpes simplex virus type 1 (Floc’h and Werner, 1976Floc’h F. Werner G.H. Increased resistance to virus infections of mice inoculated with BCG (Bacillus calmette-guérin).Ann. Immunol. (Paris). 1976; 127: 173-186PubMed Google Scholar) and 2 (Starr et al., 1976Starr S.E.

Immun. 1978; 20: 312-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCG vaccination of human healthy volunteers enhances production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 by monocytes upon ex vivo stimulation with unrelated pathogens (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J. Quintin J. Preijers F. Joosten L.A.B. Ifrim D.C. Saeed S. Jacobs C. van Loenhout J. de Jong D. Stunnenberg H.G. et al.Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 17537-17542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that, among human healthy volunteers who received a yellow fever vaccine as a model of a viral human infection, those who had received the BCG vaccine 1 month earlier had less viremia and improved anti-viral responses compared with individuals who received a placebo (Arts et al., 2018Arts R.J.W.

Only limited studies have assessed the protective heterologous effects of BCG vaccination in adults. A recent study in adolescents in South Africa, investigating the impact of BCG vaccination on M. tuberculosis infection, has recorded the incidence of other infections to assess the safety of the vaccination. While this was not a planned endpoint in the trial, it is interesting to observe that individuals vaccinated with BCG recorded a 73% reduction in respiratory tract infections compared with non-vaccinated individuals (Nemes et al., 2018Nemes E. Geldenhuys H. Rozot V. Rutkowski K.T. Ratangee F. Bilek N. Mabwe S. Makhethe L. Erasmus M. Toefy A. et al.C-040-404 Study TeamPrevention of M. Tuberculosis infection with H4:IC31 vaccine or BCG revaccination.N. Engl. J. Med. 2018; 379: 138-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A small study in Indonesia in the elderly reported that multiple doses of BCG vaccination resulted in a significant reduction in the number of respiratory tract infections compared with a placebo (Wardhana et al., 2011Wardhana D. Datau E.A. Sultana A. Mandang V.V. Jim E. The efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinations for the prevention of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the elderly.Acta Med. Indones. 2011; 43: 185-190PubMed Google Scholar). A clinical trial in Japan found a reduced risk of pneumonia upon BCG vaccination in previously tuberculin-negative elderly people (Ohrui et al., 2005Ohrui T. Nakayama K. Fukushima T. Chiba H. Sasaki H. [Prevention of elderly pneumonia by pneumococcal, influenza and BCG vaccinations].Nippon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi. 2005; 42: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The discovery that BCG can induce trained immunity and offers protection against heterologous infections suggests that BCG vaccination may offer protection against respiratory tract infections, including viral infections. We therefore hypothesize that induction of trained immunity in general, and by BCG vaccination in particular, might be a potent prevent},

It is possible that BCG-Tokyo would be preferable to BCG-Danish.9Ritz N Hanekom WA Robins-Browne R Britton WJ Curtis N Influence of BCG vaccine strain on the immune response and protection against tuberculosis.FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2008; 32: 821-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar Until these trials are complete, there are four main reasons why it is very important to adhere to WHO's recommendation that the BCG vaccine is used for COVID-19 only in randomised controlled trials.10WHOBacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination and COVID-19.https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/bacille-calmette-gu%C3%A9rin-(bcg)-vaccination-and-covid-19Date: April 12, 2020Date accessed: April 29, 2020Google Scholar First, the BCG vaccine is already in short supply, and indiscriminate use could jeopardise the supply needed to protect children against tuberculosis in high-risk areas. Second, whether BCG will be effective remains unknown: findings from the ecological studies suggesting less COVID-19 in countries with routine BCG immunisation are weak evidence because they are based on population rather than individual data and are prone to confounding.11Faust L Huddart S MacLean E Svadzian A Universal BCG vaccination and protection against COVID-19: critique of an ecological study.https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/36050-emily-maclean/posts/64892-universal-bcg-vaccination-and-protection-against-covid-19-critique-of-an-ecological-studyDate: April 1, 2020Date accessed: April 5, 2020Google Scholar Also, it is unlikely that a BCG vaccine given decades ago in childhood will ameliorate COVID-19 now. One reason for this is that the beneficial off-target effects of the BCG vaccine might be altered by subsequent administration of a different vaccine.1Pollard AJ Finn A Curtis N Non-specific effects of vaccines: plausible and potentially important, but implications uncertain.Arch Dis Child. 2017; 102: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar Third, if the BCG vaccine is not effective against COVID-19, BCG vaccination could engender a false sense of security. Fourth, careful safety monitoring in randomised trials is needed to guard against the remote possibility that up-regulation of immunity by BCG will exacerbate COVID-19 in a minority of patients with severe disease. If the BCG vaccine or another inducer of trained immunity provides non-specific protection to bridge the gap before a disease-specific vaccine is developed, this would be an important tool in the response to COVID-19 and future pandemics.

The phase III ACTIVATE trial assessed whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly. In this double-blind, randomized trial, elderly patients (n = 198) received BCG or placebo vaccine at hospital discharge and were followed for 12 months for new infections. At interim analysis, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection (median 16 weeks compared to 11 weeks after placebo). The incidence of new infections was 42.3% (95% CIs 31.9%–53.4%) after placebo vaccination and 25.0% (95% CIs 16.4%–36.1%) after BCG vaccination; most of the protection was against respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, p = 0.013). No difference in the frequency of adverse effects was found. Data show that BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections.

Larger studies are needed to assess protection against respiratory infections, including COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03296423). Infection by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus (also termed COVID-19) has a severe impact on both the health of the populations around the globe, and on the world economy. Many countries are in lockdown, with a third of the world population in some form of movement restrictions, which brings serious financial and societal consequences. The urgent need for the reversal of this situation can be met only through the generation of an immune defense shield to protect the populations from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many efforts for the development of a vaccine are under way, but it is likely that at least 12–24 months will be needed until an effective vaccine could be available. Interestingly, however, trained immunity induced by some already available vaccines such as Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), oral polio vaccine (OPV), or the measles vaccine have been suggested to be used as a potential protective approach against COVID-19 to bridge the period until a specific vaccine is developed (Netea et al., 2020Netea M.G.

Trained immunity: a tool for reducing susceptibility and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.Cell. 2020; 181: 969-977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Trained immunity is the process of epigenetic, transcriptional, and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells (such as myeloid cells or natural killer [NK] cells), leading to an increase in the cytokine production capacity and their antimicrobial function (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012Kleinnijenhuis J.

In models of experimental human infections such as yellow fever vaccine virus (Arts et al., 2018Arts R.J.W. Moorlag S.J.C.F.M. Novakovic B. Li Y. Wang S.Y. Oosting M. Kumar V. Xavier R.J. Wijmenga C.

Commun. 2019; 10: 874Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), BCG vaccination was able to induce a non-specific protection. These experimental data are accompanied by epidemiological studies in children and adults showing non-specific protection against infections and mortality by BCG vaccination. BCG vaccination reduced the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus infection in children in Africa (Stensballe et al., 2005Stensballe L.G. Nante E. Jensen I.P. Kofoed P.E. Poulsen A. Jensen H. Newport M. Marchant A. Aaby P.

Datau E.A. Sultana A. Mandang V.V. Jim E. The efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinations for the prevention of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the elderly.Acta Med.

[Prevention of elderly pneumonia by pneumococcal, influenza and BCG vaccinations].Nippon Ronen Igakkai Zasshi. 2005; 42: 34-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Finally, the concept was also successfully tested in healthy volunteers that were vaccinated with placebo or BCG vaccine and 14 days later received a tri-valent influenza A vaccine. Volunteers previous vaccinated by BCG developed significantly greater titers against hemagglutinin A of the influenza A virus, whereas their circulating monocytes were more potent for the production of interferon-gamma (Leentjens et al., 2015Leentjens J. Kox M. Stokman R. Gerretsen J. Diavatopoulos D.A. van Crevel R. Rimmelzwaan G.F. Pickkers P. Netea M.G.

ACTIVATE (a randomized clinical trial for enhanced trained immune responses through BCG vaccination to prevent infections of the elderly) is a randomized trial in which hospitalized elderly patients were vaccinated on the day of hospital discharge with single doses of placebo or BCG. Patients were under follow-up for 12 months, with the last visit of the last patient scheduled for August 2020. However, the pressure rising from the need of protection of the elderly who are considered susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 (Guan et al., 2020Guan W.J. Ni Z.Y. Hu Y. Liang W.H. Ou C.Q. He J.X. Liu L. Shan H. Lei C.L. Hui D.S.C. et al.China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.N. Engl. J.

Results of this interim analysis clearly showed protection of the elderly from new infections with major effect on the prevention of respiratory infections. From September 2017 through August 2019, 202 patients were enrolled and randomized to double-blind vaccination with placebo or BCG; four patients withdrew consent and requested removal of all data, leaving a final intention-to-treat analysis cohort of 198 patients. No patient was reported as lost to follow-up (Figure 1). Interim analysis included 78 patients allocated to placebo vaccination and 72 patients allocated to BCG vaccination.

Regarding the primary endpoint of the study, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection: median 16 weeks after BCG vaccine compared to 11 weeks after placebo administration. The incidence of a new infection during the 12-month period of follow-up after vaccination was also significantly decreased; the statistically significant hazard ratio (HR) of 0.55 corresponds to 45% reduction in the risk of a new infection in the BCG group compared to the placebo group (Figure 2A). The incidence of new infection was 42.3% (95% confidence intervals [CIs] 31.9%–53.4%) in the placebo group and 25.0% (95% CIs 16.4%–36.1%) in the BCG group. The difference in the incidence according to the type of infection showed most of the benefit on the prevention of respiratory infections of probable viral origin (Figure 2B); the HR in this case was 0.21 (95% CI 0.06–0.72) corresponding to 79% decrease in the risk for the BCG group in comparison to the placebo group. An analytical presentation of the efficacy of BCG vaccination for all primary and secondary study outcomes is shown in Table 2.Table 2Primary and Secondary Study OutcomesStudy OutcomePlacebo (N = 78)BCG (N = 72)Hazard Ratio (95% CI)p valueIncidence at least one new infection until month 12, no.

Sensitivity analysis was done for the total of 198 patients taking into consideration that the time of 12-month follow-up has not been completed for 48 patients (Figure 2C; Table S2). This sensitivity analysis confirmed the results of the primary outcome presented in Figure 2A. The confirmation of the primary endpoint of the interim analysis by the sensitivity analysis establishes the absence of any violations on the time-to-event analyses since individuals that are censored have the same probability of experiencing a subsequent event as individuals that remain in the study. The proportionality of the hazards over the total time period of follow-up was validated by plotting the Schoenfeld residuals (Figure S1). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that BCG vaccination was an independent protective factor from the incidence of new infection until month 12 (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.32–0.99; p = 0.048) (Table 3).Table 3Univariate and Multivariate Analysis of the Effects of Covariates on the Incidence of at Least One Infection until Month 12CovariatesNo. Infection (n = 99)At Least One New Infection (n = 51)Univariate AnalysisMultivariate AnalysisHR95% CIp valueHR95% CIp valueBCG vaccination, no.

A major benefit from BCG vaccination was observed in the main secondary endpoint patient-infections per year. This was 57.7 per 100 patients in the placebo group and 33.3 per 100 patients in the BCG group (p = 0.003) (Table 2). No difference in the other secondary endpoints was found between the two groups (Table 2; Figures S2 and S3).Figure S3Time to First Sepsis Episode after Placebo or BCG Vaccination, Related to Table 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a sub-group of 57 participants (31 placebo and 26 BCG vaccinated), we assessed production of innate immune responses at 2 time points (before and 3 months after vaccination) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Heterologous production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-10 (trained immunity induction) (Figures 3A–3E) but not of IL-6 (data not shown) by PBMCs after stimulation with non-mycobacterial ligands was amplified among BCG-vaccinated individuals compared to placebo-vaccinated individuals. A trend toward amplified interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (heterologous T cell responses) responses was also found (Figure 3F). Unfortunately, the number of BCG-vaccinated individuals in which cytokine data are available is too small to permit the prediction of trained immunity responses as correlates of protection. Various studies have shown that the increased cytokine responses upon BCG vaccination are the result of epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes (Arts et al., 2018Arts R.J.W. Moorlag S.J.C.F.M. Novakovic B. Li Y. Wang S.Y. Oosting M. Kumar V. Xavier R.J. Wijmenga C.

USA. 2012; 109: 17537-17542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). In order to examine potential differences in the epigenetic profile between BCG-vaccinated individuals and controls, we determined at pro-inflammatory genes the level of histone H3 acetylation at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), a mark of active promoters and enhancers. In line with previous findings, we observed increased levels of H3K27ac at the regions of IL-6 and TNF-α in BCG-vaccinated individuals as compared to individuals that received placebo, suggestive of epigenetic reprogramming upon BCG vaccination (Figure 3G). To further validate the solidity of the observation that BCG induces trained immunity responses in the elderly, we assessed immune responses before BCG vaccination, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination in 14 healthy volunteers aged 55 years or older that took part in an independent BCG-vaccination study (300BCG cohort, www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org). All individuals in this cohort were vaccinated with the same BCG strain used in the ACTIVATE trial and PBMCs were isolated and stimulated ex vivo with Staphylococcus aureus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, before and after vaccination to assess the magnitude of the immune memory responses. We observed a significant increase in IFN-γ upon stimulation with M. tuberculosis after BCG vaccination (Figure 3H), indicative of induction of adaptive immune memory response. In addition, cytokine production also significantly increased in the elderly when cells were exposed to non-mycobacterial stimuli such as S. aureus and LPS (Figure 3I; Figure S4A), indicative of induction of trained immunity. Furthermore, we observed long-term changes in neutrophil phenotype 3 months upon BCG vaccination as compared to baseline (Figure 3J). Together, these findings indicate sustained trained immunity responses in the elderly and support our previous observation of non-specific beneficial effects against unrelated infections in the elderly upon BCG vaccination. In addition, we employed a targeted proteome platform to measure 92 inflammatory markers before and after BCG vaccination, which revealed no significant changes in the concentrations of circulating inflammatory proteins, including IL-6 and IL-18 after BCG (Figure S4B; Table S3). Similarly, no significant changes in monocyte, granulocyte, or lymphocyte count were observed upon vaccination (Figures S4C–S4E). This demonstrates that, while BCG vaccination induces trained immunity and cell responsiveness, it is not followed by excessive systemic inflammation. A trend for lower serious adverse events was recorded in the BCG vaccination group than in the placebo group (Table 4). Moreover, the incidence of non-serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. None of the adverse events were related to the study intervention. None of the patients developed tuberculosis.Table 4List of Severe Adverse Events and Non-severe Adverse Events Reported during the Study PeriodSerious Adverse Events (SAEs)Placebo (N = 78)BCG (N = 72)p valuePresence of at least one SAE,aSome patients had more than one SAE and/or more than one AE. no.

Open table in a new tab SAEs and deaths due to infections counting against the primary endpoint are not encountered here since per protocol they should not be reported as adverse events. The ACTIVATE study was conducted from 2017 with the aim to assess the potential of BCG vaccination to protect the elderly with an increased risk for infection against new infectious episodes. As a target population we have chosen to investigate elderly patients returning home from a hospital admission, as it is known that this population is at a high risk to develop infections (Bender, 2003Bender B.S. Infectious disease risk in the elderly.Immunol. Allergy Clin. North Am. 2003; 23: 57-64, viAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This approach using BCG vaccination is justified due to the increasing number of experimental and epidemiological studies suggesting that BCG can protect against respiratory infections in general, and viral infections, in particular (Moorlag et al., 2019Moorlag S.J.C.F.M. Arts R.J.W. van Crevel R. Netea M.G. Non-specific effects of BCG vaccine on viral infections.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2019; 25: 1473-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Indeed, the data shown here demonstrate that BCG vaccination led to a lower number of infections of all causes, and especially respiratory tract infections, arguing for a protective effect. Epidemiological data suggest beneficial effects of BCG on all-cause mortality in children in countries with high infectious pressure. This protection has been attributed to lower incidence of neonatal sepsis and respiratory tract infections (Garly et al., 2003Garly M.L. Martins C.L. Balé C. Baldé M.A. Hedegaard K.L. Gustafson P. Lisse I.M. Whittle H.C. Aaby P. BCG scar and positive tuberculin reaction associated with reduced child mortality in West Africa. A non-specific beneficial effect of BCG?.Vaccine. 2003; 21: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which in children are often viral as etiological cause. This assumption is also supported by the data indicating protective effects of BCG vaccination against RSV infection (Stensballe et al., 2005Stensballe L.G. Nante E. Jensen I.P. Kofoed P.E. Poulsen A. Jensen H. Newport M. Marchant A. Aaby P.

The protection in children was also complemented more recently by studies showing protective effects of BCG vaccination against respiratory tract infections in adolescents (Nemes et al., 2018Nemes E. Geldenhuys H. Rozot V. Rutkowski K.T. Ratangee F. Bilek N. Mabwe S. Makhethe L. Erasmus M. Toefy A. et al.C-040-404 Study TeamPrevention of M. tuberculosis infection with H4:IC31 vaccine or BCG revaccination.N. Engl. J.

The efficacy of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccinations for the prevention of acute upper respiratory tract infection in the elderly.Acta Med. Indones. 2011; 43: 185-190PubMed Google Scholar). In line with this, the incidence of infection in the ACTIVATE trial was significantly lower in the elderly individuals vaccinated with BCG, compared to the non-vaccinated participants. Moreover, this protection was mainly due to respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin, with HR 0.21 in the BCG vaccinated group, which is in line with the 70%–80% reduction in respiratory tract infections in studies done in Indonesia and Japan (Ohrui et al., 2005Ohrui T.

ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack CitationsPermissions ShareFacebookTwitterLinked InMendeleyWechatReddit Figures \& Info Despite early exposure, its dense and aging population, and little social distancing measures, Japan reports low infection and low death from COVID-19. Here, we speculate on and discuss the possible reasons that may account for this anomaly. There is a lot of interest brewing as to why Japan has such low numbers of confirmed infected cases of the COVID-19 disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (Fig 1), despite its high population density (over 6,100 persons/sqkm in Tokyo, 2.4 times higher than New York City) and large percentage of high-risk individuals over 65 years of age (about 26%, compared with 15% in the USA). In Singapore and Hong Kong, rapid and strict quarantine rules and contact tracing have helped to “flatten the curve”. In South Korea, mass testing and quarantine measures appear to have reduced the rate of new cases. However, Japan has not engaged in expansive testing, contact tracing, or strict quarantine measures and yet is reporting a slow growth rate of infected persons and a death rate that is currently just 1/10th of world average. It is difficult to make direct comparison of infection rates, because the number of tests per capita varies dramatically between countries. However, this low death rate cannot be simply explained by lack of testing or reporting, as no surge in death from respiratory syndromes has been reported either. Figure 1. Cumulative number of cases, by number of days since February 1, 2020 Source: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#confirmed-covid-19-deaths-by-country, accessed 6-4-2020, data based on European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Download figure Download PowerPoint So how has Japan dealt with COVID-19? The Japanese Cluster Response Team of the Ministry of Health set forth on March 9th a three-pronged approach. early detection of and early response to infection clusters early patient diagnosis and enhancement of intensive care and the securing of a medical service system for the severely ill behavior modification of citizens (including advise to refrain from holding large-scale events, temporary school closures) Note that none of these involve strict social distancing measures taken by other countries. Why is this? What can we learn from Japan to help flatten the curve in other countries? Here, we discuss several hypotheses and provide arguments for or against each hypothesis. 1. Japanese culture is inherently suited for social distancing, and face mask use prevents viral spread. It is certainly true that the Japanese customs do not involve handshaking, hugging, or kissing when greeting. In addition, many Japanese wear cloth or paper face masks (not the N95 respirators required for exclusion of aerosol viral particles) in the winter to avoid transmission of respiratory infections. People use the mask to avoid spreading the infection and also in an attempt to prevent exposure to infection. However, we are unconvinced that this is the main or only reason why COVID-19 is so well contained in Japan. There is no social distancing in rush hour trains and buses, or when walking in crowded streets to school or to work. The use of face mask is also practiced in other Asian countries that witnessed higher rates of infection. A hint to whether this is a valid hypothesis comes from looking at other pandemic viral respiratory diseases. The community R0 rate for the 2009 pandemic flu for Japan was 1.28 while USA was 1.7–2.0 (Boelle et al, 2011). Thus, R0 in Japan was somewhat lower than the global median R0 of 1.47. In addition, an observational study of elementary school children in Japan found that wearing masks had significant protective association (odds ratio of 0.859, 95% confidence interval 0.778–0.949) against seasonal influenza (Uchida et al, 2017). Therefore, the social practice culture of Japan and mask use may explain to some extent the lower number of observed COVID-19 cases, but is unlikely the only explanation. 2. Japanese people were exposed to a milder version of SARS-CoV-2 that conferred herd immunity before the spread of a more virulent strain of CoV2. While possible, there is no current evidence that milder strains of SARS-CoV-2 exist. Nor do we know what sort of antibody response would develop as a result of exposure to such a hypothetical variant. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 of more than 3,500 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from around the world, including 29 from Japan, suggests that the outbreak in Japan was sparked by several independent virus introductions primarily from China (https://nextstrain.org/ncov?f_country=Japan, accessed 7.4.2020) (Hadfield et al, 2018). Furthermore, all of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are highly similar; most contain no more than 10 mutations compared to the virus that started the original outbreak. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the virus has evolved a significantly different phenotype, and even less likely that it was introduced early into Japan. Notably, early cases in Japan (January–February) were all linked to virus introduced from China. Now, in March, the outbreaks in Japan are linked to introductions from Europe, and there is a large gap in between those early introductions in January and the recent ones in March. While the data are still limited, this suggests that Japan was able to control the early outbreaks, keeping cases down, but is now experiencing a second wave introduced more recently from Europe. 3. Japanese people have reduced susceptibility due to ACE2 receptor expression. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells. It is theoretically possible that ACE2 expression in the respiratory tract is somehow lower in the Japanese population, though no direct evidence was identified during studies investigating coronavirus S-protein binding-resistant ACE2 mutants among different populations. If anything, East Asian populations were reported to have higher allele frequency in the ACE2 variants associated with higher ACE2 expression in tissues (Cao et al, 2020). However, the only way to find out whether the expression of ACE2 is indeed different is through surface protein staining of lung tissues, which has yet to be done. 4. Japanese people have distinct HLA that confers immune resistance to CoV2. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted on disease susceptibility show that HLA is usually the top locus associated with disease. This is true for infectious diseases, autoimmunity, or neurological disorders. HLA stands for human leukocyte antigen and is also known as MHC, or major histocompatibility complex. These genes encode for proteins that present antigenic peptides to T cells. HLA class I presents antigenic peptides to CD8 T cells, while HLA class II presents peptides to CD4 T cells. HLA genes are the most highly polymorphic genes in the human genome. The variety in HLA enables our immune system to survey for maximal number of antigen peptides that are present in pathogens, so as to elicit robust cellular immune responses. Previous studies have identified HLA-B*4601 to be associated with higher risk of developing SARS disease (Lin et al, 2003), based on a small number of cases. However, whether there are any HLA alleles that confer resistance to COVID-19 and whether the allele frequency is higher in the Japanese population are unknown. 5. BCG vaccine used in Japan confers protection against COVID-19. Japan, like many other countries including China, Korea, India, and the Russian Federation, have mandatory childhood BCG vaccines against tuberculosis. These countries have so far a relatively low per capita death rate from COVID-19 compared to countries that have no mandatory BCG vaccines (USA, Spain, France, Italy, The Netherlands). What further distinguishes Japan is that the BCG vaccine strain used in Japan, Brazil, and Russia is one of the original strains, while further modified BCG strains are used for vaccination in European countries. This association between BCG vaccination and apparent low COVID-19 incidence in Japan has spurred the idea that these two things may be linked (for more discussions on this topic, visit https://www.jsatonotes.com/2020/03/if-i-were-north-americaneuropeanaustral.html and https://news.yahoo.co.jp/byline/kimuramasato/20200405-00171556/). How would BCG, an attenuated bacterial vaccine completely unrelated to COVID-19, provide protection? Michai Netea and colleagues hypothesized that the vaccine may boost “trained immunity” (Netea et al, 2016)—in other words, certain immune stimuli may induce a prolonged state of resistance against pathogens in general, by elevating the expression levels of resistance factors. Studies have shown that receipt of BCG vaccine was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality within the first 1–60 months: The average relative risks were 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.49–1.01) from five clinical trials (Higgins et al, 2016). Furthermore, Netea and colleagues showed that BCG vaccination reduced the levels of viremia caused by the yellow fever virus live attenuated vaccine (Arts et al, 2018), and post-BCG increase of IL-1β production strongly correlated with lower viremia after yellow fever virus administration. A placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of 1,000 healthcare workers in The Netherlands has started, and a similar trial is planned to begin at the Max Planck Institute (de Vrieze, 2020). The outcomes of these trials will help us to understand whether and how BCG confers resistance to other pathogens including SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion There are many other theories to explain the low number of COVID-19 cases in Japan, yet we still do not have enough information to determine the cause of this striking discrepancy. Clearly, we do not understand what causes these differences. Many of these hypotheses can be tested as suggested above, such as examining ACE2 expression levels in the respiratory tract, GWAS data on COVID-19 susceptibility, and whether BCG vaccines indeed confer long-term innate immune resistance to SARS-CoV-2. The three-pronged approach by the Cluster Response Team of the Japanese Ministry of Health has thus far contained the spread of COVID-19 by quickly identifying clusters of infections, testing, and quarantine of the infected individuals. A word of caution is whether this approach will work in cases where super-spreaders ignite a large-scale transmission, or when there are multiple clusters that occur throughout the country at once. Perhaps one of the reasons for the low number of cases in Japan might relate to lack of super-spreader events to date. Just within the last 24 h, Japan has declared the state of emergency, as Tokyo faces more than 1,000 confirmed cases, more than double the number a week ago. Perhaps stronger social distancing measures are required to keep the curve flattened in Japan.

	abstract = {In January, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said his “greatest concern” was COVID-19 spreading in countries with fragile health systems. Although countries like India, Philippines, Thailand and Nepal have reported their first confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in January, widespread community spread have not been reported. Contrary to such justified expectations/predictions, on 13 March 2020, WHO declared Europe as the epicentre of the pandemic. Even though we are still in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the disproportionately smaller number of cases reported from disadvantaged/low-income countries remains puzzling. We hypothesize that general BCG vaccination policies adopted by different countries might have impacted the transmission patterns and/or COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality. Vaccines provide protection to a particular pathogen by inducing effector mechanisms directed to that pathogen. However, certain attenuated vaccines like the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) can also protect against unrelated pathogens, some of which cause acute respiratory tract infections.1,S1-S6 The underlying mechanism for the BCG vaccination-induced non-specific protection is thought to be mediated via the induction of innate immune memory, or “trained immunity,” as was first proposed by Netea and collaborators.2 Trained immunity-inducing agents reprogramme bone marrow haematopietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors through epigenetic and metabolic changes, resulting in a more robust response in differentiated innate immune cells, following encounter with a pathogen.S7-S8 Of interest, in a randomized placebo-controlled human study, BCG vaccination was demonstrated to induce epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes, conferring protection against experimental infection with an attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine strain.3 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that countries who continue BCG immunization programmes would contain the spread of this new coronavirus better than those who did not have or have ceased their national BCG vaccination programmes. To check the validity of this hypothesis, we compared the number of cases and deaths per million people from all countries with at least 500 (23 March) or 1000 cases (29 and 31 March) according to their BCG vaccination status (Figure 1A, B and Figure S1 (for updated data from 6 April) and Table S1). Cases/million in countries with a national BCG vaccination programme were statistically significantly lower than those who did not have/ have ceased their national BCG vaccination programmes (P < .0001). We also compared the number of deaths per million. Results showed that COVID-19-associated deaths relative to the size of the population were significantly lower in countries with a national BCG vaccination programme than those without BCG vaccination (P < .0058 and P < .0001 for 23, 29 and 31 March, respectively). To correct for different stages of the spread of disease, we downloaded the data showing the total confirmed deaths since the 5th death from Our World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-deaths-since-5th-death). Instead of the 5th death as day 0, we chose the 100th death as day 0. The total deaths on 14th or 20th day after the 100th death were divided by the population of each country to obtain deaths/million. All countries that had data on these days were included, and the comparison between the BCG-vaccinated and BCG-unvaccinated populations was made (Figure 1C). Using this “disease stage normalized” data, there was still a highly significant difference between countries that adhered to national BCG vaccination policy vs those that had ceases/never had a national programme (Figure 1C). If BCG vaccination has a general non-specific protective effect against spread of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality, then BCG re-vaccination of populations offer a viable alternative of partial protection until a specific vaccine is available. The duration of BCG-induced trained immunity or how different vaccine strains compare in terms of longevity of induced innate memory is not known. Work by Netea et al show that the “trained immunity status” is maintained for at least a year (the maximum time point they measured).S9 BCG-induced protection against tuberculosis lasts for approximately 20 years and wanes thereafter.S10 If one assumes that BCG-induced non-specific protective effect also lasts for 20 years and gradually wanes, then there should be a difference between countries that have stopped BCG vaccination earlier vs later. To assess this possibility, we analysed data from 13 European countries that have ceased their national BCG vaccination programmes (Table S2). According to this, 5 countries (Norway, France, Finland, UK and Germany) had ceased vaccination in the last 2 decades, whereas 8 countries had dropped national BCG vaccination in the last 3-4 decades (Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, Netherlands and Sweden) or had no national coverage (Italy, represented with an arbitrary value of 50). We then downloaded the data representing the daily confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million people from OUR World in Data website (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-daily-deaths-trajectory-per-million) for these 13 countries (Summarized in Table S3). We chose the deaths/million on day 7 of the epidemic (highlighted in bold in the Table S3) as the time point to compare the deaths/million between countries (ie before their health infrastructure was possibly overwhelmed). Our results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in deaths/million on day 7 since the daily confirmed deaths reached 0.1/million (Mann-Whitney U test; P = .0109) between countries that had ceased vaccination in the last 2 vs the last 3-4 decades (Figure 1D). This result suggests that BCG vaccination-induced heterologous non-specific protective effect could be of long-lasting duration (~20 years) and therefore could potentially impact the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2-associated community spread and/or disease severity. There is also the question of which BCG vaccine strain to choose. The BCG vaccine strains used by different countries vary widely. BCG vaccine was first introduced in 1921, and the seed cultures were distributed to various countries. During their passage, BCG strains accumulated genomic alterations, including deletions, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and duplications, leading to the emergence of several substrains.4 Based on their tandem duplication variants (DU2), BCG vaccines fall into 4 groups (Figure 2B). The DU2-I and DU2-II groups consists of “early” BCG vaccine strains (Japan, Russia and Moreau/Brazil), whereas DU2-III and DU2-IV are considered as more distant “late” vaccine strains (like Pasteur, Denmark and Connaught).4 The strains differ in terms of their growth characteristics, biochemistry, immunogenicity and virulence. The late BCG strains are defective in production of cell wall methoxymycolic acids and possess only the alpha and ketomycolic acids.5 Consistent with this, early BCG strains persist up to 6 months in the mesenteric lymph nodes of vaccinated children, whereas no live bacteria could be detected in late strain vaccines. Similarly, methoxymycolate-producing early strains are more potent immunostimulating agents than the late strains.6 Mycolic acids can condition macrophages to produce higher levels of IFN-γ, myeloperoxidase and TNF-α upon renewed exposure to innate triggers.7 Accordingly, mycolic acids constitute an important group of ligands capable of inducing trained immunity. Methoxymycolic acids are inflammatory and can activate macrophages, whereas ketomycolic acids promote anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated macrophages.7 Since the persistence and immunostimulatory properties of BCG strains differ, their potential to induce trained immunity in vaccinated individuals could also vary. When we analysed available data on BCG vaccine strains used in different countries (Figure 2A, modified from references 8 and 9), Iran and China emerged as local producers of their own vaccines. Evidence suggests that the BCG vaccine strain in Iran is BCG-Pasteur 1173p2S11 and the one in China is a strain derived from Glaxo 1077,S12 representing the most modified and highly attenuated strains deficient of methoxymycolic acids when compared to the Japan and Russia strains. It is conceivable that the trained immunity induced by the Iran and China BCG vaccine strains are short-lived compared to older strains widely utilized by other countries. The lower than expected number of cases detected in countries in Asia and Africa with extensive travel and trade links with China might stem from the BCG immunization-induced heterologous protective activity of the vaccine. Should this hypothesis hold its ground, then there would be important repercussions that could save lives. Since BCG vaccination was previously demonstrated to prevent acute respiratory tract infections even in the elderly, until a specific vaccine is developed, the results of clinical trials testing for BCG vaccine as defence against SARS-CoV-2 could be critical in the fight against the new coronavirus pandemic (list of ongoing/planned clinical trials are provided in Table S4).

However, vaccine-induced immune responses are highly variable between individuals and between populations in different regions of the world. Understanding the basis of this variation is, thus, of fundamental importance to human health. Although the factors that are associated with intra- and inter-population variation in vaccine responses are manifold, emerging evidence points to a key role for the gut microbiome in controlling immune responses to vaccination. Much of this evidence comes from studies in mice, and causal evidence for the impact of the microbiome on human immunity is sparse. However, recent studies on vaccination in subjects treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics have provided causal evidence and mechanistic insights into how the microbiota controls immune responses in humans. Vaccines are the most effective means available for preventing infectious diseases.

Much of this evidence comes from studies in mice, and causal evidence for the impact of the microbiome on human immunity is sparse. However, recent studies on vaccination in subjects treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics have provided causal evidence and mechanistic insights into how the microbiota controls immune responses in humans. Humans are inhabited by trillions of diverse microorganisms, known collectively as the microbiome. The terms microbiome and microbiota are often used interchangeably, with the former referring to the aggregate of genomes from all the microorganisms in the body and the latter referring to the specific microorganisms contained in the body. In addition to bacteria, the microbiota also consists of viruses, fungi, protozoa, and archaea (Pfeiffer and Virgin, 2016Pfeiffer J.K. Virgin H.W. Viral immunity. Transkingdom control of viral infection and immunity in the mammalian intestine.Science. 2016; 351: aad5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar; Robinson and Pfeiffer, 2014Robinson C.M. Pfeiffer J.K. Viruses and the microbiota.Annu. Rev. Virol. 2014; 1: 55-69Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microbiota performs a wide range of essential and beneficial functions, including controlling mucosal immunity, breaking down nutrients, and preventing pathogen colonization (Kundu et al., 2017Kundu P. Blacher E. Elinav E. Pettersson S. Our gut microbiome: the evolving inner self.Cell. 2017; 171: 1481-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The colonization of microbes starts at birth and continues through the first years of life, establishing a symbiotic relationship with the host that lasts a lifetime. The impact of the microbiota on the immune system is well established and has been reviewed elsewhere (Belkaid and Hand, 2014Belkaid Y. Hand T.W.

Research during the past decade using animal models has revealed a major impact of the microbiota on diverse physiological processes such as metabolism (Nicholson et al., 2012Nicholson J.K. Holmes E.

Abramson S.B. et al.Expansion of intestinal Prevotella copri correlates with enhanced susceptibility to arthritis.eLife. 2013; 2: e01202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The microbiota has also been linked to the efficacy of anti-programed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1)-based cancer immunotherapy (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2018Gopalakrishnan V. Spencer C.N. Nezi L. Reuben A. Andrews M.C. Karpinets T.V. Prieto P.A. Vicente D. Hoffman K.

Despite growing evidence of a connection between the microbiota and the immune system, its impact on immunity to vaccination remains poorly understood. Recent studies have demonstrated a profound impairment in vaccine-induced antibody responses during microbiota perturbation. Yet, much of this evidence comes from studies in animal models, such as germ-free mice or mice treated with antibiotics. Even though vaccines and antibiotics represent the most widely used and important public health interventions, surprisingly little is known about the interaction between them. In this review, we discuss the impact of the microbiota on vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. This review will primarily focus on gut bacteria, as this is by far the most studied aspect of the microbiota. First, we summarize the known knowns and known unknowns about how the microbiota, which is widely distributed in diverse tissues, can act locally or at distal sites in the body. Then, we discuss how vaccine efficacies vary in populations throughout the world and between individuals and consider the ways in which the microbiota could contribute toward this variation. Much of the experimental evidence for this comes from studies in mice and correlative studies in humans but establishing causality in humans has been challenging. However, emerging studies using systems vaccinology approaches to study vaccine responses in healthy humans that were given antibiotics are providing causal evidence for the role of the microbiota on human immunity (Hagan et al., 2019Hagan T. Cortese M. Rouphael N. Boudreau C. Linde C. Maddur M.S. Das J. Wang H. Guthmiller J. Zheng N.Y. et al.Antibiotics-driven gut microbiome perturbation alters immunity to vaccines in humans.Cell. 2019; 178: 1313-1328.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We discuss these studies and the mechanistic insights into how the microbiota controls the immune system. We conclude by considering the major challenges that need to be addressed to understand the complex and dynamic interplay between the human microbiota and the host response to vaccines, especially in the very young and the very old, and how this knowledge can be exploited to advance novel vaccines. Microbial communities are widely distributed in the gut, lung, skin, and other epithelial surfaces. The microbiota can influence host responses locally at the site, or act at a distance, and exercise profound systemic influence (Figure 1A). This, in turn, could potentially impact immune responses to vaccination. The mechanisms by which the microbiota exerts local or systemic effects are considered below. The alimentary canal presents a very diverse set of niches for colonization by the microbiota. Local interaction with the immune system primarily occurs in the small and large intestines, which harbor large numbers of B and T cells as well as antigen-presenting cells. These cells can detect many of the biomolecules produced by the microbiota, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (Macia et al., 2015Macia L. Tan J. Vieira A.T. Leach K. Stanley D. Luong S. Maruya M. Ian McKenzie C. Hijikata A. Wong C. et al.Metabolite-sensing receptors GPR43 and GPR109A facilitate dietary fibre-induced gut homeostasis through regulation of the inflammasome.Nat.

Wang X. Zeng B. Liu L. Tardivel A. Wei H. Han J. MacDonald H.R. Tschopp J. Tian Z. Zhou R. Recognition of gut microbiota by NOD2 is essential for the homeostasis of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 2465-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Some of these compounds are passively or actively transported across the epithelial lining of the gut and can be detected and acted upon by immune cells in the lamina propria. Antigen-specific immunity is generated by dendritic cells that continuously sample the intestinal lumen (Macpherson and Uhr, 2004Macpherson A.J. Uhr T. Induction of protective IgA by intestinal dendritic cells carrying commensal bacteria.Science. 2004; 303: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), and even simple bacterial cell adhesion to the gut epithelium has the potential to modulate the immune system (Atarashi et al., 2015Atarashi K. Tanoue T. Ando M. Kamada N. Nagano Y. Narushima S. Suda W. Imaoka A. Setoyama H. Nagamori T. et al.Th17 cell induction by adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells.Cell. 2015; 163: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Naturally, the responses to such stimuli are context dependent and have the potential to elicit complex changes in the gut immune system. Imprinting of the gut immune system by the microbiota might also affect its capabilities to respond to pathogens. The most commonly administered oral vaccines are live-attenuated versions of microorganisms that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, such as polio, cholera, typhoid fever, and rotavirus. Understanding the local interplay between gut microbiota and the immune system is vital to improve the efficacy of oral vaccines. Oral and systemic antibiotics can also have a profound effect on the gut microbiome and therefore potentially on responsiveness to (oral) vaccines. Consistent with this idea, low microbiota diversity early in life has been associated with differences in immune phenotype (Olin et al., 2018Olin A. Henckel E. Chen Y. Lakshmikanth T. Pou C. Mikes J. Gustafsson A. Bernhardsson A.K. Zhang C. Bohlin K. Brodin P. Stereotypic immune system development in newborn children.Cell. 2018; 174: 1277-1292.e14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) and differences in gut microbiota composition have been correlated to vaccine response (discussed below). Compared with the gut, the community of skin microbes is less diverse and are fewer in number. However, there is still communication with the skin immune system. Bacterial cues from the skin can trigger interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling (Naik et al., 2012Naik S. Bouladoux N. Wilhelm C. Molloy M.J. Salcedo R. Kastenmuller W. Deming C. Quinones M. Koo L. Conlan S. et al.Compartmentalized control of skin immunity by resident commensals.Science. 2012; 337: 1115-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and steer the recruitment of innate lymphoid cells (Kobayashi et al., 2019Kobayashi T. Voisin B. Kim D.Y. Kennedy E.A. Jo J.H. Shih H.Y. Truong A. Doebel T. Sakamoto K. Cui C.Y. et al.Homeostatic control of sebaceous glands by innate lymphoid cells regulates commensal bacteria equilibrium.Cell. 2019; 176: 982-997.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Identifying specific signals has been difficult, but the secretomes of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus provoked opposing effects on immune activation, indicating phylum-specific effects (Laborel-Preneron et al., 2015Laborel-Preneron E. Bianchi P. Boralevi F. Lehours P. Fraysse F. Morice-Picard F. Sugai M. Sato'o Y. Badiou C. Lina G. et al.Effects of the Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis secretomes isolated from the skin microbiota of atopic children on CD4+ T cell activation.PLoS One. 2015; 10: e0141067PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopeptides binding the Toll-like receptor-2/6 (TLR-2/6) heterodimer have also shown to be immunosuppressive in this context (Skabytska et al., 2014Skabytska Y. Wölbing F. Günther C. Köberle M. Kaesler S. Chen K.M. Guenova E. Demircioglu D. Kempf W.E. Volz T. et al.Cutaneous innate immune sensing of Toll-like receptor 2–6 ligands suppresses T cell immunity by inducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells.Immunity. 2014; 41: 762-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Microbiota-host interaction at the skin has the potential to modify immune function, as illustrated by the connection between the microbiota and various immune-related skin disorders (Stacy and Belkaid, 2019Stacy A. Belkaid Y. Microbial guardians of skin health.Science. 2019; 363: 227-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and could potentially impact immunity to vaccination. While the lungs were long believed to be sterile, sequencing-based methods and new techniques of bacterial cell culture have revealed that the luminal surface harbors a microbiota, albeit a less diverse one than that of the gut (Dickson et al., 2016Dickson R.P. Erb-Downward J.R. Martinez F.J. Huffnagle G.B. The microbiome and the respiratory tract.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2016; 78: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). So far, the live-attenuated influenza vaccine is the only vaccine administered through the intranasal route. However, several vaccines for respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are being developed (World Health Organization, 2020World Health OrganizationDraft landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines.https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccinesDate: 2020Google Scholar), and will require the appropriate quality and quantity of mucosal antibody response, and T cell response in the lung, to be effective. These mucosal responses could conceivably be influenced by the lung microbiota. For example, plasma cells and tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) in the lung may derive signals from lung bacterial products that enhance their survival and/or function. In this context, our recent study demonstrates that TRMs in the vaginal tissues provide signals to neighboring cells, including myeloid cells, to enhance antiviral responses in such cells (Arunachalam et al., 2020Arunachalam P.S. Charles T.P. Joag V. Bollimpelli V.S. Scott M.K.D. Wimmers F. Burton S.L. Labranche C.C. Petitdemange C. Gangadhara S. et al.T cell-inducing vaccine durably prevents mucosal SHIV infection even with lower neutralizing antibody titers.Nat. Med. 2020; 26: 932-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The extent to which the local microbiota could impinge on such TRM-innate interactions and whether such interactions are pervasive in other tissues remain to be seen. In addition to affecting their local milieu, microbes can also influence immune reactions in anatomical locations distal from the site of colonization. This can conceivably happen through several mechanisms (Figure 1B): (1) translocation of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from mucosal sites to the systemic circulation (Sandler and Douek, 2012Sandler N.G. Douek D.C. Microbial translocation in HIV infection: causes, consequences and treatment opportunities.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), (2) a “domino effect” mechanism, where signals from the microbiota are delivered to cells in the vicinity, which then circulate throughout the body and relay this information (perhaps through cytokines, metabolites, or other molecules), and (3) via dissemination of microbiota-derived metabolites (metabolite second messenger model). Consistent with this idea, microbiota-derived metabolites can be identified in various tissues and, thus, have the potential to be detected by the immune system at those sites (Uchimura et al., 2018Uchimura Y. Fuhrer T. Li H. Lawson M.A. Zimmermann M. Yilmaz B. Zindel J. Ronchi F. Sorribas M. Hapfelmeier S. et al.Antibodies set boundaries limiting microbial metabolite penetration and the resultant mammalian host response.Immunity. 2018; 49: 545-559.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Distal immune stimulation has been reported in various tissues such as the bone marrow (Clarke et al., 2010Clarke T.B. Davis K.M. Lysenko E.S. Zhou A.Y. Yu Y. Weiser J.N. Recognition of peptidoglycan from the microbiota by Nod1 enhances systemic innate immunity.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar; Shi et al., 2011Shi C. Jia T.

Bone marrow mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells induce monocyte emigration in response to circulating toll-like receptor ligands.Immunity. 2011; 34: 590-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), the liver (Li et al., 2017aLi F. Hao X. Chen Y. Bai L. Gao X. Lian Z. Wei H. Sun R. Tian Z. The microbiota maintain homeostasis of liver-resident γδT-17 cells in a lipid antigen/CD1d-dependent manner.Nat. Commun. 2017; 7: 13839Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, ), the peritoneum (Abt et al., 2012Abt M.C. Osborne L.C. Monticelli L.A. Doering T.A. Alenghat T. Sonnenberg G.F. Paley M.A. Antenus M. Williams K.L. Erikson J. et al.Commensal bacteria calibrate the activation threshold of innate antiviral immunity.Immunity. 2012; 37: 158-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), and the spleen (Kim et al., 2016bKim M. Qie Y. Park J. Kim C.H. Gut microbial metabolites fuel host antibody responses.Cell Host Microbe. 2016; 20: 202-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Bacterial antigens disseminated to the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes can trigger the production of IgG, which provides systemic protection against bacterial infection (Zeng et al., 2016Zeng M.Y. Cisalpino D. Varadarajan S. Hellman J. Warren H.S. Cascalho M. Inohara N. Núñez G. Gut microbiota-induced immunoglobulin G controls systemic infection by symbiotic bacteria and pathogens.Immunity. 2016; 44: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Another fascinating example of how the microbiota could act globally comes from recent studies that suggest that the response to HIV, and perhaps other viruses, could be imprinted by prior exposure to antigenically cross-reactive microbiota-derived antigens (Williams et al., 2018Williams W.B. Han Q. Haynes B.F. Cross-reactivity of HIV vaccine responses and the microbiome.Curr. Opin. HIV AIDS. 2018; 13: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Haynes and colleagues showed that HIV vaccine-induced CD4+ T and B cell responses could originate from a pool of intestinal cross-reactive immune cells. When they examined anti-HIV responses in ileum B cells and probed their relationship to commensal bacteria, remarkably, a majority (82%) of the ileum HIV anti-gp41 antibodies cross-reacted with commensal bacteria, and of those, 43% showed non-HIV-1 antigen polyreactivity (Trama et al., 2014Trama A.M. Moody M.A. Alam S.M. Jaeger F.H. Lockwood B. Parks R. Lloyd K.E. Stolarchuk C. Scearce R. Foulger A. et al.HIV-1 envelope gp41 antibodies can originate from terminal ileum B cells that share cross-reactivity with commensal bacteria.Cell Host Microbe. 2014; 16: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Vaccine efficacies can vary widely between individuals in a given region (Praharaj et al., 2015Praharaj I. John S.M. Bandyopadhyay R. Kang G. Probiotics, antibiotics and the immune responses to vaccines.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2015; 370: 20140144Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For example, the magnitude of hemagglutinin inhibition titers induced by vaccination with the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine can vary by more than 100-fold between individuals in a single cohort (Nakaya et al., 2015Nakaya H.I. Hagan T. Duraisingham S.S. Lee E.K. Kwissa M. Rouphael N. Frasca D. Gersten M. Mehta A.K. Gaujoux R. et al.Systems analysis of immunity to influenza vaccination across multiple years and in diverse populations reveals shared molecular signatures.Immunity. 2015; 43: 1186-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the magnitude of neutralizing antibody titers and CD8+ effector T cell responses induced by vaccination of humans with the live-attenuated yellow fever vaccine 17D, one of the most successful vaccines ever developed (Pulendran, 2009Pulendran B. Learning immunology from the yellow fever vaccine: innate immunity to systems vaccinology.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), can range more than 10-fold among individuals (Querec et al., 2009Querec T.D. Akondy R.S. Lee E.K. Cao W. Nakaya H.I. Teuwen D. Pirani A. Gernert K. Deng J. Marzolf B. et al.Systems biology approach predicts immunogenicity of the yellow fever vaccine in humans.Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Vaccine responses can also vary widely between people in different parts of the world. For example, the protection against tuberculosis by the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine varies from 0% to 80%, with a higher response rate in Europe than in Africa (Fine, 1995Fine P.E.

	abstract = {We propose the concept that administration of an unrelated live attenuated vaccine, such as MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), could serve as a preventive measure against the worst sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is mounting evidence that live attenuated vaccines provide nonspecific protection against lethal infections unrelated to the target pathogen of the vaccine by inducing "trained" nonspecific innate immune cells for improved host responses against subsequent infections. Mortality in COVID-19 cases is strongly associated with progressive lung inflammation and eventual sepsis. Vaccination with MMR in immunocompetent individuals has no contraindications and may be especially effective for health care workers who can easily be exposed to COVID-19. Following the lead of other countries conducting clinical trials with the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG (BCG) vaccine under a similar concept, a clinical trial with MMR in high-risk populations may provide a "low-risk-high-reward" preventive measure in saving lives during this unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.},

ToolsAdd to favoritesDownload CitationsTrack CitationsPermissions ShareFacebookTwitterLinked InMendeleyWechatReddit Figures \& Info The ongoing severe acute respiratory sickness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has resulted in more than 3,600,000 detected cases of COVID-19 illness and nearly 260,000 deaths worldwide as of May 6, 2020. Recently, BCG vaccination was shown to correlate with reduced COVID-19 case fatality rates (preprint: Miller et al, 2020; preprint: Sala \& Miyakawa, 2020; https://www.jsatonotes.com/2020/03/if-i-were-north-americaneuropeanaustral.html). The most recent data from publicly available resources also indicate that both COVID-19 incidence and total deaths are strongly associated with the presence or absence of national mandatory BCG vaccination programs. As seen in Table 1, seven of eight countries with very low numbers of total deaths (< 40 per 1 million population) adopted a mandatory BCG vaccination program using one of a set of 6 separate BCG strains (Table 1). In contrast, COVID-19 mortality was markedly higher in countries where BCG vaccination is not widely administered or is given only to high-risk groups. COVID-19 mortality was also higher in countries where widespread BCG vaccination was discontinued more than 20 years ago and in countries that used the BCG Denmark strain regularly or temporarily. This raises the question of whether BCG vaccination and reduced COVID-19 mortality are causally related. An additional question is why different BCG strains may be variably associated with mortality. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) is a live attenuated vaccine for tuberculosis (TB) that is given to infants intradermally shortly after birth. In addition to protecting against TB, BCG vaccination has been shown to exert heterologous immune effects to enhance protection against unrelated pathogens (Hirve et al, 2012). Based on clinical findings and experimental data, BCG is hypothesized to induce sustained changes in the immune system that result in heightened responses to infections at the level of innate and adaptive immunity (Mulder et al, 2019; Netea et al, 2020). In innate immune cells, BCG induces histone modifications and epigenetic reprogramming at the promotor sites of genes encoding inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This process has been termed “trained immunity” (Netea et al, 2020) (Table 1). Table 1.

The currently used BCG vaccine was initially produced at the Pasteur Institute, Paris, in 1921. The original vaccine strain was subsequently distributed to different laboratories worldwide and maintained by serial passage in each country. As shown in Fig 1, these strains can be classified as “early strains” and “late strains” depending on the timing of distribution. Notably, BCG strains that appear to be associated with lower COVID-19 mortality (e.g., BCG Japan and BCG Russia) are both early strains, whereas BCG Denmark, which seems to induce less protection against COVID-19, is a late strain.

Figure modified from Behr and Small (1999). Download figure Download PowerPoint While one study indicated that early and late BCG strains have comparable abilities to induce delayed-type immune responses against tuberculin (Table 2; Ladefoged et al, 1976), subsequent studies demonstrated that these strains differ genetically and phenotypically. First, a DNA fingerprinting study demonstrated that late strains such as BCG Denmark have evolved from early strains through genetic mutations (Behr \& Small, 1999; partially depicted in Fig 1). Another study indicated that, probably because of these mutations, late strains have lost expression of several membrane proteins including MPB64, MPB70, and MPB83. Moreover, cell wall-associated lipids including methoxy mycolate are absent in late strains, while phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIMs) and phenolic glycolipids (PGLs) are retained (Table 3; Chen et al, 2007; Liu et al, 2009). Another study showed that the early BCG Japan and BCG Russia strains both have much higher bacterial counts than the late strains (Table 4; WHO Technical Report, 1979), raising the interesting possibility that early strains may be richer than late strains in substance(s) that can stimulate immune responses associated with “trained immunity”.

Two studies evaluated BCG Japan and BCG Denmark for their ability to induce cytokine secretion in peripheral blood lymphocytes. One of these, conducted in Africa, showed that BCG Japan induced more robust proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, higher secretion of Th1 cytokines (interferon-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2) and lower secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4) compared with BCG Denmark (Davids et al, 2006). Another study conducted in Mexico showed that BCG Japan induced higher levels of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-24 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from vaccinated children compared with BCG Denmark (Wu et al, 2007). These results suggest that BCG Japan is more efficient than BCG Denmark in inducing the production of multiple types of inflammatory cytokines. While the exact mechanism of action remains unclear, these results collectively raise the interesting possibility that specific BCG strains such as BCG Japan may effectively induce immunity not only against M. tuberculosis but also unrelated pathogens. Thus, one could hypothesize that a particular BCG strain might preferentially act on the immune system in a manner that significantly reduces the morbidity/mortality associated with certain viral infections. However, data from both Finland and Australia seemingly contradict the hypothesis that early BCG strains confer resistance to COVID-19 morbidity. These countries ceased their universal BCG vaccination programs some years ago (2006 in Finland and mid-1980s in Australia), yet they show a low mortality of COVID-19 per 1 million population, compared with countries with current mandatory BCG vaccination (Table 1). Thus, BCG vaccination—if it does contribute to lower COVID-19 mortality—is clearly not the only factor. Two relevant traits shared by Finland and Australia are their excellent medical care systems and low population densities, and the latter of which could make social distancing measures more effective than in population-dense countries. Finally, all the abovementioned studies are observational, and no causal relationship has been substantiated yet between BCG vaccination and reduced numbers of severe and/or fatal COVID-19 cases. While some countries have begun clinical studies to determine whether BCG vaccination can protect healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 (not yet recruiting and recruiting clinical trials, with a total of over 10,000 participants—NCT04369794, NCT04350931, NCT04362124, NCT04348370, NCT04327206, NCT04347876, NCT04328441—ClinicalTrials.gov), small-scale clinical trials with limited numbers of participants are unlikely to provide a clear-cut answer. This is because < 10 of 1,000 individuals are expected to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 even in endemic countries such as Spain, Italy, and France (with incidence of 5,285, 3,485, and 2,584 cases per million population, respectively, as of March 4, 2020). Therefore, such studies are unlikely to document a definitive effect of BCG vaccination. Human challenge studies are another possibility, but ethical issues would prohibit many of these. Instead, given that ferrets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Kim et al, 2020), experimental verification of this hypothesis using animal models is warranted and feasible.

	abstract = {The rapid emergence of a highly pathogenic, readily transmissible coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, affecting millions and destabilizing economies. This catastrophe triggered a clarion call for the immediate deployment of a protective vaccine. We describe the unique challenges of developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a pandemic setting. The rapid emergence of a highly pathogenic, readily transmissible coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, affecting millions and destabilizing economies. This catastrophe triggered a clarion call for the immediate deployment of a protective vaccine. We describe the unique challenges of developing a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a pandemic setting. Historically, human coronaviruses have received limited attention from the research and medical communities. Although infections by human coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) frequently cause common cold symptoms in healthy individuals, severe clinical illness is relatively rare even in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and the elderly. Considerably more has been known about animal coronaviruses, leading to vaccines to prevent the infection of commercially important domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, and cattle). Experiments over many years with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic and hepatotropic coronavirus, have provided substantial insight into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and central nervous diseases, including multiple sclerosis. While these studies enhanced our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, only the recent explosive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans has sparked intense interest in developing countermeasures for human viruses in this family. In 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus emerged from bats and possibly civet cats in China. Within eight months, SARS-CoV spread to 27 countries around the world, resulting in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (de Wit et al., 2016de Wit E. van Doremalen N. Falzarano D. Munster V.J. SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). An unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organizations, limited transmission and human disease. Ten years later, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. As observed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the Arabian Peninsula (∼2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). Serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have been discovered. Sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (Graham et al., 2013Graham R.L. Donaldson E.F. Baric R.S. A decade after SARS: strategies for controlling emerging coronaviruses.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 836-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). An appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as efforts to develop vaccines. In this Forum, we discuss how the prior study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the fundamental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. Accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response. SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus first isolated in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (Zhou et al., 2020Zhou P. Yang X.L. Wang X.G. Hu B. Zhang L. Zhang W. Si H.R. Zhu Y. Li B. Huang C.L. et al.A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.Nature. 2020; 579: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (12911) Google Scholar). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (Guan et al., 2020Guan W.J. Ni Z.Y. Hu Y. Liang W.H. Ou C.Q. He J.X. Liu L. Shan H. Lei C.L. Hui D.S.C. et al.China Medical Treatment Expert Group for Covid-19Clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in China.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2002032Crossref Scopus (18405) Google Scholar). The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from COVID-19. Virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and the United States and epicenters in large urban cities. Most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 April 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at ∼4%. The extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. Rapid implementation and deployment of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return. Coronaviruses are round, ∼120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (S) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. Three additional viral structural proteins (envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), together with a lipid membrane and ∼25–31 kilobase viral genome, comprise the virion (Figure 1A; de Wit et al., 2016de Wit E. van Doremalen N. Falzarano D. Munster V.J. SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). The M and E proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the S protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. Interactions between the M glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. The small structural E protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. The nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle. The S protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (de Wit et al., 2016de Wit E. van Doremalen N. Falzarano D. Munster V.J. SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar). In some circumstances, the S protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [HA], HIV-1 [gp160], and Ebola [glycoprotein, GP]). This class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments, followed by further processing of S2 to yield a smaller S2′ protein. Cleavage also may occur during viral egress. The S1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), whereas the carboxyl terminal S2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. The structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5Å using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the SARS-CoV S protein (Figure 1B; Wrapp et al., 2020Wrapp D. Wang N. Corbett K.S. Goldsmith J.A. Hsieh C.L. Abiona O. Graham B.S. McLellan J.S. Cryo-EM structure of the 2019-nCoV spike in the prefusion conformation.Science. 2020; 367: 1260-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the RBD. The application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. For example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for Zika virus (ZIKV) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. Several vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, many focused on the S protein, have been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (Zhou et al., 2018Zhou Y. Jiang S. Du L. Prospects for a MERS-CoV spike vaccine.Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2018; 17: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although multiple platforms of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine candidates were evaluated in human trials (e.g., viral vectored [NCT03615911 and NCT04170829], DNA plasmid [NCT00099463], and inactivated virus [NCT00533741]), none advanced beyond phase 1 safety studies. Similarly, no vaccines have been developed against other human coronaviruses. Within months of publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, work began on dozens of vaccine candidates (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1), enabled by insights from the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine development and well-characterized vaccine antigen expression platforms, including those shown to be safe in humans. Several vaccines, described below, have entered phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate safety in small numbers of subjects (Table 1). However, given the lack of established and tractable pre-clinical disease models of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, these vaccines have advanced to human trials without data in animals establishing efficacy against COVID-19.Table 1Vaccine Candidates in Development against SARS-CoV-2Vaccine TypePlatformProtein TargetStageClinical Trial DesignationCompany or InstitutionVaccine NameStatusmRNALipid-encapsulated mRNASPhase 1NCT04283461 (45 subjects)ModernamRNA-1273RecruitingDNADNA plasmidSPhase 1NCT04336410 (40 subjects)Inovio PharmaceuticalsINO-4800RecruitingHuman adenovirus (Ad5)Viral-vectoredSPhase 1NCT04313127 (108 subjects)CanSino BiologicsAd5-nCoVActiveChimpanzee adenovirusViral-vectoredSPhase 1/2NCT04324606 (510 subjects)University of OxfordChAdOx1 nCoV-19Planned (4/20)Spike proteinBacterially produced soluble protein (oral)SPhase 1NCT04334980 (84 subjects)Symvivo CorporationbacTRL-SpikePlanned (4/30)BCG vaccineImmune stimulatoryNonePhase 3NCT04327206 (4170 subjects)NCT04328441 (1000 subjects)Murdoch Childrens Research InstituteUniversity Medical Center, NetherlandsBCG vaccineRecruitingInformation adapted from https://ClinicalTrials.gov.

This technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus (NCT03076385 and NCT03345043) and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including ZIKV. Developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in collaboration with Moderna, mRNA-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mRNA expressing a prefusion-stabilized S protein. The design of the S protein antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class I fusion proteins of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses (Pallesen et al., 2017Pallesen J. Wang N. Corbett K.S. Wrapp D. Kirchdoerfer R.N. Turner H.L. Cottrell C.A. Becker M.M. Wang L. Shi W. et al.Immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion MERS-CoV spike antigen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E7348-E7357Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). These studies identified stabilizing proline substitutions in the central helix of S2 that reduced the fusion activity and allowed high-level expression of trimeric S in an antigenically native prefusion context. The structure of the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 has been solved (Figure 1B). A phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1273 (NCT04283461) was initiated in March of 2020 as an open-label, dose-ranging study in 45 subjects who were administered the vaccine in two doses 29 days apart. Subjects will be followed for 12 months following the second dose for safety, with immunogenicity as a secondary objective. INO-4800 is a DNA plasmid vaccine candidate encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals. A similar approach was evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials as a vaccine for MERS-CoV and was shown to be immunogenic (GLS-5300; NCT02670187). Three doses of GLS-5300 elicited S-protein-binding antibodies in a majority (94%) of vaccinated individuals, although neutralizing antibodies were observed less frequently (50% of subjects) and titers waned substantially during the course of study follow-up (Modjarrad et al., 2019Modjarrad K. Roberts C.C. Mills K.T. Castellano A.R. Paolino K. Muthumani K. Reuschel E.L. Robb M.L. Racine T. Oh M.D. et al.Safety and immunogenicity of an anti-Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus DNA vaccine: a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation trial.Lancet Infect. Dis. 2019; 19: 1013-1022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Vaccine-elicited, MERS-CoV-specific T cell responses also were detectable in most recipients. These experiences informed the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate INO-4800, which is now being evaluated in an open-label phase 1 clinical trial. Volunteers will receive two doses of DNA administered intradermally by electroporation 28 days apart. Adenovirus (Ad) vectors, derived from multiple species, have been employed to deliver vaccine antigens for multiple infectious disease targets. Multiple Ad-vectored SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines have been characterized in preclinical models. These vaccines elicited both humoral and cellular coronavirus-reactive responses and protected against infection. A simian Ad vector expressing the MERS-CoV S protein is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04170829). A phase 1/2 study to explore the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using this platform has been initiated by investigators at the University of Oxford (NCT04324606). A similar approach using the human Ad5 serotype is being tested by Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and CanSino Biologics Inc. (NCT04313127). Multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease (Table 1). BCG is a live-attenuated isolate of Mycobacterium bovis delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). Multiple studies in humans and mice suggest BCG administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections (Moorlag et al., 2019Moorlag S.J.C.F.M. Arts R.J.W. van Crevel R. Netea M.G. Non-specific effects of BCG vaccine on viral infections.Clin. Microbiol. Infect. 2019; 25: 1473-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of BCG-mediated cross protections may include enhanced Th1 and Th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or “trained immunity” in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection. Despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting, there remain substantive challenges for implementation due, in part, to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts. This approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years (e.g., influenza, dengue [DENV], and respiratory syncytial viruses) for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses. While multiple vaccine platforms against SARS-CoV-2 focus on the S protein, questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response. (1) Will neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection? Do protective responses require antibody targeting of specific epitopes? Is there a threshold neutralizing antibody response that protects against SARS-CoV-2? (2) Do some of the assays commonly used in vitro to measure neutralization (e.g., pseudotyped viruses) faithfully predict protective activity in vivo? (3) What is the role of non-neutralizing anti-S antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells? Could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via Fc-γ-receptor interactions? (4) What is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination? (5) Are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames (ORFs) important for immunity, especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly? And (6) how important are CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection? While some of this information can be gleaned from pre-clinical and early vaccine trials with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, how certain are we that these correlates of protection will transfer to the pandemic SARS-CoV-2? The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity. Indeed, a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity. Pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389), likely because mouse ACE2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 (Letko et al., 2020Letko M. Marzi A. Munster V. Functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for SARS-CoV-2 and other lineage B betacoronaviruses.Nat. Microbiol. 2020; 5: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice that express human ACE2 (hACE2-Tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing. Beyond this, pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models (e.g., ferrets and hamsters) still are in early stages of development. Safety is the primary consideration of any vaccine development program, given the anticipated administration to large numbers of people. Beyond the expected reactogenicity profiles, studies with other distantly and closely related coronaviruses have raised concerns that humoral vaccine responses might potentiate SARS-CoV-2 infection via immune enhancement mechanisms. Immune enhancement might occur via at least two distinct mechanisms, detailed below. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing Fc-γ or complement receptors. ADE of DENV infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of DENV or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal DENV-immune IgG. ADE is an obstacle for DENV-vaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by DENV-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine Dengvaxia. Through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (Vennema et al., 1990Vennema H. de Groot R.J. Harbour D.A. Dalderup M. Gruffydd-Jones T. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. Early death after feline infectious peritonitis virus challenge due to recombinant vaccinia virus immunization.J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1407-1409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cell culture experiments, SARS-CoV entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-S antibodies through both Fc-γ-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (Jaume et al., 2011Jaume M. Yip M.S. Cheung C.Y. Leung H.L. Li P.H. Kien F. Dutry I. Callendret B. Escriou N. Altmeyer R. et al.Anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike antibodies trigger infection of human immune cells via a pH- and cysteine protease-independent FcγR pathway.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 10582-10597Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, Wan et al., 2020Wan Y. Shang J. Sun S. Tai W. Chen J. Geng Q. He L. Chen Y. Wu J. Shi Z. et al.Molecular mechanism for antibody-dependent enhancement of coronavirus entry.J. Virol. 2020; 94: e02015-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ADE assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo. This may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ADE assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. The inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many in vitro assays, reduces enhancement in an IgG subclass-dependent manner. ADE has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of DENV infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral T cells. Coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. Is the infection of Fc-γ-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to COVID-19 disease severity? Studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. For DENV, the most compelling evidence for a role of ADE in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans. A second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. Enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a Th2-directed T cell response (Ruckwardt et al., 2019Ruckwardt T.J. Morabito K.M. Graham B.S. immunological lessons from respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development.Immunity. 2019; 51: 429-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. While preclinical studies of multiple SARS-CoV vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar Th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (Bolles et al., 2011Bolles M. Deming D. Long K. Agnihothram S. Whitmore A. Ferris M. Funkhouser W. Gralinski L. Totura A. Heise M. Baric R.S. A double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge.J. Virol. 2011; 85: 12201-12215Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. Based on recent progress in RSV vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion S epitopes together with a Th1 T cell response may be key features of a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. This traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. Although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. Against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. However, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. Studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. In this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.},

Previous versions: May 22, 2020: Ahead of Print Although hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, have been proposed for treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),1 their potential cardiovascular toxicities had limited consideration in this new clinical environment. We aimed to determine whether these drugs were associated with an increased reporting of cardiovascular (CV) adverse drug reactions (ADR) in a real-world population, before start of prescription for COVID-19 in Europe and America.In this observational, retrospective study, we used VigiBase,2,3 the World Health Organization pharmacovigilance database encompassing more than 21 million reports from more than 130 countries, to compare CV-ADR reporting in patients who received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or their combination with CV-ADRs reported with all other drugs in the full database (clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT04314817). Association between hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination with CV-ADR was assessed using reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC), an indicator value for disproportionate Bayesian reporting that compares observed and expected values to find associations between drugs and ADR.2 The lower end of the IC’s 95% credibility interval is IC025. It is considered significant when above 0.2 Reporting odds ratios were computed to compare ADR frequencies between different exposures, using χ2 tests.3 These methods are similar to those used to study CV-ADR related to anticancer and hormonal drugs.2,3 For each report, age, sex, time to onset (TTO), fatalities, concurrent ADRs, and medications (drugs associated with a known or possible risk of QT prolongation as reported at crediblemeds.org)4 were collected. TTO were compared using nonparametric tests. The French National Commission for Data Protection and Liberties and institutional review board approved the use of confidential electronically processed patient data. All CV-ADRs were included, classified by group queries,2 according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, between November 14, 1967, and March 1, 2020.We extracted 76 822 ADR cases associated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 89 692 with azithromycin alone, and 607 with the combination of both drugs. The cases were retrieved from 21 275 867 total ADR reports in VigiBase. Hydroxychloroquine was a suspected (versus concomitantly used) drug in 21 808/76 822 (28.4%) cases and azithromycin in 54 533/89 692 (60.8%) cases.There was significant greater reporting of prolonged-QT (LQT) and/or ventricular tachycardia including Torsades-de-Pointes (TdP/VT) for each drug individually in suspected cases (n=480 [223 LQT; 257 TdP/VT], IC025=1.67 for azithromycin and n=136 [53 LQT; 83 TdP/VT], IC025=1.04 for hydroxychloroquine; Figure). Hydroxychloroquine was also associated with conduction disorders (atrioventricular and bundle-branch blocks; n=75, IC025=1.04) and heart failure (n=203, IC025=0.06). No other CV-ADR (including cardiac ischemia and myocarditis)2 was significantly associated with these drugs.

Time to onset data are available for hydroxychloroquine and LQT and/or TdP/VT (n=90), for hydroxychloroquine and conduction disorders (n=77), for hydroxychloroquine and heart failure (n=94), and for azithromycin and LQT and/or TdP/VT (n=70). Statistics:2 IC = log2[(Nobserved + 0.5)/(Nexpected + 0.5)], where Nexpected = (Ndrug × Nreaction)/Ntotal, with Nexpected being the number of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) expected for the drug-ADR combination; Nobserved being the actual number of ICSRs observed for the drug-ADR combination; Ndrug being the number of ICSRs for the drug, regardless of ADR; Nreaction being the number of ICSRs for the ADR, regardless of the drug; and Ntotal being the total number of ICSRs in the database.Azithromycin monotherapy was associated with a greater reporting of LQT and/or TdP/VT than hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (736/89 085 [0.8%] versus 263/76 215 [0.3%], respectively; reporting odds ratio, 2.36 [95% CI, 2.05–2.71). The combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater reporting of LQT and/or TdP/VT reporting than either drug in monotherapy (999/165 300 [0.6%] versus 9/607 [1.5%], reporting odds ratio, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.28–4.79]).Most CV-ADRs reports were in women (516/772, 66.8%). Reporting regions were mostly Americas (549/851, 64.5%) and Europe (185/851, 21.7%). Reporters were mostly healthcare professionals (674/706, 91.1%). In most cases, ADR was attributed to a single drug (492/844, 58.3%). Concurrent reporting of drugs with a known risk of TdP in TdP/VT cases was 31.5% (81/257) with azithromycin and 16.9% (14/83) with hydroxychloroquine.4TTO of LQT and/or TdP/VT with azithromycin was shorter compared with hydroxychloroquine (3 [interquartile range=1;7] versus 51 [IQR=11;113] days, P<0.01). With hydroxychloroquine, TTO of LQT and/or TdP/VT was shorter than heart failure (51 [IQR=11;113] versus 348 [IQR=91;2016] days, P=0.027). This longer TTO observed in hydroxychloroquine may reflect chronic use in lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.The proportion that resulted in death for TdP/VT cases was 8.4% (7/83) with hydroxychloroquine and 20.2% (52/257) with azithromycin versus 0% (0/53) and 5.4% (12/223) for LQT without TdP/VT with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, respectively (P<0.001 for both). The corresponding death rate was 20.7% (42/203) for heart failure associated with hydroxychloroquine. The dose of hydroxychloroquine was higher in heart failure compared with LQT and/or TdP/VT cases (200 [IQR=200;400] versus 200 [IQR=200;200] mg/d, P=0.033).The main limitation is that without data on numbers exposed in VigiBase, this work cannot assess the incidence or risk for QT prolongation with these drugs. However, our results are consistent with the facts that these CV-ADRs are found in the US Food and Drug Administration’s labels of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and that both drugs are referenced as having a known risk of TdP on the CredibleMeds website.4 These CV-ADRs are important to bear in mind in the setting of COVID-19 with patients presenting additional risk factors of LQT/TdP caused by inflammation with elevated interleukin-6, hypokalemia, numerous interacting drugs, bradycardia, and higher hydroxychloroquine dosages.5In conclusion, reports of potentially lethal acute cardiac proarrhythmogenic effects leading to ventricular arrhythmias have been described mainly with azithromycin but also with hydroxychloroquine. Their combination yielded an even stronger signal. Hydroxychloroquine was also associated with potentially lethal heart failure when exposure was prolonged over several months.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Banook group/Cardiabase, Nancy–France http://www.banookgroup.com/ (Yasmin Khan) for providing the Holter and ECG systems to evaluate prospectively the impact of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on ventricular arrhythmia in a current cohort of treated patients with COVID-19, as a follow-up study of this work.

	abstract = {Coronaviruses, seven of which are known to infect humans, can cause a spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe illness and death. Four human coronaviruses (hCoVs)—229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43—circulate globally, commonly infect children and typically cause mild upper respiratory tract infections. Three novel coronaviruses of zoonotic origin have emerged during the past two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the recently discovered severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These novel coronaviruses are known to cause severe illness and death predominantly in older adults and those with underlying comorbidities. Consistent with what has been observed during the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, children with COVID-19 are more likely to be asymptomatic or to have mild-to-moderate illness, with few deaths reported in children globally thus far. Clinical symptoms and laboratory and radiological abnormalities in children have been similar to those reported in adults but are generally less severe. A rare multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) which has resulted in critical illness and some deaths has recently been described. Clinical trials for therapeutics and vaccine development should include paediatric considerations. Children may play an important role in the transmission of infection and outbreak dynamics and could be a key target population for effective measures to control outbreaks. The unintended consequences of the unprecedented scale and duration of pandemic control measures for children and families around the world should be carefully examined.Abbreviations: 2019-nCoV, 2019 novel coronavirus; ADEM, acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis; AAP, American Academy of Pediatrics; ACE-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; BCG, bacillus Calmette–Guérin; BNP, brain natriuretic peptide; CDC, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CRP, C-reactive protein; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; CT, computed tomography; CXR, chest X-ray; DOL, day of life; hCoV, human coronavirus; ICU, intensive care unit; IL, interleukin; IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin; KD, Kawasaki disease; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MERS, Middle East respiratory syndrome; MERS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; MEURI, monitored emergency use of unregistered and experimental interventions; MIS-C, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PICU, paediatric intensive care unit; RNA, ribonucleic acid; RCT, randomised-controlled trial; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV-1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1; SARS-CoV-2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; TNF-alpha, tumour necrosis factor alpha; UK United Kingdom; UNICEF, United Nations Children’s Fund; USA, United States of America; WHO, World Health Organization},

Further, BCG vaccination is being considered for clinical trials aiming to test its potential for lowering COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. This article illustrates some structural and functional relationships that may gather these drugs and the author, basing on a combined pathophysiological and pharmacological approach, recommends the FDA-approved antidiarrhea drug; nitazoxanide, which has been previously suggested but unfortunately widely ignored, to be tested in combination with azithromycin for their potential activity against SARS CoV-2, soonest. The author also recommends testing their combined administration as early during the clinical course of COVID-19 as possible. Further, basing on the same represented concept, the author suggests more trials for interferons to be tested against SARS CoV-2, especially in severe and critical COVID-19 cases.},

BCG vaccination trials for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection are underway, but concerns have been raised regarding the potential harm of strong innate immune responses. To investigate the safety of BCG vaccination, we retrospectively assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related symptoms in three cohorts of healthy volunteers who either received BCG in the last 5 years or did not. BCG vaccination is not associated with increased incidence of symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. Our data suggest that BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.58, p < 0.05), and lower incidence of extreme fatigue. In conclusion, recent BCG vaccination is safe, and large randomized trials are needed to reveal if BCG reduces the incidence and/or severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection.},

As of 29 April 2020, a total of 997 COVID-19 trials were registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, of which more than 30 are investigating the effects of lopinavir and ritonavir.Lopinavir is the main antiviral agent, whereas ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic “booster” that increases lopinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting cytochrome 3A4 enzymes (1). The combination is an approved antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV-1 infection. However, in vitro data also suggest antiviral activity of lopinavir against SARS-CoV-1, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 4.1 µg/mL; Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV, with an EC50 of 10.8 µg/mL; and, only recently, SARS-CoV-2, with an EC50 of 16.4 µg/mL (2). Importantly, the EC50 for HIV-1 is 0.07 µg/mL, more than 200-fold lower than for SARS-CoV-2 (1). Recently, Cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral loads (3).Objective: To measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with COVID-19.Methods and Findings: In this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of COVID-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Patients with concomitant intake of relevant CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. Patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. Assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. Analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in HIV trials, which makes the data comparable.Trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/mL (median, 13.6 µg/mL) (Table). Interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with C-reactive protein (Spearman correlation coefficient rS = 0.81). All patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. Specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.Table. Lopinavir and Ritonavir Trough Concentrations in Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19Discussion: We report the first pharmacokinetic data of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Lopinavir trough levels were approximately 2-fold higher in our population than in patients with HIV receiving the same dose (7.1 µg/mL) (1). This may have been caused by inflammation-induced downregulation of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity and reduced drug metabolism, which is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (4). The observed correlation of drug concentrations with C-reactive protein, a downstream marker of IL-6, supports this hypothesis and is notable because C-reactive protein levels were not exceedingly high in our population. High levels of IL-6 are associated with disease severity (5), and IL-6–blocking therapies are being investigated in several clinical trials. Thus, drug metabolism may be even more impaired in more severe cases of COVID-19. Furthermore, clinicians should be aware that anti-inflammatory treatments may severely affect the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome enzyme–dependent drugs.This analysis has limitations. Only trough levels were quantified, and more detailed pharmacokinetics were not available. Also, there are no data on the half-maximal effective dose of lopinavir for SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.Currently, more than 30 trials of lopinavir and ritonavir treatment of COVID-19 are registered, and according to ClinicalTrials.gov, doses range from 200 to 400 mg of lopinavir and from 50 to 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily (the patients in our analysis received the latter dose for each drug). Unfortunately, lopinavir is almost completely bound by plasma proteins, and only 1% to 2% are free and active (1). To translate drug concentrations in vitro to unbound (and therefore active) concentrations in vivo, a correction for protein binding is required (1, 2). Unbound drug concentrations of lopinavir are far from reaching the EC50 of SARS-CoV-2 (16.4 µg/mL), although they clearly suffice to inhibit HIV-1.In conclusion, despite the approximately 2-fold higher lopinavir trough concentrations in our sample of patients with COVID-19 compared with patients with HIV, approximately 60- to 120-fold higher concentrations are required to reach the assumed EC50 at trough levels, making effective treatment of COVID-19 with lopinavir and ritonavir at the currently used doses unlikely.References1.

Trough total concentrations (i.e. the value measured on a blood sample collected just before drug administration) are 3 to 4 times higher than the values reported in HIV patients treated with the same dosage regimen (1, 2), suggesting over-exposure in COVID-19 patients. These values have prompted clinicians to reduce the dose or even stop treatment. Unfortunately, using total concentration as a marker of exposure for highly bound drugs is a well-known pharmacokinetic mistake (3), repeated once again for COVID-19 patients. Lopinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (>98%), mainly to α1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) and to a lesser extent to albumin (1). Since AAG concentrations are highly elevated during acute inflammation in COVID-19 patients, higher bound and total lopinavir exposure are expected while unbound exposure remains unchanged (4). Therefore, measuring unbound lopinavir concentrations is critical for drug dosage adjustment. On the other hand, the crucial information remains the drug concentration at the infectious site (i.e. the lung). Unfortunately, this information is not available. A lung biopsy would appear to be the most informative approach. However, in such fragile and unstable patients, this option would be highly intrusive. An alternative approach is to evaluate lopinavir concentration in the lung epithelial lining fluid (ELF). This information was available for two critically ill COVID-19 patients from Toulouse University Hospital (France) (60 and 64 years old, BMI at 36 and 20, and SAPS II at 43 and 38 respectively). They presented severe ARDS and were intubated. The ELF (0.47; 3.88 mg/l) and plasma concentrations (8.86; 7.75 mg/l) were available 15 and 8 days after the treatment initiation, with a ratio of 0.05 and 0.5 respectively. In both cases, ELF values were lower than the EC50 (26 µM or 16.3 mg/l) reported for SARS-CoV-2 (4). Even if our data are very sparse, they could help to explain the failure of lopinavir to reduce the SARS-CoV2 viral load as already discussed (5) and suggest that increasing the lopinavir dose to reach effective lung concentrations is necessary but at the cost of more side effects. 1.

Thus, we appreciate that the authors shared their interesting data which confirm the lopinavir plasma concentrations found in our patients (1), but also demonstrating lopinavir concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (ELF). These data, support our conclusion that lopinavir concentrations are far from reaching effective concentrations to conquer SARS-COV-2. However, ELF drug concentrations should only be interpreted with caution, because of well-known methodological issues (2). To interpret any concentrations in ELF its concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid has to be calculated. This is mostly done by quantification of urea, because it is a small, non-polar molecule which can diffuse freely across membranes. The concentration of urea is therefore assumed to be equal in plasma and in ELF, while the instilled fluid during BAL is free of urea (3), so that the dilution may easily be calculated. However, it is important to note that this method is frequently inaccurate, because urea concentrations in BAL may be affected by various factors including the “dwelling time”, during which urea may diffuse into the instilled fluid (3). Thus, ELF volume is frequently overestimated. Also drug concentrations may be over-estimated by intracellular drug contents of lysed cells. Moreover, the protein concentration in ELF needs to be considered, which may vary substantially depending on vascular permeability and the local or systemic inflammatory response (3). Total protein concentrations in ELF are much lower compared to whole blood, but may increase significantly during inflammation (3, 4) and manifold in pneumonia (5). Thus, the degree of protein binding in ELF (or lung tissue) is difficult to estimate, but also has to be considered to draw any definitive conclusions. Possibly further validation of analytical methods may also be necessary. Importantly, the median trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir of 13.6µg/mL, and for that matter also the presented ELF drug concentrations, are below the EC50 for SARS-COV-2 even without adjustment for protein binding. Hence, based on these considerations effective treatment of COVID-19 with lopinavir at the currently used doses seems highly unlikely. References: 1.

	abstract = {As the SARS-CoV-2 virus wreaks havoc on the populations, health care infrastructures and economies of nations around the world, finding ways to protect health care workers and bolster immune responses in the general population while we await an effective vaccine will be the difference between life and death for many people. Recent studies show that innate immune populations may possess a form of memory, termed Trained Immunity (TRIM), where innate immune cells undergo metabolic, mitochondrial and epigenetic reprogramming following exposure to an initial stimulus that results in a memory phenotype of enhanced immune responses when exposed to a secondary, heterologous, stimulus. Throughout the literature, it has been shown that the induction of TRIM using such inducers as the BCG vaccine and -glucan can provide protection through altered immune responses against a range of viral infections. Here we hypothesize a potential role for -glucan in decreasing worldwide morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19, and posit several ideas as to how TRIM may actually shape the observed epidemiological phenomena related to COVID-19. We also evaluate the potential effects of -glucan in relation to the immune dysregulation and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. Ultimately, we hypothesize that the use of oral -glucan in a prophylactic setting could be an effective way to boost immune responses and abrogate symptoms in COVID-19, though clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy of this treatment and to further examine differential effects of -glucan’s from various sources.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccine provides protection against tuberculosis (TB), and is thought to provide protection against non-TB infectious diseases. BCG vaccination has recently been proposed as a strategy to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 (CoV-2) to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, supported by its potential to boost innate immunity and initial epidemiological analyses which observed reduced severity of COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccination policies. Seventeen clinical trials are currently registered to inform on the benefits of BCG vaccinations upon exposure to CoV-2. Numerous epidemiological analyses showed a correlation between incidence of COVID-19 and BCG vaccination policies. These studies were not systematically corrected for confounding variables. We observed that after correction for confounding variables, most notably testing rates, there was no association between BCG vaccination policy and COVD-19 spread rate or percent mortality. Moreover, we found variables describing co-morbidities, including cardiovascular death rate and smoking prevalence, were significantly associated COVID-19 spread rate and percent mortality, respectively. While reporting biases may confound our observations, our epidemiological findings do not provide evidence to correlate overall BCG vaccination policy with the spread of CoV-2 and its associated mortality.},

	abstract = {One of the striking features emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic has been the early recognition of ethnic disparities in both vulnerability to contracting the disease, as well as its outcome. These disparities were first reported in news outlets (Blow, 2020; Cowan, 2020; Godin, 2020; The Guardian, 2020a) and, more recently, verified in academic journals (e.g., Bhala, Curry, Martineau, Agyeman, \& Bhopal, 2020; Khunti, Singh, Pareek, \& Hanif, 2020; Laurencin \& McClinton, 2020; Webb Hooper, Nápoles, \& Pérez-Stable, 2020), as well as through organizations responsible for gathering health statistics (eg, APM Research Lab, 2020; CDC, 2020; ICNARC, 2020; ONS, 2020). In particular, Black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have emerged as more susceptible to higher morbidity and mortality than either UK or USA white groups. The Office for National Statistics (ONS)—the central organization responsible for producing demographic statistics in the UK—recently stated that Blacks were over four times more likely than whites in England and Wales to die from COVID-19, figures that were equivalent across both genders. The ONS statistics included both confirmed and suspected cases of COVID-19, as well as deaths in hospitals and the community. Similarly, in the USA, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has reported that almost twice as many Black and Hispanic individuals were hospitalized with COVID-19 than are proportionally represented in the community (CDC, 2020). From a biocultural perspective, it has been heartening to witness an early recognition in both the UK and the USA that inter-population variation in susceptibilities to corona virus lies not in biology or our genes, but mostly in social and structural differences between human groups that have often led to health disparities (Bhala et al., 2020; Webb Hooper et al., 2020) (see Figure 1). The existence of such disparities is commonly referred to in anthropological and related literatures as “structural violence” (Farmer, Nizeye, Stulac, \& Keshavjee, 2006; Galtung, 1969). Such considerations of structural inequalities in health have, for the most part, dominated emerging reports rather than questions of genes, ethnicity or(particularly, in North American parlance) the contested word “race” (Fuentes et al., 2019). For example, when socioeconomic factors as well as preexisting health conditions were controlled for in the ONS (2020) study cited above, the mortality risk for Blacks was reduced, but remained almost twice as high as whites, and higher for males (raising questions of course about what explains the residual differences); the figures for South Asians were similar (ONS, 2020). The ONS, at the time, was not able to include the types of jobs held by individuals among the confounders, which they argue could also affect their models. However, more recently, insidious and potentially racist allusions are beginning to emerge appearing to blame African Americans as somehow responsible for the relatively large number of cases and deaths from COVID-19 in the USA, stoking age-old tropes, and attributing morbidity and mortality to the behaviors and predispositions of BAME groups (Guardian, 2020b; Strings, 2020). The Guardian (2020b) has speculated about the political motivations behind these attributions. In reality, structural or social inequalities that affect individual vulnerabilities to SARS-CoV-2 include exposures through types of employment, whether people are working in essential transport networks carrying large numbers of people, or in small grocery shops that place BAME communities at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 (Figure 1). These communities are also frequently at higher risk for metabolic disorders including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, some of which are linked to higher risks for contracting COVID-19, and poorer outcomes once contracted (Azkur et al., 2020). Given that mortality appears to result more from the inflammatory response engendered from exposure to COVID-19, as well as its ability to attack many organs in the body, metabolic diseases render many individuals at high risk for adverse outcomes once they become ill (Matricardi, Dal Negro, \& Nisini, 2020). Front-line health workers are also at high risk for contracting COVID-19. In England, the National Health Service (NHS) has long imported qualified doctors, nurses, and carers from abroad (now 13% of all staff), and proportionally twice as many BAME individuals work for the NHS as in the rest of the economy (Baker, 2019). A recent report also suggested that BAME health workers have had less access to personal protective equipment than their white European counterparts (Royal College of Nursing, 2020). In the USA, there are additional social problems faced by minority groups, such as the potential lack of health care due to costs of health insurance. This is a problem that BAME groups do not face in the UK with its national health service. In addition, BAME communities often live in neighborhoods classified as food deserts which affect access to healthy foods, or they lack green spaces for exercise and fresh air. Ethnic minorities frequently live in areas or regions that are more polluted than others, situations which can be exacerbated by lack of service provision including garbage collection. These kinds of “structural violence” are common for ethnic minorities in many northern nations, and can mostly explain inter-group susceptibility to COVID-19. Nevertheless, are there potentially any underlying biological realities that could also render some groups more vulnerable to poorer outcomes after contracting the disease? There are clearly differences in susceptibility based on both age and gender that remain little understood, at present, and that are not wholly due to either social or behavioral differences. In addition, there may be variation in the way that some individuals respond to drugs—so-called pharmacogenetic differences—that might explain recovery times or reactions to particular pharmaceutical interventions (Shah, 2005). Just as some individuals appear immune to HIV-AIDS (Carrington et al., 1996), similarly some individuals may also, for unknown reasons, be immune to SARS-CoV-2, or are asymptomatic carriers (Azkur et al., 2020). There have been a few attempts to explore these underlying biological issues in relation to SARS viruses. One example is the study of population differences in genetic polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, found in many human organs such as the lung, brain, kidney, heart and gut, and through which related corona viruses (SARS-CoV-1, and the more recent SARS-CoV-2) binds to the new host, primarily through lung entry. Although East Asians appear to have higher expression of ACE2 levels compared to people of European descent, there does not seem to be any association between genetic variants and COVID-19 outcome (Cao et al., 2020). Similarly, Nguyen et al. (2020) performed an in silico analysis of different classes of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes for their response to exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and also mapped different HLA variants globally to estimate the potential epidemiological impact at the population level. Again, while one HLA variant appeared to confer greater protection, another might render an individual more susceptible to COVID-19, but neither were suggested to have an impact at a global level. More recently, Genomics England (2020) has announced that they will begin a study of 20 000 hospitalized patients who have experienced the worst symptoms of COVID-19, and will compare them to 15 000 patients who have had only mild symptoms, in an effort to explore potential genomic differences in susceptibility to the disease. The study will undoubtedly take some time to complete, and it is not known how the research will either collect or address other risk factors alongside genetic variability. Similarly, the Biobank longitudinal study in the UK has requested its current participants to enroll in a subsidiary study to examine those factors (genetic or otherwise) that could influence susceptibility to COVID-19 (Biobank, 2020), although the proportion of BAME individuals participating in Biobank is lower than in the national population (Fry et al., 2017).Other physiological reasons for differential ethnic susceptibility to COVID-19 have been suggested, including the potential of Vitamin D deficiency to increase susceptibility which would adversely affect people with darker skin living in countries at higher latitudes; this connection has since been downplayed (Hamiel, Kozer, \& Youngster, 2020). We should also remember that developmental and epigenetic influences mediated through the environment (socioeconomic and otherwise) can also impact individuals in later life and, through this route, affect their susceptibility to pathogens (Conching \& Thayer, 2019; Nelson, 2009; Wells, 2016). South Asians, for example, are suggested to have a particular thin-fat phenotype in response to long-standing conditions of fetal under-nutrition that render them particularly vulnerable to metabolic disorders in later life (Yajnik et al., 2003. These phenotypic traits also appear to be inter-generationally preserved (van Steijn et al., 2009) and, as mentioned above, are currently linked to risks for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality (Azkur et al., 2020). Life course events such as allostatic load also seem to affect the rate at which individuals age biologically, such that their biological age is higher or lower than their chronological age. These discrepancies have been measured using a variety of techniques such as analyses of telomerelength, or epigenetic age, and many ethnic minorities appear to have higher biological ages relative to their chronological ages (eg, Levine \& Crimmins, 2014; Simons et al., 2016). Given that COVID-19 vulnerability is positively correlated with age, those individuals with a higher biological age might also be increasingly susceptible to the effects of COVID-19. More broadly, at a wider geographical level, long-standing differences between countries in terms of Gross Domestic Product, infra-structure and histories of colonial oppression, are thought to make many southern hemisphere, lower and middle-income countries (LMICs) much more vulnerable to the emerging spread of corona virus and its health consequences (Bhutta, Basnya, Saha, \& Laxminarayan, 2020; Roberton et al., 2020). There has also been speculation about the potentially catastrophic consequences of poor health, crowded conditions, lack of sufficient health personnel, and inability to socially distance in most of the camps housing refugees in various parts of the world (Kassem, 2020; Nott, 2020). The statistics, in fact, looked encouraging early on, in that the numbers of cases and deaths appeared much lower in LMICs than in Europe, although the African Continent has been temporally behind Europe in exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (Hashim, 2020). In South Asia, the lower mortality rate was variably assigned to the demographic structure of the population, with a majority of younger individuals who may have been less likely to transmit SARS-CoV-2 (Hashim, 2020). In addition, it was speculated that exposure to more diseases during early life, or a more intense pattern of childhood immunizations, might somehow prime individuals to be more resistant to the virus. Early reports, however, that there might be some protection afforded by theBacillus Calmette-Guérin(BCG) vaccination against tuberculosis (which was also routinely given to most children in the UK until 2005) have since been questioned (Kumar \& Meena, 2020; Redelman-Sidi, 2020). Another factor that might shield refugee camps from the pandemic is that they remain relatively isolated from tourist and visitor trails, while travel by inmates outside the camps is often restricted (Abdalfatah, 2020). However, more recently, the pandemic has been accelerating in southern countries, with rapidly increasing rates in the African Continent and in South Asia, providing challenges to the health care systems in many countries (Johns Hopkins University, 2020; Vaidyanathan, 2020), and an ominous portent of what might be the ultimate morbidity and mortality rates in LMICs. Finally, and by no means least in relation to structural inequalities, as we develop new potential treatments and vaccines to treat COVID-19, we must also be aware of the need to test and gather data on ethnic minorities, who are generally poorly represented in clinical trials and longitudinal health cohort studies (Jackson \& Kuhlman, 2019). The study of health in relation to structural inequalities, racism, and so-called “racial medicine” has often been the focus of anthropology (eg, Conching \& Thayer, 2019; Ifekwunigwe et al., 2017; Weigmann, 2006).We should be reassured, barring selective political rhetoric that has the potential to be extremely damaging, by the evident recognition in press outlets, popular science sources, and elsewhere, that ethnic inequalities in health do not reflect underlying human biology or genes, but rather the social environment in which human individuals find themselves embedded. We can only hope that the current pandemic might be an eventual catalyst to addressing and remediating these inequalities after decades of increasingly widening inequality gaps within human societies (Dorling, 2013; Marmot, 2015).

	abstract = {Abstract The reasons for a wide variation in severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the affected countries of the world are not known. Two recent studies have suggested a link between the BCG vaccination policy and the morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. In the present study we compared the impact of COVID-19 in terms of case fatality rates (CFR) between countries with high disease burden and those with BCG revaccination policies presuming that revaccination practices would have provided added protection to the population against severe COVID-19. We found a significant difference in the CFR between the two groups of countries. Our data further supports the view that universal BCG vaccination has a protective effect on the course of COVID-19 probably preventing progression to severe disease and death. Clinical trials of BCG vaccine are urgently needed to establish its beneficial role in COVID-19 as suggested by the epidemiological data, especially in countries without a universal BCG vaccination policy.},

However, these studies obtained data during the early phase of the pandemic and did not adjust for potential confounders, including PCR-test numbers per population (PCR-tests). Currently—more than four months after declaration of the pandemic—the BCG-hypothesis needs reexamining. An ecological study was conducted by obtaining data of 61 factors in 173 countries, including BCG vaccine coverage (%), using morbidity and mortality as outcomes, obtained from open resources. ‘Urban population (%)’ and ‘insufficient physical activity (%)’ in each country was positively associated with morbidity, but not mortality, after adjustment for PCR-tests. On the other hand, recent BCG vaccine coverage (%) was negatively associated with mortality, but not morbidity, even with adjustment for percentage of the population ≥ 60 years of age, morbidity, PCR-tests and other factors. The results of this study generated a hypothesis that a national BCG vaccination program seems to be associated with reduced mortality of COVID-19, although this needs to be further examined and proved by randomized clinical trials.},

Although there were five Phase I human vaccine trials against SARS and MERS, the lack of data in humans provided us with limited benchmarks that could help us design a new vaccine for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, we showcase the similarities in structures of virus components between SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 in areas relevant to vaccine design. Using the ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) databases, we shed light on the 16 current approved clinical trials worldwide in search for a COVID-19 vaccine. The different vaccine platforms being tested are Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccines, DNA and RNA-based vaccines, inactivated vaccines, protein subunits, and viral vectors. By thoroughly analyzing different trials and platforms, we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using each type of vaccine and how they can contribute to the design of an adequate vaccine for COVID-19. Studying past efforts invested in conducting vaccine trials for MERS and SARS will provide vital insights regarding the best approach to designing an effective vaccine against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The objectives of these two separate trials are: (1) to reduce health care workers (HCWs) absenteeism; and (2) to reduce hospital admission among the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic through BCG vaccination.Two separate multi-centre placebo-controlled parallel group randomized trials PARTICIPANTS: (1) Health care personnel working in the hospital or ambulance service where they will take care of patients with the COVID-19 infection and (2) elderly ≥60 years. The HCW trial is being undertaken in 9 hospitals. The elderly trial is being undertaken in locations in the community in Nijmegen, Utrecht, and Veghel, in the Netherlands, using senior citizen organisations to facilitate recruitment.For both trials the intervention group will be randomized to vaccination with 0.1 ml of the licensed BCG vaccine (Danish strain 1331, SSI, Denmark, equivalent to 0.075 mg attenuated M. bovis). The placebo group consists of 0.1 ml 0.9% NaCl, which is the same amount, and has the same colour and appearance as the suspended BCG vaccine.(1) Number of days of unplanned work absenteeism in HCWs for any reason which can be continuously measured on a bi-weekly basis, and (2) the cumulative incidence of hospital admission due to documented COVID-19.Participants will be randomized to BCG vaccine or placebo (1;1) centrally using a computer- based system, stratified by study centre.Subjects, investigators, physicians and outcome assessors are blinded for the intervention. Only the pharmacist assistant that prepares- and research personnel that administers- study medicines are unblinded. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): (1) The sample size for the first trial is N=1500 HCWs randomised 1:1 to either BCG vaccine (n=750) and placebo (n=750) and (2) The sample size for the second trial is N=1600 elderly persons randomised to BCG vaccine (n=800) and the placebo group (n=800).HCW: version 4.0, 24-04-2020.

Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of “trained immunity” or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 epidemiological data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity—a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp. (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations—is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality. We seek to draw attention toward the inclusion of controls for underlying “trained immunity” and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be preexisting or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning potential benefit from them.},

COVID-19 badly affects countries that did not have universal immunization policies or having them only for the selective population of countries (highly prominent population) like Italy, USA, UK, Netherland, etc. Universal immunization of BCG can provide great protection against the COVID-19 infection because the BCG vaccine gives broad protection against respiratory infections. BCG vaccine induces expressions of the gene that are involved in the antiviral innate immune response against viral infections with long-term maintenance of BCG vaccine-induced cellular immunity. COVID-19 cases are reported very much less in the countries with universal BCG vaccination policies such as India, Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Israel, Japan, etc. as compared to without BCG implemented countries such as the USA, Italy, Spain, Canada, UK, etc. BCG vaccine provides protection for 50–60 years of immunization, so the elderly population needs to be revaccinated with BCG. Several countries started clinical trials of the BCG vaccine for health care workers and elderly people. BCG can be uses as a prophylactic treatment until the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine.},

Some of these interventions can also stimulate the adaptive T- and B-cell responses, but our main focus is on the innate part of immunity. We divide the reviewed interventions into: 1) lifestyle related (exercise, >7 h sleep, forest walking, meditation/mindfulness, vitamin supplementation); 2) Non-specific immune stimulants (letting fever advance, bacterial vaccines, probiotics, dialyzable leukocyte extract, pidotimod), and 3) specific vaccines with heterologous effect (BCG vaccine, mumps-measles-rubeola vaccine, etc).For each of these interventions we briefly comment on their definition, possible mechanisms and evidence of clinical efficacy or lack of it, especially focusing on respiratory tract infections, viral infections, and eventually a reduced mortality in severe respiratory infections in the intensive care unit. At the end, a summary table demonstrates the best trials supporting (or not) clinical evidence.Several interventions have some degree of evidence for enhancing the innate immune response and thus conveying possible benefit, but specific trials in COVID-19 should be conducted to support solid recommendations.},

	abstract = {Abstract Objectives: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against tuberculosis is associated with non- specific protective effects against other infections, and significant reductions in all-cause morbidity and mortality have been reported. We aim to test whether BCG vaccination may reduce susceptibility to and/or the severity of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases in health care workers (HCW) and thus prevent work absenteeism. The primary objective is to reduce absenteeism due to illness among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary objectives are to reduce the number of HCW that are infected with SARS-CoV-2, and to reduce the number of hospital admissions among HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hypothesis: BCG vaccination of HCW will reduce absenteeism by 20% over a period of 6 months. Trial design: Placebo-controlled, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial, recruiting study participants at several geographic locations. The BCG vaccine is used in this study on a different indication than the one it has been approved for by the Danish Medicines Agency, therefore this is classified as a phase III study. Participants: The trial will recruit 1,500 HCW at Danish hospitals. To be eligible for participation, a subject must meet the following criteria: Adult (≥18 years); Hospital personnel working at a participating hospital for more than 22 hours per week. A potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study: Known allergy to components of the BCG vaccine or serious adverse events to prior BCG administration Known prior active or latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) or other mycobacterial species Previous confirmed COVID-19 Fever (\&gt;38 C) within the past 24 hours Suspicion of active viral or bacterial infection Pregnancy Breastfeeding Vaccination with other live attenuated vaccine within the last 4 weeks Severely immunocompromised subjects. This exclusion category comprises: a) subjects with known infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) b) subjects with solid organ transplantation c) subjects with bone marrow transplantation d) subjects under chemotherapy e) subjects with primary immunodeficiency f) subjects under treatment with any anti-cytokine therapy within the last year g) subjects under treatment with oral or intravenous steroids defined as daily doses of 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for longer than 3 months h) Active solid or non-solid malignancy or lymphoma within the prior two years Direct involvement in the design or the execution of the BCG-DENMARK-COVID trial Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomised to BCG vaccine (BCG-Denmark, AJ Vaccines, Copenhagen, Denmark) or placebo (saline). An adult dose of 0.1 ml of resuspended BCG vaccine (intervention) or 0.1 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution (control) is administered intradermally in the upper deltoid area of the right arm. All participants will receive one injection at inclusion, and no further treatment of study participants will take place. Main outcomes: Main study endpoint: Days of unplanned absenteeism due to illness within 180 days of randomisation. Secondary study endpoints: The cumulative incidence of documented COVID-19 and the cumulative incidence of hospital admission for any reason within 180 days of randomisation. Randomisation: Randomisation will be done centrally using the REDCap tool with stratification by hospital, sex and age groups (+/- 45 years of age) in random blocks of 4 and 6. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Blinding (masking): Participants will be blinded to treatment. The participant will be asked to leave the room while the allocated treatment is prepared. Once ready for injection, vaccine and placebo will look similar, and the participant will not be able to tell the difference. The physicians administering the treatment are not blinded. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): Sample size: N=1,500. The 1,500 participants will be randomised 1:1 to BCG or placebo with 750 participants in each group. Trial Status: Current protocol version 5.1, from July 6, 2020. Recruitment of study participants started on May 18, 2020 and we anticipate having finished recruiting by the end of December 2020. Trial registration: The trial was registered with EudraCT on April 16, 2020, EudraCT number: 2020-001888-90, and with ClinicalTrials.gov on May 1, 2020, registration number NCT04373291.

Recent estimates have recalculated the burden of global influenza. Each year, one billion people are affected by influenza, with a high rate of hospitalization. Deaths associated with respiratory disease from influenza are between 290,000 and 645,000. Cardiovascular disease deaths, which are estimated to represent about half of deaths due to the complications of influenza, must also be considered [2].From a public health point of view, the adult or elderly cancer patient presents the same comorbidities as the general population, which increases with age. It is estimated that more than 20% of the population aged 65 and over have at least two comorbidities, a percentage that reaches more than 50% in people aged at least 75 years of age [3]. Patients with malignancies are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications, with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than healthy cohorts. In several studies conducted during the 2009–2010 influenza pandemic, high rates of hospitalization, pneumonia and death (9.5%) were reported among oncological patients [4].Although annual vaccination against influenza infection is recommended, vaccination rates among cancer patients are apparently low [5]. Few patients with a diagnosis of a malignant disease are advised about influenza vaccination by their treating oncologist. The main reasons for influenza vaccination denial are concerns about interaction with the malignant disease, with cancer treatment and potential side effects [6].A recent Cochrane revision reported lower mortality and infection-related outcomes with influenza vaccination, with limited value to support the benefit of vaccination in cancer patients, due to the small number of studies. According to the current evidence, it seems that the benefits of vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza outweigh the potential risks. However, additional placebo or no treatment arms in randomized controlled trials of influenza vaccination among adults with cancer are ethically questionable [7].In addition to traditional vaccines produced in embryonated hen’s eggs, innovative vaccines are currently available, such as the vaccine produced using a seed virus propagated exclusively in cell culture, the recombinant influenza vaccine manufactured in insect cells and the inactivated mammalian cell-grown vaccine [8]. Manufacturing influenza virus vaccines using a mammalian cell line rather than embryonated chicken eggs may carry certain advantages. First, they overcome the difficulty of growing influenza viruses, in particular the subtype A/H3N2, in embryonated hen’s eggs. Second, they help avoid adaptive mutations of the virus in the course of vaccine production. Finally, they accelerate timelines for vaccine composition to keep up with the pace of rapid wild virus evolution and respond to potential future pandemics [8]. The potential benefits deriving from these new products could be translated into a more effective influenza vaccination. Moreover, such new techniques will provide basic knowledge for further studies on host-related immune factors and new vaccine formulations (higher doses, use of cell-based or recombinant systems for a single antigen, etc.) and may also help to develop more targeted vaccination strategies against the groups at greatest risk, such as cancer patients.Cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade: a special populationAs we previously reported in a systematic review, there are no solid data supporting the efficacy of influenza vaccination in the subgroup of cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [9]. Despite some evidence of good seroconversion rates following influenza vaccination during ICI, which were higher when compared with both those of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and even of healthy subjects [10,11], prospective data about safety, clinical efficacy and possible interactions of the flu vaccine with anticancer therapy is still largely unknown. In our opinion, serological efficacy is insufficient to support the routine administration of annual influenza vaccination for ICI-treated patients. Looking for explorative data, our group conducted the INVIDIa study, which was the first retrospective study reporting results about clinical efficacy and compatibility of influenza vaccination with ICI therapy [12,13]. Soon after, other similar retrospective analyses [14,15] and limited prospective experiences [16,17] were reported in the literature. Considering these studies all together, the evidence related to influenza vaccination during ICI therapy in cancer patients is still scarce and controversial and there is a need for more robust data about safety and efficacy in this population.Given this unmet clinical need, a multicenter observational trial (the INVIDIa-2 study) is currently collecting prospective data during the 2019–2020 flu season at more than 80 oncology centers in Italy, aiming to provide for recommendations on influenza vaccination in cancer patients treated with ICIs. The INVIDIa-BIOS ancillary study will also investigate, in a large INVIDIa-2 patient subgroup, the immunological background of the immune response to vaccination during ICI, as well as the immune response to ICI during vaccination, with the aim of identifying unexplored immunological interactions.Immunological insightsThe immunological balance during immune checkpoint blockadeThe immune system is a complex network of cells and soluble mediators dedicated to the maintenance of organism integrity. This means not only defending the body from the attacks of external pathogens, but also from possible internal sources of danger (i.e., tumors). This is also known as ‘immune surveillance’ and it is fundamental for the elimination of cancerous cells before they can grow and give rise to tumor masses. Immune surveillance can be impaired due to the action of immune regulatory cells or due to mechanisms induced by the tumor itself and/or cells of tumor stroma, leading to tumor growth [18–20]. The T-cell response is regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals, called ‘immune checkpoints’. Under normal physiological conditions, immune checkpoints are crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance but also for the protection of tissues from immune-mediated damage when the immune system is responding to exogenous antigens with excessive intensity and/or duration. These immune checkpoints are also involved in the impairment of immunity against tumors, thus have been used as targets for antitumor immune therapy. Treatment with ICIs removes inhibitions in the way between the recognition of tumor antigens and the killing of cancerous cells. The blockade of a general immune-regulatory mechanism not only favors the effector phase of the immune-response against cancer, but in general drives the balance between immune regulation and immune activation in favor of activation. This altered balance can lead the immune response toward autoimmunity, known to be one of the major concerns of ICI treatment.Influenza vaccination/infection in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapyThe immunological balance described above can also result in hyperactivation of a physiological immune response after vaccination during ICI therapy, along with a subsequent immune reaction once the host encounters the wild virus he was vaccinated against. In fact, in normal conditions, the vaccine stimulates both T and B cells, providing a protective humoral immunity with poor involvement of the cellular response during the second exposition to the antigen. In the absence of mechanisms related to the regulation of T-cell activation (as seen during ICI therapy), the second encounter of the antigen (i.e., flu infection after flu vaccination) can lead to the generation of T-cell-driven systemic inflammations, which are responsible for the appearance of the clinical symptoms of flu infection in vaccinated subjects [21]. This paradoxical immunological phenomenon could underlie the higher rate of influenza infection among vaccinated cancer patients receiving ICI, as reported by the INVIDIa retrospective study [12]. On the other hand, the immune hyperactivation after flu vaccination and/or influenza syndrome in patients treated with ICIs may exert a direct positive effect on antitumor immunity, as suggested by the increase in overall survival in vaccine/virus exposed subjects in the same study ([13], submitted manuscript). In this regard, it is well known how the activation of the immune system against a foreign pathogen may awaken the antitumor immunity via the presence of pathogens associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pathogens associated molecular patterns, pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentially vaccine adjuvants not only activate the response against a pathogen’s antigens, but also against a tumor’s antigens via a ‘bystander’ mechanism. The first report of this dates to WB Coley, now considered the initiator of cancer immunotherapy. At the end of 1800, he reported the case of a patient affected by an inoperable osteosarcoma of the neck that completely healed from the tumor after a spontaneous local erysipelas infection. After this observation, he published a case series of ten patients affected by tumor, treated with germs obtained by erysipelas infections, now known to be the Streptococcus pyogenes [22]. In 1974, Zbar and Rapp described how to obtain an antitumor effective Bacillus Calmette–Guérin, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, which then resulted in the effective intravesical treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [23]. Nowadays, the identification of a safe and effective immune adjuvant for the stimulation of antitumor immunity is a primary aim of the immunology research. A fundamental aspect of the bacterial-mediated antitumor therapy is the administration of the microorganism/adjuvant at the tumor site, in order to activate APCs and other cells of the immune system at the tumor level and in draining lymph nodes. This phenomenon does not occur during vaccination but may occur during wild flu infection in lung cancer patients. In these patients, the ongoing treatment with ICIs, which is responsible for an increased immune/inflammatory response, could induce the activation of intratumoral APCs via a systemic release of cytokines induced by vaccination and/or by spontaneous viral infection. This could be one of the biologic mechanisms underlying the clinical observation reported within the INVIDIa study [12,13].Focus on the immunological contextThe tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of innate and adaptive immune cells. Although a predominant role was reported for adaptive immune cells, with Th1 cells promoting a pro-inflammatory status versus Th2 cells orchestrating an immunosuppressive phenotype, the innate immune response contributes to the anticancer immunity. Natural killer (NK) cells are circulatory, innate lymphoid cells recognized for their cytotoxic effector functions. Generally, there are two subsets of NKs: CD56hiCD16, which secrete inflammatory cytokines and CD56loCD16hi, which are specialized in cytotoxic functions, along with cell-mediated killing [24]. Within the cancer framework, these cells are extremely efficient in eliminating malignant cells and limiting tumor metastases [24,25]. Tumors employ many mechanisms to evade destruction by NKs, engaging inhibitory NK receptors and utilizing platelets as a shield to avoid NK detection [25]. Many cytokines commonly present in the TME diminish NK effector functions through reduced cytotoxicity, arresting the proliferation and expansion of T cells, enhancing their immune-suppressive properties. Another crucial T-cell type that infiltrates the TME is the Treg, which is responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and impairing antitumor immune responses. The function of Tregs includes direct killing of effector T cells, production of immunosuppressive cytokines and downregulation of co-stimulation by APCs [26]. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are well characterized immune co-inhibitory receptors that have been successfully targeted to promote and enhance immune responses against cancer. CTLA-4 and PD-1 are both induced on T cells upon T-cell receptor signaling activation. On a hand, CTLA-4 is upregulated during the initial stage of T-cell activation, competing with CD28 for the ligands CD86 and CD80 expressed on APCs, thus limiting excessive T-cell priming. On the other hand, PD-1, which is induced later, controls previously activated T cells at the effector sites of immune responses, thus its expression is the marker of T-cell exhaustion. CTLA-4 and PD-1 checkpoints are deregulated in tumor-bearing hosts, characterized by chronic predominating ineffective immune responses, resulting in Treg induction and T-cell exhaustion [27].In this complex context, vaccine stimulation may create new scenarios through interfering in the immune-mediated innate and adaptive responses. The results reported in the INVIDIa study seem to emphasize the role of added, extrinsic immune stimulation in modulating the efficacy of inhibitory molecules targeting immune checkpoints [12,13]. In cancer patients, the immune status is often modified with prevalence of immunosuppression, thus the direct/indirect viral induced response might impact on the immune patient status, resulting in an antiviral response of which anticancer responses will also benefit from. The recent case of a patient with concomitant primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and melanoma progressing on anti-PD-1 therapy, who developed Kaposi’s varicelliform eruption after receiving the first dose of herpes virus-based oncolytic viral therapy, appears to flow in the same direction [28]. The fact that Tregs impair function and boost innate populations such as NK may explain part of this process. Preliminary evidence shows that in renal cancer patients, a high basal percent of functional NK and increased resistance of effector T cells to Treg suppression predicted a better clinical response to treatment with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab [29]. In melanoma, Tregs from anti-PD-1 responding patients showed a reduction in Treg suppressive capacity [30]. In patients treated with the anti-CTLA4 blocking antibody ipilimumab, higher baseline levels of circulating Tregs are associated with improved survival [31]. PD-1 blockade increased the resistance of effector T cells to Treg suppression and directly reduced the suppressive function of Tregs in vitro [31,32]. Challenges with flu-vaccine or flu wild viruses could test this status. In addition, the immunological and clinical response to flu infection and/or vaccine could be investigated as a possible biomarker of ICI response, as it is being explored within the prospective INVIDIa-2 and INVIDIa-BIOS studies currently ongoing [33,34].ConclusionCancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade represents a new population still to be investigated from the immunological viewpoint. The complex modifications occurring in the immune responses of these individuals against noncancer antigens are largely unknown and they potentially influence the oncological outcome. The intentional introduction of vaccinal antigens could contribute, as a further exogenous immunological stimulus, to shift the balance between tolerance and activation, likely influencing both the tumor context and the complex relationships between the tumor and the host. Moreover, the effect of exogenous wild stimuli such as viral or bacterial infections may likely contribute to the immunological ensemble, even potentially interfering with the immune escape from antitumor response. In conclusion, the cancer patient treated with ICI can no longer be considered like the entire cancer population undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy, since the target of ICI is no longer represented by the tumor, but instead by the immune system [35]. Considering this crucial paradigm, the assumptions adopted up today with regard to concomitant medications, vaccinations, true risks from viral or bacterial infections, should be completely discarded and rewritten for this special cancer patient population.AcknowledgmentsWe gratefully acknowledge all the colleagues from 21 Italian centers who contributed to the first INVIDIa study and we are even more grateful to all the colleagues from over 80 Italian centers who are currently contributing to the INVIDIa-2 and INVIDIa-BIOS studies.

As of the 11th of March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (previously known as 2019-nCOV).1, 2 By the 19th of April, 2 241 778 confirmed patients were reported worldwide with 152 552 COVID-19-related deaths.3 The COVID-19 pandemic represents the most serious health crisis facing the modern world resulting in unprecedented efforts to contain this pandemic and its consequences.1 All the coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the ‘Coronaviridae’ family, which, consists of a group of enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded RNA viruses with an extended field of original roots. The CoVs are genotypically and serologically classified into four genera: α, β, γ and δ-CoVs, of which, the α and β CoVs are capable of infecting humans.4 SARS-CoV-2 was recognized as a member of β-CoVs with a genome sequence similar to the bat CoV and SARS-CoV-1.5, 6 SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by the presence of specific spike glycoprotein that shows strong binding affinity to the angiotensinogen-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors; however, it is worth mentioning that SARS-CoV-2 has 10-20 folds higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptors compared with SARS-CoV-1.6, 7 Generally, ACE2 may be expressed in different parts of the human body including the lung, small intestine, colon, duodenum, kidney, testis, gallbladder, heart, oesophagus and urinary bladder, rendering these organs a potential target for the SARS-CoV-2.6, 8 Interestingly, an old report by Hamming et al.9 demonstrated the presence of ACE2 in the basal cell layer of the epidermis continuing to the basal cell layer of the hair follicles, the smooth muscle cells that enclose the sebaceous glands and the eccrine glands. In the same setting, Goren et al.10 postulated a hypothesis that androgen receptors may play a role in the severity of the COVID-19 patients. This hypothesis was based on the disproportionate prevalence of severe COVID-19 among children and adult females compared with adult males. Besides, the ACE2 activity has shown to decrease with the reduction of the androgen hormones.10 However, this theory is not yet proven. The SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious disease that is characterized by a basic reproductive value (R0) of 2–3.5, reflecting the capability of one patient to transmit the disease to 2–3 other persons.11 According to the WHO, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets of infected person in either a direct (close contact with infected person) or indirect (fomites surrounding the infected persons or tools used during examination such as dermatoscope).12, 13 Finally, hidden transmission from asymptomatic carriers was reported.14 There is a broad spectrum of manifestations in COVID-19 patients (fever, dry cough, dyspnoea and myalgia with headache, nausea and diarrhoea being less frequent manifestations).1 The presentations are categorized into four categories: asymptomatic patients (1%); mild to moderate (81%); severe (14%); and critically ill patients (5%). The overall mortality rate is 2.3%.15 Several viral infections are characterized by the presence of related cutaneous manifestations.16 A recent Italian study of 88 COVID-19 patients showed that 20.4% of the patients demonstrated cutaneous manifestation in the form of erythematous rash, urticaria and chickenpox-like vesicles mainly in the trunk with little or no itching. Furthermore, the authors reported that those skin lesions were not correlated with disease severity.17 Similarly, Henry et al.18 reported that COVID-19 patients may present with urticarial eruption without any respiratory symptoms (cough or fever). On the same hand, a COVID-19 patient was misdiagnosed as dengue in Thailand as the principal presentations were skin rash with petechiae and low platelet count.19 Generally, Galván Casas et al.20 performed the first prospective study to classify the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 into five major clincal patterns including pseudo-chilblain (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapules (47%), and livedo or necrosis (6%). In these settings, dermatologists should pay particular consideration to patients presenting with viral-like skin rash so as not to miss COVID-19 cases.21 Generally, skin is considered a part of the immune system as it acts as a shield against different environmental stimuli.22 In this setting, compromising the integrity of this barrier by lacerations, scratching, needling, pre-existing infections or diseases of skin, wounds and burns may facilitate the invasion by micro-organisms.23 Therefore, dermatological patients may be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 either due the loss of the skin integrity by dermatological diseases or the immunosuppressive therapy used in the management of some diseases.24, 25 Many patients may take advantage of the quarantine period to do some cosmetic procedures considering that the quarantine period is an appropriate opportunity for healing and downtime of the skin; however, it should be noted that fractionated ablative laser resurfacing may result in narrow columns of dermal injuries allowing for potential infection.26 Additionally, Micro-needling especially home ones may carry high risk of infection and viral autoinoculation.27 Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, many measures and protocols have been taken to reduce the risk of spread of infection, to flatten the peak of the epidemic curve and to prepare the different healthcare facilities to the expected surge of COVID-19 patients.28, 29 Based on the Chinese experience, only urgent dermatological surgeries should be performed, the capacity of the outpatient clinics should be reduced, all patients should be screened at the clinic entrance for fever or history of travel to endemic areas, and all patients should be wearing masks; however, it is worth mentioning that sometimes the use of masks for patients may be difficult as most of the high-risk carcinomas are located in face region. Furthermore, doctors should wear mask, goggles, protective suits, head caps and gloves.30-32 Generally, the majority of the dermatological outpatient visits are elective, thus, it is recommended to cancel all non-urgent visits and only urgent outpatient visits (including surgeries for malignancies) should be performed provided that adequate protective measures are followed.24, 28, 33, 34 Furthermore, the authors recommended that practitioners at risk of COVID-19 (60 years or older, immunocompromised, pregnant and comorbidities) should avoid contact with patients.33 On the same hand, hospital admission should only be preserved for patients with severe skin disease not responding to outpatient treatment.28 In conclusion, COVID-19 has dramatically affected the dermatological practice; however, dermatologists should pay careful attention not to compromise (by cancelling or deferring) urgent and high-risk cases. One of the medical technologies that gained interest during the current pandemic is the telemedicine that allows the dermatologists to diagnose the patients remotely and prescribe proper treatment without compromising the social distancing role.35-39 There are two types of consultation in teledermatology either synchronous (which include real-time interaction between the patient and the physician) or asynchronous (in which the patients data are stored and then reviewed later by the physician).37. Interestingly, smart phone technology (especially whatsapp) has been proposed to overcome the lack of teledermatology equipment in most of healthcare facilities; however, it may limited by the poor video and images quality, and medicolegal and privacy issues.39 Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic has a great impact on teaching and scientific activities; however, remote teaching of medical students and residents through online lectures, seminars and case discussion is safer compared with the classic methods during this critical time.40 Immunosuppressants are mainly used in the dermatological practice for the management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris and pyoderma gangrenosum.41, 42 However, their use during the current pandemic is a matter of debate as a result of lack of evidence about COVID-19 risk in immunosuppressed patients.43, 44 Conforti et al.,43 suggested that these immunosuppressant drugs may be associated with higher risk of opportunistic infections as they weaken the immune response. This suggestion was based on previous reports about the increased risk of swine influenza A (H1N1) infection or death in psoriatic patients using immunosuppressant drugs.45, 46 Therefore, Conforti et al.,43 proposed that the use of biologics should be weighted in endemic areas with the aim to limit and/or reduce the administration time of these drugs and to stop all immunosuppressants in patients suspected for having COVID-19. Similarly, a consensus of experts’ opinion from New Zealand and Australia advised the cessation of all immunosuppressants (except systemic corticosteroids that should not be suddenly stopped or reduced) in COVID-19-confirmed patients for at least 4 weeks, while for patients with influenza-like symptoms, the dose of immunomodulators should be reduced or stopped for a period of 2 weeks. On the contrary, Bashyam et al.47 reported that some biologics may even play a protective role and enhance the aberrant immune response to COVID-19. This hypothesis was supported by Bardazzi et al.,48 who reported their experience with the use of biologics for psoriatic patients in Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors demonstrated that only 24/176 psoriatic patients developed influenza-like symptoms, of which, only two patients (from the highly infected regions in Italy) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while, the remaining 22 patients did not require testing for COVID-19. However, it is worth mentioning that those two patients were instructed to temporarily stop biologic therapy.48 Interestingly, Mihai et al.49 reported COVID-19 in a 57-years-old woman with systemic sclerosis. The patient was on tocilizumab (Interleukin-6 blocker) for the management of her systemic sclerosis and had a higher risk of severe course of COVID-19 due to the associated comorbidities (insulin-dependent type-2 diabetes and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease); however, the patient showed just mild symptoms for 10 days and the tocilizumab was resumed 4 days after the negative SARS-CoV-2 test.49 Several other authors reported that a case-by-case evaluation may be more convenient as some of these biologics may not be harmful during the COVID-19 pandemic but even theoretically beneficial and their cessation may be associated with the development of anti-drug antibody.50-52 Generally, the recommendation for the immunomodulators use should be based on the mechanism of action of each of drug and its associated risk of infection.53, 54 For example, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors are associated with similar risk of infection by seasonal and H1N1 influenza as compared to normal population55; however, it was associated with up to 7% increased rate of overall infection compared with placebo (except for etanercept).53 Theoretically, TNF-α inhibitors may play a protective role through modulation of inflammation and decreasing alveolar damage as the pneumonia caused by COVID-19 is usually associated with cytokine storm with increased levels of TNF-α and other cytokines.56, 57 Furthermore, adalimumab (TNF-α inhibitor) is currently under trial in China for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.58 Considering interleukin-17 blockers (IL-17), it was associated with 11% increased risk of overall infection; however, major part of this infection was monilial infections. They are characterized by a paradoxical role in viral infections depending on the nature of the virus, where it may either enhance the host’s aberrant immune response or it may aggravate the disease.47 Theoretically, COVID-19 patients may benefit from IL-17 blockers especially patients with higher plasma levels of interleukin-17.59 On the other hand, corticosteroids should be used with great caution as it was associated with delayed viral clearance in SARS and MERS patients but not with increased mortality.56 Therefore, routine use of systemic steroids in the management of COVID-19 patients is not recommended by the WHO.60 The American Academy of Dermatology recommends that patients on biologic therapy without suspicious or confirmed COVID-19 and patients considering the initiation of their biologic therapy should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and a shared decision (between the physician and the patient) should be considered based on the risk versus the benefit of such therapy, while patients who test positive for COVID-19 should consider postponing or cessation of their biologic therapy.44 Similarly, the European Task force on Atopic Dermatitis stated that immunomodulators (including immunosuppressants) should be continued in patients with atopic dermatitis; however, patients should take care of hygienic procedures such as hand washing. Considering atopic dermatitis patients with positive tests for COVID-19, careful risk assessment should be performed before cessation of immunomodulators as the abrupt stoppage of these drugs may be associated with exacerbations of the condition and comorbidities (including asthma, kidney disease and allergy), and topical therapy should be considered during the pause period.61 Cancer patients may be at a higher risk for the development of infectious disease with a 3.5 folds increased risk of developing COVID-19 adverse events including the need for mechanical ventilation and/or death due to their immunocompromised state that is associated to the nature and the aggressiveness of the neoplasm and the anti-cancer treatment.1 Only one report in the literature discussed the adherence of patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma to hedgehog inhibitors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The report included 37 patients, of which, only three patients interrupted the treatment as a result of severe comorbidities, while all the remaining patients either attended the outpatient clinic for the monthly prescription or used a modified treatment scheme to prolong their treatment. It is noteworthy to mention that there is no evidence against the continuation of these drugs during the current pandemic.62 On the other hand, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are considered one of the promising treatment options for patients with advanced melanoma.63 Noteworthy, the susceptibility of patients taking ICIs to infectious diseases has not been thoroughly discussed in the literature. The use of ICIs during the current pandemic may represent a matter of concern as a result of the potential overlap between the SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia and the pulmonary toxicity of the ICIs (however, it should be mentioned that this pneumological toxicity is a rare event ranging from 2.5% to 5% in case of ICIs monotherapy to 7–10% in case of combination therapy). Furthermore, the synergism between the ICIs mechanism of action and the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis may potentiate the pathological effect of COVID-19. In this setting, the use of ICIs should be carefully weighted according to a case-by-case scenario.64 Considering squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, the same precautions (discussed before) should be followed if immunomodulators are considered for treatment. Arora et al.65 raised the concern that patients with rheumatologic skin disease may be at higher risk for COVID-19 either due to the disease itself or its medications. Furthermore, some rheumatological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may be associated with new-onset or reactivation of arthritis during the remission following some viral infections (including coronavirus).65 Considering sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the quarantine and social distancing measures may not only affect physical and psychosocial health of the individuals but also the sexual health, where, these measures may lower the opportunity for casual sex that in turn might reduce the incidence of STDs such as syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the future.66 Furthermore, it is also recommended not to cancel the visits of STD patients (it can be performed using teledermatology or virtual clinics) to avoid the consequences including the further spread of the disease. Several skin complications may result from the prolonged use of personal protective equipment as a result of hyperhydration effect, friction and allergic contact reactions.25 The prevalence of skin damage resulting from wearing protective equipment was 97.0% among healthcare workers including lesions of the nasal bridge (83.1%), hands, cheek and forehead.67 Furthermore, excessive hand washing with detergents and/or disinfectants may cause contact dermatitis.25 In these settings, a consensus of Chinese experts on the protection of the skin and mucous membranes was released recommending that hand washing or gloves decontamination should be limited to the following moments: before touching the patients or any aseptic procedure and after exposure to body fluids, touching the patient or any of the patients’ items. Furthermore, they recommended the use of ethanol for hand hygiene and applying hand cream following each time of hand hygiene if possible. However, in case of latex gloves it is recommended to wear a cotton gloves below and to use moisturizers with topical glucocorticoid cream. Similarly, it is recommended to use a properly fitting mask and goggles and apply moisturizers or gel at contact areas.68 Furthermore, Yin et al.69 suggested the use of double protection (benzalkonium chloride paste on the nasal bridge followed by hydrocolloid dressing) before wearing the N95 masks. Many vaccines had been injected intralesionally to treat warts, as BCG, which, results in IL-12 increase and IL-4 decrease and MMR vaccine, which, is capable of stimulating the cell-mediated and humoral immune response.70 Children are characterized by significantly lower risks for developing severe form of COVID-19 with lower mortality rates compared to adult population and this may be due to the global active viral immunization of children.71, 72 Based on these observations, the vaccines that have been used to treat viral skin lesions can theoretically be a potential treatment option of COVID-19; however, further studies are required to confirm the role of vaccines in COVID 19 prophylaxis and/or treatment. There is a strong rationale for the use of antimalarial drugs [chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine] to treat infections. These drugs are considered to be immunomodulators as they reduce T-cell activation, suppress the toll-like receptors (TLR) signalling and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production by T cells and B cells.73 In animal studies, CQ was capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV spread either prior to or after infection, suggesting that CQ might have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages.74 In this setting, Chinese experts recommend that patients with COVID-19 (mild, moderate or severe) and without contraindications to chloroquine should be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice daily for 10 days.75 However, these drugs should be used with caution and under medical supervision to avoid macular retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders that may be life-threatening.76 Ivermectin is an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug that is characterized by anti-viral activity. An ex vivo study demonstrated that ivermectin is able to produce approximately 5000 folds reduction in the viral RNA in the treated cells compared with the control samples. These promising results should promote in vivo studies.77 These recommendations are based on the findings of the current review, the protocols in the dermatology department in our universities, and the measures recommended by CDC (centre for disease control and prevention). Table 1 shows a summary of recommendations based on the findings of the current review.},

The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) was formed to collect granular data on patients with cancer and COVID-19 at scale and as rapidly as possible. CCC19 has grown from five initial institutions to 125 institutions with >400 collaborators. More than 5,000 cases with complete baseline data have been accrued.

When the COVID-19 pandemic began, formal frameworks to collect data about affected patients were lacking. The COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) was formed to collect granular data on patients with cancer and COVID-19 at scale and as rapidly as possible.

Future directions include increased electronic health record integration for direct data ingestion, expansion to additional domestic and international sites, more intentional patient involvement, and granular analyses of still-unanswered questions related to cancer subtypes and treatments. Patients with cancer have a higher risk of infection and subsequent morbidity and mortality because of their generally compromised immune systems. This is also the case for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. Patients with cancer are twice as likely to die from this infection compared to the general population (Bakouny et al., 2020Bakouny Z. Hawley J.E. Choueiri T.K. Peters S. Rini B.I. Warner J.L. Painter C.A.

The pandemic has also led to significant disruption in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer, which is anticipated to lead to an indirect increase in morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population (Bakouny et al., 2020Bakouny Z. Hawley J.E. Choueiri T.K. Peters S. Rini B.I. Warner J.L. Painter C.A.

Oncology practice during the COVID-19 pandemic.JAMA. 2020; 323: 2005-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, studying SARS-CoV-2 and its resultant COVID-19 in patients with cancer is highly warranted. The complex nature of infectious disease research studies in patients with cancer is exacerbated during pandemics, when healthcare personnel are severely challenged by time and energy to collect and enter data in electronic survey instruments. The population of patients with cancer is extremely heterogenous, with differences in types of cancer; numerous treatment regimens; differences in survivorship/time from diagnosis of cancer; and differences in baseline characteristics such as age, gender, race, comorbidities, and other sociodemographic factors. Electronic health records (EHRs) are also not specifically designed for answering cancer- or infection-related questions. They generally lack specific structured fields on infection-specific information (e.g., prior use of antimicrobial treatment or any ongoing secondary prophylaxis, exposure history of infection, onset of symptoms, etc.) and cancer-specific information (e.g., Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status, cancer status, treatment intent, treatment context, etc.). Furthermore, ascertainment of causality is often extremely difficult, and attribution of death to infection or cancer is almost impossible without an autopsy. Serious consideration for epidemiological and statistical challenges such as multicollinearity, measured and unmeasured confounding, interaction between various risk factors, bidirectional effect between infection and cancer, and multiple competing risks for outcomes is essential to prevent false positive and false negative claims and avoid wastage of precious resources during a pandemic. Despite these challenges, carefully designed cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies can rapidly answer many questions that prospectively designed clinical trials cannot within a practicable and feasible time frame. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, information on the risks posed to patients with cancer was extremely scant (Liang et al., 2020Liang W. Guan W. Chen R. Wang W. Li J. Xu K. Li C. Ai Q. Lu W. Liang H. et al.Cancer patients in SARS-CoV-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in China.Lancet Oncol. 2020; 21: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2977) Google Scholar). At the same time, the relatively new technologies of social media platforms and EHRs offered the opportunity to quickly undertake a multi-institutional and international effort to better understand the prognosis of infected patients, with an immediate goal of improving patient care. Prompted by the need for rapid assessment of clinical impact of COVID-19 in patients with cancer, and to identify and share the best practices to facilitate care during this pandemic, an active conversation took place on Twitter and other social media platforms, using the hashtag #COVID19nCancer. A dynamic discussion ensued, and the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) was convened on March 15, 2020, by five founding institutions (Desai et al., 2020Desai A. Warner J. Kuderer N. Thompson M. Painter C. Lyman G. Lopes G. Crowdsourcing a crisis response for COVID-19 in oncology.Nat. Cancer. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-020-0065-zCrossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; Rubinstein et al., 2020Rubinstein S.M. Steinharter J.A. Warner J. Rini B.I. Peters S. Choueiri T.K. The COVID-19 and cancer consortium: a collaborative effort to understand the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer.Cancer Cell. 2020; 37: 738-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The driving goal and mission statement of CCC19 is “to collect and disseminate prospective, granular, uniformly organized information on people with cancer who are diagnosed with COVID-19—at scale and as rapidly as possible.” The consortium is governed by a steering committee comprised of members with a diverse clinical and research background in oncology, hematology, viral epidemiology, clinical informatics, and biostatistics. In addition to the steering committee, operational subcommittees include publications (to establish authorship guidelines for projects utilizing CCC19 data and/or resources), funding (to identify sources of funding for the consortium, disseminate this information to consortium members, and assist in the writing and critical revision of grants), epidemiology and biostatistics (to establish guidelines and provide support to investigators in designing and executing studies with the highest rigor, reproducibility, and impact), informatics (to develop and maintain the survey instrument[s] and oversee standardization of the data model, integration of data directly from EHRs, and visualization of data), and patient advocacy (to engage with cancer patient communities and advocacy networks and to coordinate with parties reaching out to CCC19). The CCC19 survey was developed to create a de-identified centralized registry housed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), with participation limited to health care professionals or their proxies. No protected health information (PHI), as defined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), is collected by this centralized registry, which is IRB exempt (VUMC #200467). Participants voluntarily report details about patients with cancer under their direct care or at their institution who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. The survey respondents are anonymous and are not compensated by the consortium. Initially, the survey was open to any anonymous reporter in authorized countries; however, given data quality concerns and an inability to obtain follow-up from fully anonymous participants, eligibility was subsequently restricted to participating sites. Notably, while the site PI is identified to the consortium, the actual survey respondents remain anonymous. The participating sites may or may not implement their own separate IRB approval. Any site participating in CCC19 must execute a data transfer agreement following the standardized Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) template (https://thefdp.org/default/committees/research-compliance/data-stewardship/). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04354701, and is ongoing. A centralized website (https://ccc19.org/) has been created to direct potential participants to the survey, collect feedback, and disseminate results. Eligibility criteria have been kept simple and non-restrictive to ensure capturing a wide range of patients with cancer and COVID-19. Inclusion criteria for entering a case include suspected (presumptive positive based on clinical presentation) COVID-19 or laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and a current or past medical history of invasive malignancy (any type). No restriction is placed on how long ago a cancer diagnosis might have occurred, since patients may have received potentially lung-toxic therapy even many decades prior (e.g., bleomycin for Hodgkin lymphoma or testicular cancer). Exclusion criteria include participants located within countries not explicitly approved for participation by the VUMC legal counsel or reports from non-healthcare providers (or their proxies). Prior entry into another COVID-19 registry is allowed, although all respondents are asked to report on such reporting, when it does occur, to address concerns of duplicated data (Bauchner et al., 2020Bauchner H. Golub R.M. Zylke J. Editorial concern—possible reporting of the same patients with COVID-19 in different reports.JAMA. 2020; 323: 1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A centralized database was developed using the REDCap web browser-based platform (Harris et al., 2009Harris P.A. Taylor R. Thielke R. Payne J. Gonzalez N. Conde J.G. Research electronic data capture (REDCap)--a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.J. Biomed. Inform. 2009; 42: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (24761) Google Scholar). REDCap also permits prospective and longitudinal data collection to enhance data capture of new variables or long-term outcomes as we gather more knowledge about COVID-19, and accommodates structured and free-text data entry. Given recent advances in natural language processing techniques, we provide free text entry for concepts difficult to capture with structured questionnaires (e.g., cancer-specific treatment, unanticipated COVID-19-related complications) (Savova et al., 2019Savova G.K. Danciu I. Alamudun F. Miller T. Lin C. Bitterman D.S. Tourassi G. Warner J.L. Use of natural language processing to extract clinical cancer phenotypes from electronic medical records.Cancer Res. 2019; 79: 5463-5470Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whenever feasible, structured variables were mapped to existing terminologies to support future data harmonization efforts, e.g., SNOMED-CT for comorbidities and ATC for medication exposures. The HemOnc ontology was used to describe cancer-specific concepts such as context of systemic anti-cancer therapy (Warner et al., 2019Warner J.L. Dymshyts D. Reich C.G. Gurley M.J. Hochheiser H. Moldwin Z.H. Belenkaya R. Williams A.E. Yang P.C. HemOnc: A new standard vocabulary for chemotherapy regimen representation in the OMOP common data model.J. Biomed. Inform. 2019; 96: 103239https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We deliberately chose vocabularies identified as being standard terminologies by the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium (Hripcsak et al., 2015Hripcsak G. Duke J.D. Shah N.H. Reich C.G. Huser V. Schuemie M.J. Suchard M.A. Park R.W. Wong I.C.K. Rijnbeek P.R. et al.Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI): opportunities for observational researchers.Stud. Health Technol. Inform. 2015; 216: 574-578PubMed Google Scholar). All variables contain an “Unknown” option. Given the flexibility and extensibility of REDCap, some sites prefer to build and maintain local instances for direct data entry instead of reporting into the central VUMC instance. This also allows for the addition of site-specific variables for local needs. We designed customized forms for cancer and COVID-19 as per the limited literature on COVID-19 risk factors and outcomes available at the time of starting the registry and have continuously included emerging variables of clinical significance for more focused and precise analyses (Figure 1A). Most questions in the survey are optional, with a subset being mandatory; evolution of the knowledge of prognostic factors has led to conversion of some variables from optional to mandatory (e.g., cancer status, which is strongly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality) (Kuderer et al., 2020aKuderer N.M. Choueiri T.K. Shah D.P. Shyr Y. Rubinstein S.M. Rivera D.R. Shete S. Hsu C.-Y. Desai A. de Lima Lopes Jr., G. et al.COVID-19 and Cancer ConsortiumClinical impact of COVID-19 on patients with cancer (CCC19): a cohort study.Lancet. 2020; 395: 1907-1918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). The survey is designed such that incompletely filled-out forms can be completed at a later time, using a unique link that is generated within the REDCap system and available only to the respondent. Data entry personnel can voluntarily return and add outcome data and/or complete the forms using this unique link provided to them as the patient’s clinical course evolves. The survey includes the following five data collection forms: (1) Patient Demographics, (2) COVID-19 Details, (3) Cancer Details, (4) Respondent Details, and (5) Follow-up. Further details about the content of the forms can be found at https://ccc19.org/faqs. Due to the challenges of temporality as well as the need to define composite outcomes and risk factors, a large number of derived variables have been developed. These have evolved in parallel with the main survey instruments. Given that many of the variables are optional and that there is an “Unknown” option for each variable, missingness and excessive unknown responses are concerns for both raw and derived variables. In order to mitigate these concerns, we developed a quality score that is used to evaluate case reports for targeted improvement. Data problems are classified as minor (1 point), moderate (3 points), and major (5 points) (Table 1). Quality score metrics are periodically returned to sites, and the overall change in the cumulative distribution of quality scores is shared with the consortium on a regular basis.Table 1Quality Score MetricsMajor Problems (5 Points)Moderate Problems (3 Points)Minor Problems (1 Point)High levels of baseline missingnessCancer status missingCancer status unknownLarge number of unknownsECOG performance status missingECOG performance status unknown30-day f/u is 60+ days overdue30-day f/u is 30–59 days overdueDeath status missing or unknownMetastatic status missing or unknownBaseline COVID-19 severity missing or unknownICU status missing or unknownHospitalization status missing or unknownIntubation status missing or unknownO2 need missing or unknownDays to death missing or unknownADT missing or unknown (prostate cancer only)Biomarkers missing or unknown (breast cancer only)BCG exposure missing or unknown (bladder cancer only)ADT, androgen deprivation therapy; BCG, Bacillus Calmette-Guérin; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.

In order to increase and maintain the transparency of the CCC19 project, the data dictionary is made freely available through a public GitHub repository: https://github.com/covidncancer/CCC19_dictionary. The code to create all derived variables is also maintained here. A static version of the data dictionary and a list of derived variables can be downloaded through the CCC19 website at https://ccc19.org/faqs. New variable requests are collected through a crowdsourced process at https://redcap.link/CCC19-variable-request. Participating sites have a right to obtain their own data on demand. A fully de-identified aggregated extract of the CCC19 registry is made freely available to non-commercial and academic researchers after an embargo period of approximately 6 months from prespecified data submission deadlines, during which members of the consortium have the opportunity to conduct scientific inquiries and publish the results. Since its founding, the consortium has expanded to 120+ institutions and 400+ individual members (Figure 1B). As of October 14, 2020, there are 5,991 records in the central database, of which 4,959 (83%) have complete baseline data. Among participating sites, 81 have reported one or more cases, 68 have reported 10+ cases, and 17 have reported 100+ cases. Three analyses have been published to date: (1) an analysis of risk factors associated with 30-day all-cause mortality in N = 928 patients (Kuderer et al., 2020aKuderer N.M. Choueiri T.K. Shah D.P.

Initial beta testing indicated that the baseline information in the survey would take ∼5–15 min to complete. The practical experience after the first ∼4,000 cases have been entered indicates that the process follows a Poisson distribution after removal of outliers, with median of 25 min (10th percentile, 9 min; 90th percentile, 71 min) per case (Figure 2A). An analysis of data quality at the time of the fourth data lock (July 31, 2020) indicated that the overall quality of reports was acceptable but in need of improvement, with 78% of cases meeting the predetermined threshold (Figure 2B). After targeted queries to sites, the cumulative quality score improved significantly, with 88% of cases meeting the predetermined threshold. In a very short period of time, CCC19 formed to become one of the largest consortia focused on COVID-19 and its effects on patients with cancer. In addition to publications to date, a number of specific subprojects are underway to make the most of this large data resource. The web-based survey asks for information that is collected during routine clinical care. There is an indirect risk to the patient that the respondent could inadvertently disclose PHI in a free text response field; all structured fields (such as age) are constructed such that PHI cannot be disclosed. Clear instructions are given within the survey that no PHI is to be recorded, and the survey respondent is also advised to speak with their Privacy Office if they have any concerns about sharing non-PHI clinical data. Breach of confidentiality poses a risk to institutions and to individuals. The benefits of critical information for understanding the burden of novel infection and methods to prevent and treat complications still outweigh the risks of data collection in such registries; thus local IRB offices are encouraged to approve the study with waiver of HIPAA Authorization. A separate risk to scientific integrity is that of excessive missing or unknown data. In our early analyses, expediency was key, and a high level of missingness was deemed acceptable; standard statistical methods of multiple imputation were used to partially address this issue. Unknown responses are more problematic, although they may occasionally be medically appropriate, such as cancer status being unknown in the period between initiation of a treatment and the first assessment by imaging or physical exam. For example, in our initial analysis, we found that having an unknown number of comorbidities was associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality, pAOR 6.77 (95% CI, 1.42–32.33) (Kuderer et al., 2020aKuderer N.M. Choueiri T.K. Shah D.P. Shyr Y. Rubinstein S.M. Rivera D.R. Shete S. Hsu C.-Y.

With the introduction of the quality score described above, records not meeting a sufficient quality score (less than 5 points, i.e., no major problems and at most one moderate problem) will only be used for descriptive purposes in future CCC19 data reports; others are considered for full analyses, subject to standard additional project-specific exclusion criteria. This generally follows the model of “analytic cases” as used by the cancer registry community (Mallin et al., 2013Mallin K. Palis B.E. Watroba N. Stewart A.K. Walczak D. Singer J. Barron J.

It is imperative to conduct periodic critical evaluations to ensure established and ongoing objectives are being met. We will adapt over time to encompass emerging information on COVID-19 (e.g., antibody levels, SARS-CoV-2 genomic tests, etc.), as well as possibly additional patient data (e.g., patient-reported outcomes) to augment the existing clinical data. As a grassroots and member-driven organization, the scientific direction of CCC19 will be influenced by member interests and expertise. Given the wide range of EHR platforms across participating institutions and the regulatory restrictions, we were unable to utilize the integration of EHR for direct data capture; however, this research capacity is essential to quickly capture and disseminate findings via informatics platforms during novel pandemics in future. EHR integration will also allow better data harmonization efforts with other groups building complementary registries. Finally, this is a completely voluntary project, so identifying and securing funding is essential to maintain the sustainability of such endeavors.

The WHO recommend neonatal BCG vaccination in countries with high incidence of tuberculosis, with BCG being one of the safest and most widely distributed vaccines worldwide [1]. BCG is well known for its ability to induce a heterologous immunomodulatory effect on nonrelated conditions, a mechanism which is well understood and documented in the infectious disease literature. Most successfully, BCG is the most effective immunotherapy in oncology to date; it is used for treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, being standard of care to achieve reduction in tumor progression and recurrence [2]. Global shortages of BCG in 2016 and again in 2019, driven by both increased demand and manufacturing constraints, have significantly impacted supply chains and resulted in change in practice in management of bladder cancer, with dose reduction and limitations in many countries. This treatment has been affected in recent years by global shortages of the agent. The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted urgent need for novel vaccination or means of reducing disease morbidity and mortality in the global community. Promising new trials aim to ascertain whether this commonly used vaccine has a role in the fight against COVID-19.Since introduction of the BCG vaccine in 1921, an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated its ability to exert a range of nonspecific immunological effects beneficial for a range of other conditions. In epidemiological studies, neonatal BCG vaccination is associated with reduction in all-cause child mortality by 30% (0.70; CI 95%: 0.49–1.01), widely thought to be related to reduction in rates of neonatal sepsis and pneumonia [3]. BCG has the ability to train the innate immune system to generate an immune memory against secondary infections, a process also termed trained immunity [4]. This immune response has been shown to last up to 1 year following vaccination [5]. In mouse models, BCG was found to induce a trained immune response to avian influenza A (H7N9), however it was not associated with a clinical difference in survival, clinical scores or pulmonary inflammation [6]. In vivo studies have looked at effects of BCG vaccination on human monocytes following infection with yellow fever virus. Arts et al. successfully demonstrated epigenetic reprogramming of the innate immune system and reduction in yellow fever viremia [7]. The ability for BCG vaccination to induce a trained immune response to nonrelated pathogens raises the exciting possibility that it may have a role in protecting against the COVID-19 virus.In several preprint manuscripts released online, authors have conducted epidemiological analyses of COVID-19 incidence in relation to nation-based BCG vaccination policies [8]. These studies observed a higher COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality in those countries which do not have a current or recent, universal BCG vaccination policy, suggesting that BCG vaccination may be a protecting factor. However, as with any observational epidemiological study, we caution that data such as these should be interpreted as hypothesis generating only. Given the widespread inconsistencies in collecting data relating to COVID-19 between countries, consideration of the stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in each country, differences in testing rates, isolation policies, national disease burden and demographics all must to taken into consideration. The WHO recently released a scientific brief cautioning against indiscriminate use of BCG in COVID-19 until appropriate evidence from ongoing studies becomes available [9].Encouragingly, three new clinical trials have commenced recruitment aiming to test the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may be protective against COVID-19 in healthcare workers. The clinical trials, based in Australia (‘BRAVE’; PI Curtis), USA (‘BADAS’; PI: Kamat, Dinardo) and The Netherlands (PI: Netea), plan to randomize cumulatively greater than 6000 healthcare workers to BCG vaccination versus a placebo agent. The primary outcome measures in each study differ; the Australian and American groups looking to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 and severity of symptoms from disease and the Dutch group primarily looking at healthcare worker absenteeism [10–12]. A fourth, observational case-control, study based in Egypt has commenced recruitment examining COVID-19 positive patients comparing severity of disease in those who are tested positive for past BCG exposure or immunization to those who are tested negative [13].With regards to patients receiving intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer, the potential effects of this treatment on COVID-19 infection is unclear. Mechanism of action following vaccination and topical intravesical administration differs significantly [14,15]. A pilot study has, however, demonstrated increased cytokine response in ex vivo monocytes of BCG-treated bladder cancer patients suggesting that intravesical administration of BCG may have the ability to induce a state of trained immunity to some degree [16]. Lastly, concerning the global shortage of BCG supply already affecting BCG treatment for patients with bladder cancer, careful consideration of appropriate usage of BCG is necessary. One vial of BCG used for bladder cancer can vaccinate up to 500 healthcare workers. It is encouraging that patient advocacy groups have come out with support for such trials [8]; it is up to us to ensure appropriate stewardship with regards to prevention of excessive depletion of already limited supplies.ConclusionUndoubtedly the heterologous immune effects of BCG provide a promising avenue for investigation in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. As cautioned by the WHO, appropriate evidence must be established prior to more widespread use for BCG for this purpose. Three new clinical trials aim to ascertain the protective role of BCG vaccination against COVID-19 virus, a possibility that would have global beneficial implications amidst the current pandemic.Financial \& competing interests disclosureThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

	abstract = {The BCG vaccine, widely used in Brazil in new-borns, induces adjuvant protection for several diseases, including childhood virus infections. BCG activates monocytes and innate memory NK cells which are crucial for the antiviral immune response. Therefore, strategies to prevent COVID-19 in health workers (HW) should be carried out to prevent them becoming unwell so that they can continue to work during the pandemic. The hypothesis is that BCG will improve the innate immune response and prevent symptomatic infection or COVID-19 severity. The primary objective is to verify the effectiveness and safety of the BCG vaccine to prevent or reduce incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the city of Goiânia (Brazil) among HW previously vaccinated with BCG and also its severity and mortality during the pandemic of the disease. Secondary objectives are to estimate the incidence of COVID-19 among these professionals and the innate immune response elicited to BCG.This a phase II trial for repositioning BCG as a preventive strategy against COVID-19. The trial is an open-label, parallel-group randomised clinical trial, comparing HW vaccinated with BCG and HW not vaccinated.The trial will recruit 800 HW of Goiânia - Goiás, Brazil to reach a total of 400 HW included after comorbidities questioning and laboratorial evaluation. Eligibility criteria: Any HW presenting BCG vaccination scar with direct contact with suspected COVID-19 patients for at least 8 hours per week, whether in hospital beds, ICU, or in transportation or admission (nurses, doctors, physiotherapists, nutritionists, receptionists, etc.) who have negative IgM and IgG COVID-19 test. Participants with any of the following characteristics will be excluded: - Have had in the last fifteen days any signs or symptoms of virus infection, including COVID-19; - Have had fever in the last fifteen days; - Have been vaccinated fifteen days before the inclusion; - Have a history or confirmation of any immunosuppressive disease such as HIV, presented solid tumour in the last two years or autoimmune diseases; - Are under preventive medication with antibiotics, steroid anti-inflammatories, or chemotherapy; - Have less than 500 neutrophils per mL of blood; - Have previously been diagnosed with tuberculosis; - Are breastfeeding or pregnant; - Are younger than 18 years old; - Are participating as an investigator in this clinical trial.HW will be randomized into the BCG vaccinated group or the BCG unvaccinated control group. The BCG vaccinated group will receive in the right arm, intradermally, a one off dose of 0.1 mL corresponding to approximately 2 x105 to 8 x105 CFU of live, freeze-dried, attenuated BCG Moscow 361-I, Bacillus Calmette Guerin vaccine (Serum Institute of India PVT. LTD.). The unvaccinated control group will not be vaccinated. The HW allocated in both groups will be followed up at specific times points until 180 days post inclusion. The vaccinated and control groups will be compared according to COVID-19 related outcomes.The primary outcomes are the incidence coefficient of infection by SARS-CoV-2 determined by RT-PCR of naso-oropharyngeal swab specimen or rapid lateral flow IgG and IgM test, and presence of general COVID-19 symptoms, disease severity and admission to hospital during the 180 days of follow up. The secondary outcome is the innate immune response elicited 15-20 days after vaccination.The vaccine vial contains approximately 10 doses. In order to optimize the vaccine use, the randomisation was performed in blocks of 20 participants using the platform randomization.com [ http://www.jerrydallal.com/random/permute.htm ]. The randomization was prepared before any HW inclusion. The results were printed and inserted in sealed envelopes that were numbered with BCG-001 to BCG-400. The printed results as well the envelopes had the same numbers. At the time of the randomisation, each participant that meets the inclusion criteria will receive a consecutive participant number [BCG-001-BCG-400]. The sealed envelope with the assigned number, blinded to the researchers, will be opened in front of the participant and the arm allocation will be known.There is no masking for the participants or for the healthcare providers. The study will be blinded to the laboratory researchers and to those who will be evaluating the outcomes and performing the statistical analyses. In this case, only the participant identification number will be available.Four hundred heath workers will be randomised in two groups. Two hundred participants will be vaccinated, and 200 participants will not be vaccinated.The protocol approved by the Brazilian Ethical Committee is the seventh version, number CAAE: 31783720.0.0000.5078. The trial has been recruiting since September 20th, 2020. The clinical trial protocol was registered on August 5th, 2020. It is estimated that recruitment will finish by March 2021.The protocol number was registered on August 5th, 2020 at REBEC (Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Clínicos). Register number: RBR-4kjqtg and WHO trial registration number UTN: U1111-1256-3892.The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

In light of the high rate of mortality associated with COVID-19, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to prevent the infection are currently being tested. Among non-pharmacological preventive measures, vaccines represent one of the main resources for public health. It has been suggested that Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may protect individuals against infection from COVID-19 virus, and two clinical trials addressing this question are underway.

To date, there is no approved targeted treatment, and many investigational therapeutic agents and vaccine candidates are being considered for the treatment of COVID-19. To extract and summarize information on potential vaccines and therapeutic agents against COVID-19 at different stages of clinical trials from January to March 2020, we reviewed major clinical trial databases such as ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and other primary registries between January and March 15, 2020. Interventional studies at different phases under the COVID-19 pipeline were included. A total of 249 clinical trials were identified between January to March 15, 2020. After filtering observational studies (194 studies), a total of 56 interventional trials were considered. The majority of clinical trials have been conducted on chloroquine (n=10) and traditional Chinese medications (TCMs; n=10), followed by antivirals (n=8), anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressants (n=9), cellular therapies (n=4), combinations of different antivirals therapies (n=3), antibacterial (n=1), and other therapies (n=5). Five vaccines are under phase I, and there are a couple of phase III trials on the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine under investigation among healthcare workers. Many novel compounds and vaccines against COVID-19 are currently under investigation. Some candidates have been tested for other viral infections and are listed for clinical trials against the COVID-19 pipeline. Currently, there are no effective specific antivirals or drug combinations available for the treatment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {>To the Editor, “Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.” – Tao-Te-Ching (Book of the Way) by Lao-Tzu, 350 BCE Since its first report in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel pandemic COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, has rampaged throughout the world.1 People with asthma and allergies are usually at greater risk of more severe outcomes with virus infections. However, recent reports have accumulated evidences that the prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma in patients with COVID-19 is lower than expected among other comorbidities and risk factors of the severe form of COVID-19 (Appendix S1 for additional reference 1-3). Why are then allergic diseases and asthma underrepresented as co-morbid risk factors in patients with COVID-19? Is this a sampling bias in the currently published clinical reports or is there a real discrepancy in the prevalence of asthma among COVID-19-infected patients that may glean a light for us to fight this pandemic? Here, we hypothesize the plausible mechanisms in asthmatics based on available publications (Appendix S1) that may have effects in determining their susceptibility to and disease severity with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Firstly, coronavirus recognition and infection are dependent on the cellular receptors, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for docking spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to cleave the docked spike protein for virus entry by membrane fusion (Appendix S1, Reference 4, 5). The gene expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are influenced by the genetic variants of the host and microbial infections, and induced by innate immune response, such as the production of interferons and mucins.2 In asthma patients, the expression of these two molecules in the respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection is determined by the age, gender, comorbidity, and type 2 allergic inflammation. Jackson et al3 found asthma and respiratory allergy are associated with reduced ACE2 expression in airway cells based on their patient cohorts. In contrast, Sajuthi et al4 demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 allergic inflammation mainly by interleukin-13. Peters et al5 found the gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the cells obtained from induced sputum did not differ between healthy subjects and asthmatics. Therefore, these reports did not reveal convincing information, regarding whether asthmatic patients have lower expression of ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV-2 based on their allergic status and/or chronic lung inflammation. Particularly, these studies lack the effect of SARS-CoV-2-specific analysis and observations in asthmatic patients to be able to reach a conclusion in the real world. Secondly, viral load and immune response of the host determine the final outcome and/or the severity of ARDS and multiple organ failure in COVID-19-infected patients. For asthmatic patients, the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection may be impaired due to lower levels of IFNγ in their bronchial epithelial cells, but it may also be favourable in reducing ACE2 expression, which is depended on IFNγ production.4 In addition to IFNs, there are other molecules of innate immunity in the respiratory tract that may also have anti-viral functions, such as mannose-binding lectin (MBL), and surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) that are produced by alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, which are also largely infected by SARS coronavirus. These molecules, MBL and SP-D, found in higher concentrations in the BALF of patients with asthma and respiratory allergy and are increased due to chronic inflammation, have been identified to bind spike protein of SARS coronavirus, inhibit its binding of the ACE2 cellular receptor and are thereby able to protect the alveolar macrophages from virus-induced activation6, 7 Recently, trained immunity found in the myeloid cells and alveolar macrophages of asthmatics may provide anti-viral immunity in specific organs such as the lungs (Appendix S1, reference 6-8). Although this hypothesis has not been validated in patients with COVID-19, clinical trials to boost trained innate immunity by BCG vaccination to protect against COVID-19 have been initiated in several countries.8 Finally, we highlight that therapeutic medications and biologics used for asthma control may have some beneficial pharmacological effects in COVID-19 infections. From in vitro models, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators have been shown to suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production (Appendix S1, reference 9). Asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) demonstrated lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their bronchial epithelial cells.5 There is a clinical report of the improvement in three COVID-19-infected patients after using inhaled ciclesonide, although this study did not have proper controls (Appendix S1, reference 10). Clinical observation in children with severe asthma who received anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) have shown decreased duration of human rhinovirus infections, viral shedding and risk of virus-related exacerbation (Appendix S1, reference 11). In vitro, omalizumab attenuated plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) FcεRIα protein expression while simultaneously augmenting pDC IFN-α responses to rhinovirus and influenza virus (Appendix S1, reference 12). Together, these findings provide direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases susceptibility to respiratory viral illnesses through enhanced IFN-α responses in pDCs. More interestingly, azithromycin combined with hydroxychloroquine in an open-label nonrandomized clinical trial for COVID-19-infected patients has significantly decreased the viral load after six days of treatment compared with untreated controls (Appendix S1, reference 13). Azithromycin has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbation and improve the quality of life of asthmatic adults and preschool children with asthma that was not adequately controlled on standard inhaler therapy (Appendix S1, reference 14, 15). Although the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory effect in asthma is still not well defined, Gielen and co-workers (Appendix S1, reference 16) demonstrated that azithromycin augments IFN-β and IFN-λ production and decreasing rhinovirus replication and release from rhinovirus-infected human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. Other studies also presented reduction levels of IL-6 and TNF-α after azithromycin treatment (Appendix S1, reference 17, 18). More interestingly, it is suggested that azithromycin may have protective effects in reducing SARS-CoV-2 invasion by interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions, a novel SARS-CoV-2 cellular receptors beside ACE2, and decreasing the expression of some metalloproteinases (downstream to CD147) in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus (Appendix S1, reference 19). However, controlled clinical trials using azithromycin to treat patients with COVID-19 (not involving asthmatic subjects) are now registered in several countries with results still pending. In summary, we have seen a new zoonotic coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, infection that has had a devastating effect on the host immunity via the inhibition of interferons leading to aberrant innate immune response, macrophage inflammation in releasing a cytokine storm and exhaustion of the cellular immunity of T lymphocytes.9 Fortunately, due to chronic and sustained type 2 immune inflammation in the lungs of asthmatic patients, or by the medications they use for asthma control, it seems asthma may not be a major confounding disease in COVID-19 infection, and this unexpected phenomenon may shed a new light on finding therapies or preventative strategies for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). We still need a more comprehensive and in-depth immune analysis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the coming days to explore this hypothesis. However, all standard asthma therapies, whether inhaled steroids, combination of inhaled steroid plus long acting bronchodilator therapies or monoclonal antibodies like omalizumab and azithromycin, should be continued to be used to optimize asthma controls. For they can not only substantially reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation, but also will reduce risks and severe outcomes of COVID-19.

	abstract = {See related Reply To the Editors:We read the Letter from China by Guan and Zhong regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with immense interest, as it provided novel insight into this catastrophic pandemic.1 COVID-19 hotspots until February 2020 were East-Asian cities including Wuhan (China) and Yokohama (Japan) where the cruise ship Diamond Princess harboured. The mortality rate in Asia-Pacific countries increased at a slower rate until mid-April compared to some Euro-American countries.2 Notably, COVID-19 high-burden countries in Western Europe and North America, such as Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Spain, France, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, do not currently recommend universal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination because tuberculosis is not highly prevalent.3 BCG induces trained immunity (innate immune memory) by non-specific cross-protection against non-tuberculous pathogens.4 Therefore, some researchers believe that people vaccinated with BCG have some immune protection to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Nevertheless, other researchers counter that this association can be explained by confounding factors including the abundant medical resources of the COVID-19 high-burden countries. To reduce this confounding effect, we compared population-based mortality from COVID-19 using data of only World Bank-defined high-income countries.2, 5 The high-income countries and regions were classified into two groups based on national policies regarding universal BCG vaccination3: ‘Currently Recommended Countries (CRC)’ and ‘Currently Not Recommended Countries (CNRC)’. CNRC were further divided into ‘Never Recommended Countries’ and ‘Previously Recommended Countries’3 (Fig. 1). We analysed mortality data from 27 CRC and 23 CNRC. All CRC provide the first BCG shot at birth except for Greece (6 years), Malta (school age) and Barbados (5–6 years). Median mortality per one million population for CRC was significantly lower than that for CNRC (2.1 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.7–8.0) vs 42.6 (IQR: 13.1–139.3), Mann–Whitney P < 0.001; Fig. 1). Mortality rates significantly differed between the three groups (Kruskal–Wallis P < 0.001; Fig. 1). The highest median mortality of 146.5 (IQR: 56.6–260.5) was found in the Never Recommended Countries, followed by 34.0 (IQR: 11.0–108.4) in the Previously Recommended Countries and 2.1 (IQR: 0.7–8.0) in the CRC. Guan and Zhong called for active prevention measures to combat the current global pandemic.1 National policies for paediatric universal BCG vaccination possibly contribute to reducing COVID-19-related mortality. We expect that ongoing randomized trials will confirm the role of BCG vaccination in preventing COVID-19-related death.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently a number of publications looked at the association between COVID-19 morbidity and mortality on one hand and countries’ policies with respect to BCG vaccination on the other. This connection arises from differences in the rates of infection in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory compared to countries where mandatory vaccination no longer exists or was never implemented in the first place. In at least 2 preprint publications the authors expressed the view that the “known immunological benefits” of BCG vaccination may be behind the biological mechanism of such observation. One study accounted for different income levels in different groups. Another study did not attempted to do so, instead exploring the differences between countries where a booster shot is given vs others where no such practice exists (finding no connection). Both of these studies did not explore other potential confounding factors. Meanwhile the press has focused on these headlines and pushed the narrative that BCG vaccination is causally linked to infection and mortality rates. This poses a serious challenge, demonstrated by the recently initiated clinical trials on BCG vaccination within the COVID19 context. This study shows that population age is a very significant confounding factor that explains the rates of infections much better and has a solid biology mechanism which explains this correlation. It suggests that BCG vaccination may have little or no causal link to infection rates and advises that any follow up studies should control for several confounding factors, such as population age, ethnicity, rates of certain chronic diseases, time from community spread start date, major public policy decisions and income levels.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, few journalists or scholars in Europe and North America paid much attention to how people or governments were responding to SARS-coV-2 anywhere in Africa. As the pandemic progressed, in fact, key agencies—from the World Economic Forum to the Economic Commission for Africa to the Global Health Security Index—all predicted or implied that there would be catastrophic fatality rates in African countries. Two French scientists shared these assumptions, going on live television on April 1 to discuss whether the BCG tuberculosis vaccine might protect people from the worst effects of COVID-19 and proposing new BCG vaccine trials in “Africa” because, they alleged, protections would be minimal and infection rates high, offering ideal conditions to test their theories. This article takes the controversy that stemmed from the French scientists’ comments as a point of departure, connecting it to African medical and imperial histories, on the one hand, and more recent histories of randomized controlled trials and global (health) governance on the other. Between January and November 2020, African nations, peoples, and pan-African organizations did better with COVID-19 than any other region of the world. Yet, there are understandable—if insidious—reasons why the continent’s success stories have not reached wider audiences: they run so contrary to (outside) expectations and belie the implicit predictions of different country rankings in global health. This kind of strategic erasure gets reproduced time and again within global institutions, creating semipermanent obstacles to African nations’ (therapeutic) sovereignty and (medical) self-determination.},

	abstract = {During the past 4 months, we have witnessed unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic that by now has affected every corner of the planet, infecting more than 3.3 million people, killing more than 234,000,[12] and directly or indirectly affecting billions of individuals.[3] The quick rise in both cases and deaths was due to the high infectivity of the virus, quickly overwhelming health-care systems and prompting physical distancing measures of historically unprecedented scale.[4] The speed and robustness of public health responses within individual countries appear to be associated with early successful containment, fewer cases, and lower mortality.[56] Driven by fears just as powerful as hopes, the humanity is now firmly united in defeating the common enemy, severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As country after country fell victim to the relentless disease, disbelief gave way to horror as the “far-away problem” became one that hits all too close to home.[7] One new fact after another emerged about our new mortal enemy – from its ruthless affinity for those with comorbid conditions to the high proportion of asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission.[4] With few exceptions, there is a striking yet expected relationship between the average recorded daily deaths per million population and both the average age and the percentage of geriatric population among countries around the world [Figure 1a and b][8910]. There may also be a similar correlation between the number of symptomatic cases and the average population age,[11] suggesting strongly that SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to discriminate by national wealth, per-capita income, or number of hospital beds per person.[11121314] It is hoped that the costly lessons of what is believed to be only the first global wave of COVID-19 will help inform any subsequent waves of COVID-19 disease, as well as future pandemic response across both high-income countries (HICs) and low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).[1415]Figure 1: Deaths per million population versus (a, top) mean age of country's population and percentage of country's population ≥65 years (b, bottom)The collective learning among geographically separated members of the international medical community is another example of the new global age of instant scientific communication and synergy creation. In this context, several group experiences helped change and refine how we treat patients. For example, the initial management approach in Europe and America was to intubate early, when the COVID-19 respiratory failure was still mild.[161718] However, this approach did not seem to reduce mortality in the affluent Lombardy region of Italy, where some of the highest mortality rates in the world were recorded.[16] This aggressive intubation approach was contrasted to a study from China where patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) as the first-line therapy, followed by a stepwise escalation to noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and then tracheal intubation for refractory cases.[19] In the latter experience, only 4 out of 318 patients were eventually intubated.[19] Similar experiences and success stories have been reported with early proning of nonintubated patients.[420] Recent reports also suggest that many patients with COVID-19 present with so-called “silent hypoxia” that is characterized by the apparent absence of dyspnea or overt air hunger.[2122] Of interest, patients with such “silent hypoxia” appear to be more likely to progress on to develop severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 within 2–4 days without early aggressive intervention (e.g., HFNC and nonintubated proning). Mechanistically, the damaged lungs have impaired O2 handling, but the CO2 exchange is still intact. Because CO2 is the main driver for dyspnea, patients may feel falsely reassured and thus do not seek emergent medical attention. Instead, hypoxia is compensated by involuntary tachypnea for 2–4 days while the lung injury progresses, up until a cytokine storm occurs, with ensuing dyspnea, elevated CO2, and the rapid development of severe respiratory failure.[2122] From public health perspective, this phenomenon requires early and aggressive implementation of home- or community-based pulse oximetry programs, combined with around-the-clock telemedicine services, to effectively intercept patients who may be entering the rapid deterioration phase of COVID-19.[21232425] To help address the impact of “silent hypoxia” in both LMIC and HIC settings, we recommend the following combined public/community health plus hospital based-management approach to decrease the need for invasive ventilation and overall mortality in the event of widespread community transmission: Approximately 90% of COVID-19 patients do not require hospitalization, and it may be sufficient to isolate mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases in their homes for 14–28 days[26] When continuous pulse oximetry is not available, monitor those showing mild symptoms at least every 8–12 h for “silent hypoxia” – also see ACAIM-WACEM Joint Working Group clinical management algorithm[22] Public education and increased access to pulse oximetry near-patient homes will be critical to successful remediation of the “silent hypoxia” phenomenon Once detected, treatment of silent hypoxia (SpO2< 90%–93% or respiratory rate >25/min) should be started according to the following stepwise escalation protocol:[2227] Oxygen through nasal prongs or face mask 5–6 L/min If SpO2 remains <88% on nasal prongs, use nonrebreathing masks 10–15 L/min If SpO2 remains <88% on non-rebreathing masks, use either NIV or HFNC (depending on availability) If SpO2 remains <88% on NIV or HFNC, consider invasive ventilation. Keep patient in prone position alternating with sitting position for >16 h/day or as long as reasonably feasible[428] Consider restricted use of intravenous fluids and the use of corticosteroids for severe respiratory failure as per recommendations,[17] with appropriate medication including low molecular weight heparin and end-organ support as per prevailing recommendations. As various hospital and intensive care therapies and management approaches take shape, so does an entire new universe of telemedicine as it comes of age. Following its inception, telehealth was viewed by some as a “modality looking for indications.”[2930] This is no longer the case, as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently adopted equivalency for tele- and in-person care, voiding the need for the existence of a prior patient–physician relationship to pay claims for telemedicine visits.[31] This is just one way in which the COVID-19 pandemic permanently changed the health-care landscape, with true effects and the magnitude of such tectonic shift to be felt for years to come.[25] In addition to enabling ongoing care of patients with chronic medical conditions, the new paradigm also enables innovative approaches to cross-border specialty expertise sharing as well as continued productive employment of health-care providers who may be under quarantine orders.[425] The current pandemic is likely the beginning of a long-term trend toward sustainable, home-based care models.[3032] As frontline medical personnel make important clinical discoveries and advances, so do basic and translational scientists. Despite multiple clinical studies, from retrospective reviews to prospective randomized trials, showing limited or no efficacy of one therapeutic agent after another, much hope remains as the resilient cycle of scientific discovery ploughs ahead.[4333435] And although there is no “magic bullet” in sight, several important discoveries were made in the areas of antivirals (preliminary results suggesting that remdesivir may shorten the duration of illness) and vaccines.[36373839] The first, and somewhat surprising finding, is the association between universal Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) national vaccination policies and reduced morbidity and mortality among COVID-19 patients.[37] Clinical trials of BCG vaccination among health-care workers are ongoing.[404142] The second, and somewhat expected finding, is the apparent efficacy of convalescent plasma in the management of severe COVID-19 infections.[434445] A longer-term, sustainable derivative that builds on the theme of convalescent plasma is the identification and synthesis of highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.[35464748] Finally, important new developments are emerging in the race to produce an effective human vaccine,[384950] although the final product will likely not be available in the immediate future. In addition to the development of new therapeutics and vaccines, there is a tremendous need for better understanding of the COVID-19 clinical disease. For example, we do not fully understand why the disease seems to take a largely binary course – for some, it appears to be a “flu-like illness,” while for others, it takes a much more acute course. The differentiation between the two “disease paths” seems to be occurring right around the 2nd week of the illness.[51] Still, etiologic factors responsible for this phenomenon remain unknown. In another highly controversial observation, tobacco smokers appeared to be somewhat protected from the more severe manifestations of COVID-19, but it is not clear what factors (or unrecognized biases) may be responsible for these preliminary findings and confirmatory research will be required to substantiate any associated claims.[5253] The ongoing recognition of new signs and symptoms, long after the first reported case of COVID-19, exemplifies the diverse number of presentations associated with the viral illness. For example, only recently was the phenomenon of “COVID toes” described,[54] and there is a growing recognition of the association between COVID-19 and thromboembolic phenomena.[5556] There is also the spirit of innovation in the face of adversity. For example, when faced with acute shortage of N95 respirator masks and face shields, citizenry around the globe began designing, testing, and making their own substitute do-it-yourself products, with various degrees of success and air filtration effectiveness.[575859] As the global fight against the pandemic continues, we must remember and persist in the hope that this traumatic event will eventually come to an end. With this optimistic outlook, we must start thinking about the humanity's emergence from the state of “deep freeze,” physical distancing, and the respectful fear of the unknown. Key to this post-COVID-19 “rebirth” of sorts will be a well-organized, well-thought-out system of checks and balances that will allow the maintenance of appropriate safety measures while also permitting the return of economic activity in the broadest possible sense. A formidable new challenge will be the copresence of COVID-19 and influenza during the next annual “flu season,” effectively resulting in what the authors are coining as “Covi-Flu season.” The costs of dual testing, personal protective equipment, as well as the need for high degree of clinical vigilance are likely to create significant inefficiencies across our clinics and emergency departments. To overcome this and many other challenges, some degree of “collective sacrifice” will likely be necessary, whether it means large-scale testing and issuing vaccination/immunity certificates, or perhaps a protracted period of continued social distancing with associated ramification of being “together but separated.” Ultimately, these difficult questions will need to be answered by citizens of each region of the globe while maintaining the utmost respect for the prevailing cultural norms, individual freedoms, and the collective societal well-being. We live in special times, and we shall emerge from the great challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic together, as a one human family, stronger, wiser, and better.},

The global burden of COVID-19 is rising daily and as of 10 November 2020, there were over 1,275,122 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded RNA viruses [1]. Based on 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with a bat-borne coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) that has been identified in Rhinolophus affinis bat species, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a bat [2]. COVID-19 is primarily defined by an acute viral pneumonia and cytokine storm leading to respiratory failure [3]. The main transmission route of this virus is droplets blown out through cough and sneezing by an infected person. The common symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath and tiredness [4]. Severe cases manifest in symptoms that are associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia, multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock [5]. SARS-CoV-2 is highly pathogenic in persons with underlying medical conditions that reduce their immune competence such as TB [6].TB, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and transmitted through infected air droplets from cough or sneezing, is one of the top ten causes of death due to infectious diseases globally, with an estimated 10 million infections and 1.5 million deaths in 2018 [7]. Indeed, since TB affects the respiratory system, it could prove catastrophic if present in comorbidity with COVID-19 [6].In this commentary, we discuss the current state of knowledge on the parallels in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis and the potential implications of co-infection on the clinical outcomes.SARS-CoV-2 \& M. tuberculosis: targeting same cells?Spike (S) glycoprotein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells. The S protein consists of three receptor-binding S1 heads which bind to the cellular receptor to facilitate viral attachment to target cells [8]. Moreover, the S protein is required to be proteolytically active by being cleaved at the multibasic S1/S2 cleavage site by the host’s cell protease furin to facilitate protein-mediated cell-cell fusion [9]. The receptor binding domain of the S protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and invade the host cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [4]. Type I interferons (IFN) stimulate the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptors and enable the virus to be endocytosed [4]. The high human ACE2 binding affinity of the receptor binding domain and furin activation of the spike helps SARS-CoV-2 to successfully enter the human lung cell while evading the immune response [10]. The virus infects and replicates in ciliated and mucus-secreting cells of bronchial epithelium, type II pneumocytes in the lungs [11] and macrophages [12].Like SARS-CoV-2, M. tuberculosis also infects type II pneumocytes in the lungs [13,14] via pattern recognition receptors of the host cells, including Toll-like receptors, complement receptors, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN), mannose receptors, CD14 receptors, scavenger receptors and FCγ receptors [15]. Furthermore, the bacterium is internalized through phagocytosis by the resident macrophages and further translocated to lysosomes for destruction [16].Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis may exacerbate the pathologies that are associated with each pathogen. The co-infection in macrophages can increase the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and therefore play a crucial role in pathogenesis. Severe infection of type II pneumocytes with SARS-CoV-2 can cause regeneration failure of the cells and lead to lesions in the lungs, accelerated bronchial damage and ultimately lung disease [17].Dysregulating the immune system: the shared story of SARS-CoV-2 \& M. tuberculosisThe human immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 by differentiating the monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages through activation of JAK–STAT pathways, an activation that is mediated by production of IL-1β and/ or IL-18 [18]. The activation can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulting in COVID-19-associated cytokine storm. Cytokine storm causes rapid replication of SARS-CoV-2 virus and results in the infection of more alveolar epithelial cells [19]. Significant elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1β and IP10 have been detected in COVID-19 patients [20]. The rapidly increasing cytokines induce excess production of neutrophils, which infiltrate lung tissue and cause lung injury [21]. Cytokine storm is also induced in M. tuberculosis infection and is driven by an overwhelming immune response from alveolar macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells in the lungs and lymph nodes [22]. These cells release an array of cytokines, including IL-1, IL-18, IFN-α, IL-6, IL-10 [23] and therefore co-infections of SARS-CoV-2 with M. tuberculosis will likely result in the production of high amounts of cytokines and lead to exacerbated pathogenicity.Although the two pathogens share some features of cytokine storm, it is important to note that the magnitude of response differs, with M. tuberculosis having a lower response. Moreover, the outcomes associated with cytokine storm are different for the two pathogens. The COVID-19 patients experience acute respiratory distress syndrome whereas in M. tuberculosis chronic wasting and slow long destruction ensue from cytokine storm.Another marked feature in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is lymphocytopenia [24]. Lymphocytes count of less than 1.5 × 109 per liter has been shown to increase the risk of severe COVID-19 [25]. It is believed that the virus directly infects lymphocytes through the ACE2 receptor and kill them leading to lymphocytopenia [26]. The direct damage of organs such as the lymphatic system by SARS-CoV-2 may also result in a reduction of lymphocytes. Production of TNFα, IL-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines during SARS-CoV-2 can also induce lymphocyte apoptosis [26].The dysregulation of T lymphocytes has also been demonstrated in TB patients [27]. It has been reported that protective immunity to TB depends on CD4+ cells through cell-mediated responses to allow control of M. tuberculosis infection [28]. A depletion of the CD4+ cells increases risks to reactivation of TB [29], and is also associated with severe radiological lesions, increased paradoxical reaction or death [27,30]. The depletion of CD4+ by TB may also result in immunosuppression, which may increase severity on patients with comorbidity of TB and SARS-CoV-2 [31].Potential protective effects of BCG vaccine against COVID-19BCG is a live attenuated vaccine that has been used to protect children against TB and other viral infections [32]. The vaccine induces immune response through production of antibodies that prevent the proliferation of the pathogen [33]. It is suggested that BCG vaccine might boost the immune system and help reduce the severity of COVID-19 [34]. BCG vaccination has a nonspecific or heterologous effect, which reduces morbidity and mortality to subsequent infections [35]. The vaccine activates CD4+ and CD8+ memory cells with nontargeted antigens, thus modulating T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 responses for secondary infections [36]. BCG also induces immunological memory in innate immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes and macrophages [37]. All these result in bystander response including enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IFN-γ, TNF and IL-6, macrophage activity, T-cell responses and enhanced antibody titers [35].Based on the nonspecific nature of BCG and its capacity to elicit both innate and adaptive immunity, BCG vaccine has been suggested as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection or to reduce COVID-19 severity, especially among children who have already been vaccinated with BCG [38,39]. Healthy individuals vaccinated with BCG will have a boosted immune system, which upon infection with SARS-CoV-2, will lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and consequently less inflammation and reduced possibility of cytokine storm production and lymphopenia [38]. Countries in Africa, Asia and South America, that are implementing mandatory national BCG vaccination for their populations, have demonstrated lower COVID-19 cases and mortality [39,40]. Although, a direct link between the low COVID-19 cases and BCG is yet to be established, it is probable that BCG vaccination induces protection against SARS-CoV-2 via trained innate immunity. BCG vaccination results in epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or NK cells, which robustly responds to and clears a broad spectrum of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 [41]. More scientific evidence is needed to establish the protective nature of BCG to SARS-CoV-2 specifically, and to which group of individuals – children and/or adults – should be targeted to realize the full benefits of this trained immunity. Moreover, considering that heightened immune response such as cytokine response is attributed to complications in COVID-19 patients [42], the potential negative effects of elevated immune response by the BCG’s trained immunity warrants further investigation.Conclusion \& future perspectiveSARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis infections have some important parallels with regards to cell entry, immune response and immune evasion. Thus, TB-endemic regions may have exacerbated pathologies in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infections; something that the scientific community will need to pay attention to. At the moment, recommending BCG vaccine for combating COVID-19 must be done with caution. Moreover, the vaccine does not offer a lifetime protection and there is paucity of evidence confirming its protective role against SARS-CoV-2. More research should be directed toward a deeper understanding of how BCG might protect against COVID-19. A thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 in the context of M. tuberculosis co-infection is warranted to inform on better ways to manage such cases and avert high COVID-19-related mortalities that are likely to occur in the high TB endemic areas.Financial \& competing interests disclosureK Tapela and CO Olwal were supported by a WACCBIP-World Bank ACE PhD fellowship (ACE02-WACCBIP: Awandare) and a DELTAS Africa grant (DEL-15-007: Awandare).

	abstract = {The rapid global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is now well-known with the first case in South Africa on 5 March 2020,1 and since then, the country has been experiencing a persistent increase in the number of positive cases. By 24 May 2020, there were 99 433 confirmed cases in Africa where the tuberculosis (TB) incidence is 231/100 000.2, 3 There is uncertainty of the impact of possible dual epidemics of TB and COVID-19 and whether tuberculous lung disease would be a risk factor for severe COVID-19. We describe the first recorded case of COVID-19 coinfection in a young child with airway compression due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). A 2-year 5-month-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative boy presented to his local hospital with fever, coughing, worsening respiratory distress, and loss of appetite 1 month after being diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) with a positive GeneXpert MTB/RIF, Rifampicin sensitive, on gastric aspirate. The chest radiograph at diagnosis demonstrated subcarinal lymph nodes and mild narrowing of the left main bronchus. He was started on a 4-drug, weight-appropriate, TB regimen at diagnosis. He did not receive prednisone at the time as the airway obstruction was deemed not to be clinically significant. There was no close contact with an adult TB source case at the time of the original or the current diagnosis. The mother was screened but was negative. He had no travel history, and at the time of presentation, we were not aware of contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. He did not receive the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine at birth due to local shortage at the time. On clinical examination, the saturations were 100% on nasal prong oxygen and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. He had a blocked nose, subcostal recession, and dullness to percussion in the right upper lobe. On auscultation, wheezing was detected, more significant on the right. He was hemodynamically stable. A supine frontal chest radiograph demonstrated confluent air-space disease in the right upper and middle lobes with a small focus of breakdown corresponding to the dullness on percussion elicited clinically. Airway narrowing of the left main bronchus and the bronchus intermedius are surrogate representations of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which in conjunction with the air-space disease, support a diagnosis of primary PTB. A lateral chest radiograph performed during the same admission confirmed the area of parenchymal breakdown (presumably in the right middle lobe) and also confirmed the presence of lymphadenopathy posteroinferiorly to the bronchus intermedius (for both frontal and lateral views, see Figure 1). He had a white cell count of 8.03 × 109/L, neutrophils 3.56 × 109/L, lymphocytes 3.45 × 109/L, and C-reactive protein of 11 mg/L. Due to his symptoms of new-onset fever and coughing, he was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. This was positive, within 24 hours, for both the child and his asymptomatic mother. They classified as cases of local spread of COVID-19. Nasal prong oxygen and oral co-amoxiclav were commenced. The 4-drug antituberculous treatment regimen, including rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol, was continued and adjuvant oral prednisone 2 mg/kg was added before the diagnosis of COVID-19, interrupted at COVID-19 diagnosis, and restarted again at discharge. Improvement was rapid with discharge on day 5, followed by self-isolation. He received two doses of oral prednisone before the diagnosis of COVID-19. The airway obstruction will be re-evaluated 4 weeks postdischarge. Consent was given by the patient's parents for publication of this case and permission for the report was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the Health Science Faculty of Stellenbosch University. Coinfection with other pathogens has been described in up to 40% of children with COVID-19, including influenza A and B, mycoplasma, respiratory syncytial virus, and cytomegalovirus.4 This is the first report of coinfection with MTB. Airway obstruction due to MTB is known to be complicated by a viral infection, causing additional inflammation, thereby worsening the obstruction.5 BCG vaccination confers decreased risk of severe childhood TB disease in high-burden areas, an effect negated by low vaccine coverage.6 Besides protection against TB, BCG vaccination also modulates the immune response to subsequent infections caused by other pathogens, including viruses, by the induction of innate immunity and heterologous lymphocyte activation.7, 8 In this case, the question raised is whether lack of BCG vaccination increased susceptibility to severe pulmonary TB, COVID-19, and possibly other viral coinfection. The protective effects of BCG vaccination against severity and poor outcome in COVID-19 infection is currently a subject of clinical trials.9 This case highlights the difficulty that diagnosis and management of COVID-19 presents to clinicians in resource-constrained countries with high TB and HIV burden. This child, known with PTB, presented with clinical symptoms that could have been presumed to be related due to either TB or COVID-19. Routine management of children with significant airway obstruction is also compromised due to the risk bronchoscopy may hold. The nonspecific clinical and radiological findings of COVID-19 in children complicate recognition. Computed tomography (CT) findings are thought to be more specific,4 but in TB endemic countries, CT scans are not easily available. In patients with complicated PTB, with extensive parenchymal involvement, it would be impossible to differentiate from COVID-19, based on symptoms and chest radiograph findings alone. Bronchoscopy has been used to confirm and determine the severity of tuberculous airway obstruction in children, guiding the decision either to treat medically with antituberculous drugs and oral prednisone or intervene surgically.10 As bronchoscopy is a very high-risk aerosol-generating medical procedure, in TB endemic areas, this has to be performed with strict indications and with full personal protective equipment (PPE).11 The indications for bronchoscopy in pediatric TB may need to be revised as full PPE, although optimal, is not always available in a resource-constrained world and may be limited to only N95 masks. Currently, it would be very difficult to predict whether PTB in children confers additional risk of developing severe COVID-19. This case illustrates that children with confirmed PTB may have persistent or worsening symptoms due to other viral infections, including COVID-19 infection, and may present with new pneumonia and exacerbation of TB-associated nodal airway obstruction. However, the rapid improvement is reassuring. The child experienced short-term deterioration of his airway obstruction due to COVID-19, which subsequently rapidly improved. Oral prednisone at 2 mg/kg for TB airway obstruction was continued for 1 month even after recovery from COVID-19. COVID-19 may result in deterioration in children with TB. More data on the effect of COVID-19 on presentation and treatment response in children with TB (including the full spectrum) is needed. The effect of corticosteroid and possible impact of BCG vaccination in these children also requires better description.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has killed over 400 000 people globally. Ecological evidence indicates that countries with national universal BCG vaccination programs for tuberculosis (TB) prevention have a much lower incidence of severe COVID-19 and mortality compared with those that do not have such programs. BCG is a century old vaccine used for TB prevention via infant/childhood vaccination in lowto middle-income countries with high infection prevalence rate and is known to reduce all-cause neonatal mortality. BCG remains the standard immunotherapy treatment for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer globally for more than 44 years. Several trials are, therefore, investigating BCG as a prophylactic against COVID-19 in healthcare workers and the elderly. In this commentary, we discuss the potential mechanisms that may underlie BCG associated heterologous protection with a focus on tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) organogenesis. Given the significance of TLSs in mucosal immunity, their association with positive prognosis and response to immune checkpoint blockade with a critical role of Type I interferon (IFN-1) in inducing these, we also discuss potentiating TLS formation as a promising approach to enhance anti-tumor immunity. We propose that lessons learned from BCG immunotherapy success could be applied to not only augment such microbe-based therapeutics but also lead to similar adjunctive IFN-1 activating approaches to improve response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy in cancer.},

	abstract = {A series of epidemiological explorations has suggested a negative association between national BCG vaccination policy and the prevalence and mortality of COVID-19. However, these comparisons are difficult to validate due to broad differences between countries such as socioeconomic status, demographic structure, rural vs. urban settings, time of arrival of the pandemic, number of diagnostic tests and criteria for testing, and national control strategies to limit the spread of COVID-19. We review evidence for a potential biological basis of BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19, and refine the epidemiological analysis to mitigate effects of potentially confounding factors (e.g., stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, development, rurality, population density, and age structure). A strong correlation between the BCG index, an estimation of the degree of universal BCG vaccination deployment in a country, and COVID-19 mortality in different socially similar European countries was observed (r2 = 0.88; p = 8 X 10-7), indicating that every 10% increase in the BCG index was associated with a 10.4% reduction in COVID-19 mortality. Results fail to confirm the null hypothesis of no-association between BCG vaccination and COVID-19 mortality, and suggest that BCG could have a protective effect. Nevertheless, the analyses are restricted to coarse-scale signals and should be considered with caution. BCG vaccination clinical trials are required to corroborate the patterns detected here, and to establish causality between BCG vaccination and protection from severe COVID-19. Public health implications of a plausible BCG cross-protection from severe COVID-19 are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this brief perspective, we outline the role of perforin in the host response to viral infections and draw parallels between morbidity and mortality patterns associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the functionality of perforin (Fig 1). We also reference known genetic disorders relating to perforin and their potential relevance. Finally, based on our hypothesis, suggestions are made regarding how the immune response may be augmented to increase resistance to SARS-CoV-2–related illness. Perforin is a potent pore-forming protein and permits cytotoxic proteases, such as granzyme B, to enter the cytoplasm of virally infected target cells. Upon recognition of a target cell by cytotoxic cells, an immune synapse is formed and perforin and granzymes are secreted into the synaptic cleft. Perforin then forms pores in the target cell membrane, which allows granzyme proteases to enter the target cell cytosol, leading to cell death.1Voskoboinik I. Whisstock J.C. Trapani J.A.

Varga S.M. The CD8 T cell response to respiratory virus infections.Front Immunol. 2018; 9: 678Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar Several factors affect variance in perforin expression (Fig 1) including age. There appears to be easier ‘perforin exhaustion’ in the elderly, which was shown in a series of studies by Mariani et al.3Mariani E. Sgobbi S. Meneghetti A. Tadolini M. Tarozzi A. Sinoppi M. et al.Perforins in human cytolytic cells: the effect of age.Mech Ageing Dev. 1996; 92: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar Compared with those from younger donors, peripheral natural killer (NK) cells from elderly subjects consumed up to 12 times more perforin following culture with target cells (K562 leukemic tumor cells), and synthesized significantly less perforin in response to a stimulus (PHA).3Mariani E.

Sinoppi M. et al.Perforins in human cytolytic cells: the effect of age.Mech Ageing Dev. 1996; 92: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar Similarly, it has been shown that the expression of perforin by NK cells declines significantly after the age of 70 years and children have higher levels than adults.4Rukavina D. Laskarin G. Rubesa G. Strbo N. Bedenicki I. Manestar D. et al.Age-related decline of perforin expression in human cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells.Blood. 1998; 92: 2410-2420Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Sex differences are also reported, with adult women having consistently higher levels of perforin than do men of equivalent age.4Rukavina D.

That is, evidence to date suggests that serious adverse effects are more likely to occur in adults older than 70 years, and are more common in men than in women. Moreover, it appears that children rarely present with severe symptoms, and are less symptomatic overall compared with adults. Another determinant of perforin levels may be an individual’s body mass index,5Michelet X. Dyck L. Hogan A. Loftus R. Metabolic reprogramming of natural killer cells in obesity limits antitumor responses.Nat Immunol. 2018; 19: 1330-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar and recognized risk factors for poor outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection include not only obesity but also diabetes mellitus (DM). Perforin genes have been identified to be significantly downregulated in obesity, and NK cells from obese individuals have shown reduced cytolytic activity in comparison with those from lean individuals.5Michelet X.

Known human disorders of perforin, or perforinopathies, have been associated with protracted viral infections (mainly EBV) but are more commonly complicated by cytokine release syndromes (CRS), which include hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome.1Voskoboinik I.

BCG vaccination in children was shown to be associated with increased NK-cell activity against unrelated candida infections and increased production of both perforin and granulysin.9Semple P.L.

Another potential strategy to boost innate perforin levels might be to consider the relatively well-tolerated drug metformin. This has been shown to increase perforin and granzyme B expression at doses used in the treatment of diabetes.10Li L. Wang L. Li J. Fan Z. Yang L.

It is plausible that vaccine history, genetic profiles, and certain current medications may all exert some effect on the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, genetic testing for mutations in perforin and related genes may identify other at-risk populations. Further data collection would assist in the clarification of such effects and therapeutic recommendations should be based on outcomes from robust clinical trials.},

The SARS-CoV-2 possesses RNA as a genetic material with 79% of the match with the bat SARS-CoV genome, which became epidemic in 2002. The SARS-CoV-2 peripheral Spike-Fc protein binds specifically to the ACE2 receptors present on bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar pneumocytes to downmodulates its expression which leads to severe acute respiratory failure. The disease is super infectious from human to human and the symptoms are similar to flu. The old aged and immunocompromised population are severely affected, and healthcare providers globally applied various strategies for treatment including the repurposing of drugs including antimalarial drug, hydroxychloroquine and anti-viral drugs.Herein, we described the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, immune responses, possible drug targets, vaccines under the trials and correlated the possibility of trained immunity induced by BCG vaccination over control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The countries with constraint BCG vaccination policy are struggling badly compared to countries with BCG vaccination policy. The BCG vaccination policy supports either lowering the total number of COVID-19 cases or the increasing recovery rate.},

	abstract = {COVID-19, caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide. In the absence of specific vaccines or therapeutics available, COVID-19 cases are managed empirically with the passive immunity approach and repurposing of drugs used for other conditions. Recently, a concept that bacilli Calmette–Guerin (BCG) vaccination could confer protection against COVID-19 has emerged. The foundation for this widespread attention came from several recent articles, including the one by Miller et al. submitted to MedRxiv, a pre-print server. The authors of this article suggest that a correlation exists between countries with a prolonged national BCG vaccination program and the morbidity/mortality due to COVID-19. Further, clinical BCG vaccination trials are currently ongoing in the Netherlands, Australia, the UK, and Germany with the hope of reducing mortality due to COVID-19. Although BCG vaccination helps protect children against tuberculosis, experimental studies have shown that BCG can also elicit a non-specific immune response against viral and non-mycobacterial infections. Here, we summarize the pros and cons of BCG vaccination and critically analyze the evidence provided for the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 and highlight the confounding factors in these studies.},

	abstract = {Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. The bacterium was cultivated between 1908 and 1921, and as demonstrated almost a century later [1], during these years of in vitro growth on solid culture media, it lost large regions of chromosomal DNA, some of which encoded important virulence determinants. This loss of virulence made it harmless enough to allow administration of the vaccine to newborns, and it has become the world’s most widely used vaccine. Today, it is recommended by the WHO for the protection of young children against the most severe and deadly forms of tuberculosis [2]. The never-fading interest in BCG is reflected in PubMed-listed citations emerging from the simple search ‘BCG’ revealing an accelerating ‘doubling-rate’ from 220 in 1950 to 400 around the millennial turn to 800 articles in 2020. Just a brief dip in numbers of publications can be noted in the late 50s, probably as a result of the discovery of antibiotics and the premature conclusion that TB was history at that time. In December 2018, a conference was held at the Institut Pasteur de Lille in Lille, France, the birthplace of BCG. This was the second international workshop dedicated exclusively to BCG and was organized to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the first subculture of M. bovis, which finally led to the BCG. The conference gathered speakers from 17 different countries in Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Australia. All continents were represented, and the presentations covered a wide range of subjects, including the history of BCG, the place of BCG in the fight against mycobacterial diseases, genomics of BCG, next-generation BCGs, off-target effects of BCG and the effects of BCG in cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. This initially unexpected width of beneficial effects that BCG has unveiled over the years has led to major new discoveries and resulted in treatments against a wide variety of human diseases beyond tuberculosis and leprosy and ranging from cancer to diabetes. The full potential of BCG is only recently being systematically explored, including the possibility that BCG may have a protective effect on coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) [3], which was not heard of at the time of the conference. The underlying mechanisms of this variety of effects are currently an area of intense investigation throughout the world and has greatly contributed to the concept of ‘trained immunity’ [4]. The Lille BCG conference inspired us to prepare a special issue for Journal of Internal Medicine by asking some of the speakers at the conference for contributions. In the current issue of JIM, we present four articles derived from work presented at the conference and two additional papers. Early studies from Sweden and France by Naeslund and Albert Calmette himself demonstrated that childhood mortality was reduced after the introduction of BCG for reasons not related to tuberculosis. These findings have later been confirmed in studies from Africa by Stabell-Benn and colleagues [5], who in this issue of JIM present a meta-analysis on the correlation between BCG scarring and childhood survival. The study concludes that the presence of a BCG scar is correlated with reduced mortality in children in Guinea–Bissau and suggests that an early time-point for BCG vaccination (during the first month of life) should be assured in national vaccination programmes. The importance of scar formation is also highlighted by the finding that the formation of a scar, which results from a short period of replication of the BCG at the injection site and the accompanying inflammatory infiltration, is much more strongly associated with the reduction in childhood mortality than just the administration of the vaccine. Finally, the consideration of revaccination of scar-negative children is discussed as a means to enhance the coverage of effective BCG vaccination in vulnerable populations. Another unexpected effect of BCG that has been in clinical practice for a very long time is its effect as a cancer therapeutic. It is widely used to treat bladder cancer (the vaccine is repeatedly instilled into the bladder) and has shown to be effective in reducing recurrence of noninvasive bladder cancer. Repeated injections of BCG have long been applied in veterinary science as well, to treat equine sarcoids, ‘white horse melanoma’, and here, Lee and co-authors elucidate the clinical and molecular aspects of the use of BCG to treat melanoma in humans [6]. The review surveys the existing knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the promising effect of BCG as anticancer therapy, including both adaptive immune responses and epigenetic reprogramming associated with trained immunity. The work further summarizes the efficacy and safety of several studies on intralesional BCG therapy for melanoma and compares it with immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated melanoma, concluding that future studies should explore the possible synergistic effects of these approaches. Type I diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, in which a dysregulated T-cell response causes the degradation of insulin-producing islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. Faustman presents her work on how the metabolic defects observed in immune cells in type I diabetes can be restored in their function through repeated BCG administration [7]. The work expands on the implications of BCG therapy for a number of autoimmune disorders. A mechanism that is discussed for the observed effects involves an increasing number of beneficial regulatory T cells as a result of BCG administration. A special issue on BCG should of course include work that discusses its use against tuberculosis, and Lindestam Arlehamn and colleagues provide a comprehensive summary of factors known to contribute to the variable antituberculosis efficacy of BCG [8]. Administration routes different from the standard intradermal injection are discussed, including animal studies on intravenous injection and aerosol administration, also providing important information on how the efficacy of BCG could be improved. The work further summarizes the search for immune correlates of BCG protection, which remain enigmatic. Of course, there are a number of TB vaccine candidates and Harris and co-workers provide an overview of the highly diverse candidate tuberculosis vaccines in the current pipeline [9]. The work also performs a systematic review of mathematical modelling papers exploring the epidemiological impact of novel tuberculosis vaccines. Modelling studies may inform vaccine trials to optimize delivery strategy and determine population-level impact and cost-efficacy. The conclusion of this work is that there is an increasing need for discovery and development of early pipeline candidates and clinical trial capacity to meet the need for effective methods to combat the tuberculosis epidemic. Finally, in a perspective article, the possible relationship between national BCG vaccination programmes and COVID-19 is presented [10]. The analysis arrives at the hypothesis that a high population coverage of BCG given to newborns results in heterologous herd immunity, which can protect a population against uncontrolled spread of COVID-19. In summary, the century-old vaccine BCG is still one of the world’s most widely used vaccines, although it is suboptimal for the prevention of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults. Novel tuberculosis vaccines are in development, some of which are based on the original BCG or novel version of BCG-like vaccines. A major challenge for these vaccine candidates is to show superior protection to BCG in human populations. It will certainly take time before it can be universally replaced by novel approaches to prevent TB. In addition, the increasingly well-appreciated beneficial nonspecific effects of BCG make it a very valuable tool for public health in general. Therefore, there is no doubt that BCG will continue its journey throughout the 21st century and gradually reveal more and more of its hidden secrets. No conflict of interest was declared.},

While the transmission of COVID-19 via human exhaled droplets and direct contact is clear, the potential for aerosol transmission is a significant risk particularly for dental practices. The objective of this brief review is to highlight ways how dental manpower could protect from the spread of disease. Dentists will be called to see patients with emergency oral and dental problems of unknown COVID status. Attending on a COVID-19 infected patient has the potential for direct disease transmission and for contamination in the dental practice environment. For oral health professionals and all in the dental team, it is important to recognise the full list of symptoms of COVID-19, as it presents now: fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, conjunctival hyperaemia, and new loss of taste or smell (Vetter et al., 2020). Any of these symptoms may appear anytime from 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough and tiredness. According to the WHO, some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion or diarrhoea. Knowledge of these symptoms would help the dental surgery staff to triage patients when it comes to spotting COVID-19-infected persons. A history of international travel was important but following lockdown of airports is now irrelevant. Patient recognition is complicated as these symptoms are initially mild and begin gradually. Some infected people may only have very mild symptoms, and some might not even show symptoms at all. As a result, asymptomatic transmission is likely. Though infection in children from COVID-19 is less common, with only a “handful of deaths” reported so far, a mysterious new coronavirus-related rare condition among young children is also reported. The presentation of a sick child with a persistent red rash covering arms and legs, dry, cracked lips, lumps on tongue or a red, erythematous tongue has suggested a link between the Kawasaki-like disease and coronavirus. Also referred to as Paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children doesn't show the hallmarks of coronavirus; it presents with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Of significance is that some adult patients may present in a dental practice reporting of loss of taste. In a case series of patients hospitalised in Italy, the authors reported taste disorders in 10% of cases (dysgeusia 8.5% and ageusia 1.7%) and mixed taste and olfactory disorders in another 20% of patients (Giacomelli et al., 2020). A young child may be brought in with a red tongue as a primary symptom of COVID-19. In most cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. However, it is now widely recognised of possible infectivity prior to the onset of symptoms. Virus shedding, as detected in the mouth or nose, could be present prior to onset of symptoms. A PCR test can determine whether the tested person is infected with SARS-CoV-2 and considered to be able to transmit the disease (a positive test) or is negative for the virus. Patients seeking emergency care could be assessed by telephone and/or video in order to triage the patients’ initial complaint. Many patients with oral problems can be managed with advice and treatment with analgesia and antibiotics. A follow-up telephone/video review within 3–7 days should be arranged for reassurance. However, a patient may need a dental visit for an emergency extraction, incision and drainage of a dental abscess, or for urgent visual oral examination for symptoms suspicious of oral cancer (e.g. a non-healing oral ulcer). When planning emergency treatment, the dentists should avoid or minimise operations that can produce droplets or aerosols (Meng, Hua, \& Bian, 2020). Management of dental emergencies during COVID-19 lockdown is beyond the scope of this publication and dentists would find guidelines circulated by NHS Education for Scotland useful (www.sdcep.org.uk). Oral diseases have a significant interplay with systemic health especially among the elderly (Jin et al., 2015). When managing the elderly, who may be in self-isolation during the COVID outbreak a consultation with the patient's GP would be desirable before prescribing over the phone. To minimise spread and protect staff, initial risk assessment for COVID status where possible should take place by phone, before making an appointment to visit the surgery. When booking emergency dental appointments, having a checklist of COVID-19 symptoms at the reception may help to inform the dentist about symptomatic patients, to postpone non-urgent therapies and to direct such patients to hospital centres equipped for handling infected subjects and their relatives, living together. Patients may be reluctant to discuss symptoms related to oral cancer and may postpone visiting a dentist during the coronavirus outbreak. Arduino, Conrotto, and Broccoletti, (2020) in this journal have recently highlighted the issue of missed diagnoses of oral cancer that may later present in advanced stages. Care should be taken not to miss oral malignancies due to surgery closures. According to current evidence, COVID-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. Dental surgery environments and procedures convey higher risks of transmission. An oral examination can generate an aerosol. Aerosol generating procedures (AGP) present risk of aerosolised transmission and high-speed drilling and ultrasonic scalers are particularly considered AGPs. Other AGPs include extractions, incision and drainage of a dental abscess. Coronaviruses can survive on surfaces (inanimate objects) and can remain viable for 3–5 days, dependent on the surface type, worst being plastics. Fortunately, the infectivity decreases with time. Dental patients could have a strong urge to spit after a procedure. COVID-19 has been found in infected saliva (To et al., 2020); patient spitting could enhance the spread of the COVID-19 within the dental premises. The same precautions should apply for all patients regardless of case status (positive, carrier or negative) during the period of sustained COVID-19 transmission. Hand hygiene should be practised and extended to exposed forearms. It is important to carry out hand hygiene after each patient contact. The appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect the dentist and staff from contamination in most circumstances. The PPE to be used in dental practices should be in line with the national recommendations given by the government Chief Dental Officer or the professional organisation to which the dentist may belong to. For undertaking any direct patient care, dentists and dental surgery assistants and other oral health professionals are advised to wear, disposable gloves, aprons, eye protection and face shields where there is a risk of saliva, blood, other body fluids, secretions or excretions splashing into the face and eyes. Sessional use of some PPE, other than hand gloves, may be rational. Challacombe, Kirk-Bayley, Sunkaraneni, and Combes (2020) propose the use of 10 ml of povidone iodine (PVP-I) 0.5% solution - an effective virucide- applied as a mouth rinse for all patients (in those without contraindications to its use eg. history of allergy to PVP, thyroid disease etc) requiring dental treatment during the current COVID-19 pandemic, just prior to treatment. Decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed after each patient and should be carried out as per practice protocols. Decontamination of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols (Liu et al., 2020). It is generally advisable to avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air. All non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be removed from reception and waiting areas. Careful and thorough decontamination practice of laboratory items (e.g. impressions, prostheses) remains the responsibility of dental practices before any such items are dispatched to dental laboratories, in order to prevent all types of cross-infection. Demographic data on the current COVID-19 pandemic suggest that the disease incidence and observed fatality proportion of cases vary widely in different parts of the world. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination status has been implicated as providing some immune protection to vaccinated communities. BCG utilises a weakened strain of Mycobacterium bovis to vaccinate against tuberculosis. Many countries began BCG vaccination programmes in the 1940s, and in particular, the Commonwealth countries have continued this public health practice to vaccinate babies at birth or at school entry. Between 1980 and 2007 several countries have ceased their BCG vaccination campaigns notably in Europe, Spain, Denmark Austria, Germany, the Isle of Man, Slovenia, UK, Finland and France, and some countries have not had a universal BCG vaccination policy, for example Italy, USA, Lebanon, the Netherland and Belgium. A global map (Figure 1) displaying BCG vaccination policy by country has been published (Zwerling et al., 2011; Zwerling \& Pai, 2011). Using European data, Hegarty, Sfakianos, Giannarini, DiNardo, and Kamat (2020) and global data Miller et al. (2020) have shown considerable overlap with the map of countries with and without a national programme of BCG vaccination and the incidence of COVID-19 infection. They speculate that countries with BCG vaccination programmes have far fewer coronavirus cases (by a factor 10), compared to where BCG programmes are no longer deployed. For example, Italy, where the COVID-19 mortality is very high, never implemented universal BCG vaccination. Portugal which had an effective BCG vaccination policy demonstrated a low incidence of COVID-19 and fewer deaths, than neighbouring Spain. BCG vaccination has shown to stimulate the innate immune system to develop “memory,” termed trained immunity, which helps to eliminate various non-mycobacterium infections including influenza (Covián et al., 2019). In view of BCG vaccine's heterologous beneficial effect against non-tuberculosis infections (Miller et al., 2020), the question has been raised “whether BCG may enhance one's immunity against COVID-19.” There are two trials under way studying the effect of BCG vaccination to increase resistance to infections in the elderly population and to try and to help prevent severe COVID-19 infection in healthcare workers: BRACE in Australia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04327206] and BCG-CORONA in the Netherlands [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04328441). A lot of pharma companies are working on vaccines and the development of those vaccines are at various stages. On 23rd April, WHO announced that seven vaccines have now been approved for human testing through clinical trials (World Health Organization, 2020). Of the seven, 3 are being tested in China, one in the UK, two in USA and one in Germany. The University of Oxford has taken the lead with a double-blind RCT testing their ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, which uses an adenovirus vaccine vector and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The trial vaccine is being tested on close to 1,100 healthy volunteers and using a vaccine against meningococcus as a control. A timeframe for vaccine development of 12 to 18 month is needed but it is believed that an effective candidate may be announced sooner. Equal distribution of the vaccine around the world would remain a challenge. As means of protecting dental staff and patients, triaging patients over the telephone or video systems, room ventilation, appropriate PPE, sanitization of protective apparel is recommended. Proper use and disinfection of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols (Liu et al., 2020). Relatives or friends accompanying patients to a dental practice should be restricted to essential visitors only, such as parents of paediatric patients. At patient reception areas, distancing measures should be carried out—ensuring a distance of two metres is kept. Dentists should keep up to date with and have regard to the latest advice from Government, the Health Service and the Chief Medical (Dental) Officer. The position may change daily and therefore it is important to check that advice regularly. None.},

Specifically, the epidemiologic evidence for decreased COVID-19 morbidity in countries with BCG vaccination programs, current clinical trials for BCG vaccination to protect against COVID-19, potential mechanisms and rationale for this protection, and the role of the urologist and urology clinic in providing support and/or leading ongoing efforts.Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the crude case fatality rates are lower for countries with BCG vaccination compared to those without such programs. Four prospective, randomized clinical trials for BCG vaccination were identified including NCT04348370 (BADAS), NCT04327206 (BRACE), NCT04328441 (BCG-CORONA), and NCT04350931. BCG administration may contribute to innate and adaptive immune priming with several opportunities for translational research.The urologist's expertise with BCG and the infrastructure of urologic clinics may afford several opportunities for collaboration and leadership to evaluate and understand the potential role of BCG in the current COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Correspondence to the letter entitled: Is BCG vaccination effecting the spread and severity of COVID-19? ALLERGY, 24 April 2020. We have read with great attention the kind contribution by C. Ozdemir et al, about the possible effects of tuberculosis vaccine with Calmette-Guérin Bacillus (BCG) on the course of COVID-19 pandemics.1 We agree, because our group has been working for the last few months on this hypothesis, with a different approach, over the ability of BCG to provide protection against COVID-19. Several studies, as also reported by Redelman-Sidi, G., are currently ongoing to determine the effect of BCG vaccination on outcomes from COVID-19, including in two high-risk populations.2 The countries without universal vaccination policies (ie, Italy, Netherlands, United States) would seem to be hit more severely against COVID-19, than in countries with universal vaccination policies and for a long time with BCG. Since 1975, BCG vaccination policy in Sweden changed from routine vaccination of all newborn infants to selective vaccination of groups at higher risk,3 and Spain did the same, but not Portugal (Figure 1). To this epidemiological observation, detectable in open access databases of global BCG vaccination policy and practices, the so-called one Iberian Peninsula paradox must be added.4-6 Indeed, it seems that the citizens of Portugal would be less susceptible to COVID-19, at least in the severe form, while Spanish citizens would have a high mortality rate from COVID-19, as protective vaccination against BCG is mandatory in Portugal while in Spain it is not (Figure 2). In order to respond to their question about BCG vaccination effecting the spread and severity of COVID-19, we argue that the BCG vaccination seems to induce a immune response also against other infectious agents,7 acting as an immune enhancer of innate immune system components. This immunological phenomenon was extensively studied, especially the induction of "non–antigen-specific immunological memory" in innate immunity cells as macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells. After BCG stimulation, these cells undergo an epigenetic reprogramming of some transcription factors; promoters of cytokine genes are de-phased or de novo created. Excluding any influence due to pollution and/or climate change,8 this epigenetic remodeling is maintained even after the disappearance of the primary stimulus ("nonspecific immunological memory of the antigen"), giving the cell the ability to respond more powerfully to the next stimulus, although not related to previous stimuli. In SARS-CoV infection (to verify for SARS-CoV-2 infection), type I interferons, by macrophages/monocytes, represent a fundamental mechanism of protection from viral infections; they induce the secretion of antiviral molecules and place uninfected cells in a transient antiviral state. This type of defense is useful and decisive especially in the early phase of the infection, but in the late phase an excessive interferon response should induce to the cytokine release syndrome. It is therefore conceivable that the epigenetic upgrade of monocyte-macrophage line may favor a more effective interferon response, with an immediate resolution of the infectious process. Another of the escape mechanisms of SARS-CoV2 should seem to be the inhibition of the natural killer cells, with consequent decrease of Th1 response (reduction of IL-12, IL-15, IL-18) and with reduction of the direct cytotoxic action of the infected cells. The improved response capacity of these enhanced cells seems to be linked essentially to specific cytokine secretion profiles that promote a more effective elimination of any infection; in particular, IL-1β has been identified as main cytokine effecting to reduce viremia in case of secondary viral stimuli.9 We identified the Italian Medical Class as a study cohort because they underwent BCG vaccination for regulatory devices, and in parallel is the subject most exposed to infection. Therefore, an observational study aimed at understanding whether there is an epidemiological relationship between vaccination with BCG and COVID-19 was approved on March 31, 2020, by an independent Ethical Committee. The aim of this study is to assess the ability and readiness to respond to viral infection by doctors who have been vaccinated against TB, in relation to their degree of occupational exposure, age, gender, year of vaccination, and subspecialists in different disciplines. Through a survey on all physicians belonging to Professional Orders, we will evaluate possible COVID-19 contagion, severity of infection, and BCG vaccination (Figure 3). Pending the ongoing trials (NCT04327206, NCT04328441), as reported by Curtis N. et al, there are four main reasons why it is very important to adhere to WHO recommendation, that in the absence of evidence it does not recommend BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19.10 This study could serve as an easy, quick, and low-cost research tool to evaluate the protective effect of BCG against COVID-19 worldwide, and how a greater number of years since the vaccination could be correlated with an increased risk of infection and with a greater severity of clinical picture during Cytokines Release Syndrome by COVID-19. The authors have no conflict of interests to declare related to this work, nor financial associations that could have influenced the outcome of the findings here detailed.},

Is to present the state of knowledge from April and May 2020 about the influence of Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin vaccination against tuberculosis on incidence and mortality due to COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. PubMed and ResearchGate databases and WHO reports were used. RESULTS. Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS. At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.},

While the fight to contain the virus continues, the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems around the world is becoming apparent. Of particular concern to urologists are data from early stages of the pandemic showing SARS-CoV-2 infection rates of 3% in postoperative patients undergoing urological procedures in the Republic of Ireland between 16 March 2020 and 1 May 2020 [1]. Hospitals have attempted to mitigate risk and conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) supplies by indefinitely postponing elective and nonessential surgery. Of the procedures unable to be delayed, the question of which surgical approach minimises risk to the patient and team: laparoscopic or open, is particularly topical.When compared with open surgery, there are concerns that laparoscopic surgery confers a higher risk from an infection control perspective, of particular importance during the COVID-19 pandemic. This concern arises from the increased aerosolisation risk associated with desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum and exposure to surgical plumes, particularly with the use of ultrasonic scalpels and electrical surgical devices [2]. Desufflation causes a surgical plume to be created, which is a source of biological contamination containing blood cells, cell debris and potential viruses. This became particularly topical during the HIV epidemic, despite the fact HIV has never been isolated from a surgical plume. Recommendations asserted that surgical teams should exercise caution and use appropriate precautions to avoid all contact with all tissues and bodily fluid [2–4]. This notion has been echoed by Yu et al. when managing pneumoperitoneum in patients with or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection [1,5,6]. To date, there are no reports on SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation by ablation, although CO2 circulating in the pneumoperitoneum may generate aerosols that contain SARS-CoV-2 virus [4]. This is particularly relevant when desufflating in the absence of an appropriate capture device. Indeed, the concerns regarding the increased risk of laparoscopic surgery led The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Scotland) to recommend in their 27 March 2020 guidance to: “consider laparoscopy only in selected individual cases where clinical benefit to the patient substantially exceeds the risk of potential viral transmission in that particular situation. Where nonoperative management is possible (such as for early appendicitis and acute cholecystitis) this should be implemented” [5].Applying this advice to urological procedures being undertaken during this pandemic is not straightforward. Table 1 highlights the conflicting guidelines and advice on managing urological laparoscopic surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic that have been published to date. Advances in both robotic, laparoscopic and laproendoscopic procedures has seen a significant reduction in the number of open surgeries being routinely performed by urologists. In particular, advances in ports used in transperineal and extraperitoneal robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy have led to a more stable pneumocavity and create a protective gas barrier within the ports themselves [7]. As discussed by Horstmann et al. who compared the AirSeal® System valve-less trocar systems with standard Versaport™ Plus V2 Trocar system in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy [7]. This brings into question the relevance of the concerns regarding desufflations increased aerosolisation risk, particularly in robotic surgery. Moreover, robotic surgery allows staff to be more remote from the patient and each other when compared with laparoscopic and open operations, facilitating better social distancing within the operating room [8]. Additionally, when compared with open procedures, laparoscopic approaches also generally allow improved social distancing between staff.Table 1.

Four papers were excluded as they did not provide recommendations on how to approach urological surgeries amid the pandemic.COVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019; ERUS: EAU Robotic Urology Section; MIS: Minimally invasive surgery; OT: Operating Theatre; PCa: Prostate Cancer; PPE: Personal Protective Equipment; RCS: Royal College of Surgeon; SAGES: Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeon; TURP: Transurethral Resection of the Prostate.We are still interrogating the safest ways to approach surgery in the COVID-19-era but there are certain aspects of the growing literature that have become clear. There is no evidence to confirm direct infection of members of a theatre team with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or other viruses, from laparoscopic or open approach. Nevertheless, the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to survive in certain environments has also been established. It remains viable in aerosols for 3 h with a half-life of 1.1–1.2 h [18]. It can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h (half-life 5.6–6.8 h) [18]. As these materials are common within operating rooms, it is important to ensure adequate sterilization occurs both before and after surgical cases. There is also good evidence that contamination of said materials within an operating room can be contained by a negative pressure environment [19].There are also questions when it comes to the fidelity of testing, with Lippi et al. documenting the limitations of the current reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) method [20] . The RT-PCR test being used to confirm COVID-19 infections was shown to have a significantly high false negative rate of up to 30% with reliability depending on the pre-analytical handling of samples, selection of primers and quality of reagents and equipment [20]. Lippi et al. also asserts the limits of detection for the RT-PCR prevents the detection of positive patients with a low viral load, either in the initial phase of infection or following symptom relief [20]. As such, it is important to not be falsely reassured by a negative result. SARS-CoV-2 has been identified by Wang et al. in clinical specimens other than respiratory samples, including feces from 29% of patients, and in blood from a small number of patients. Importantly, for urologists, the virus has not been isolated in urine to date [21]. This is pertinent when urologists are considering natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, specifically a transrectal hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy, which uses the rectum to gain access to the peritoneal cavity rather than the abdominal wall [22]. Despite being used infrequently, this approach to nephrectomy would lead to potential contamination of the access port and surgical field with SARS-CoV-2 in addition to colonic bacterial flora, potentially exposing the surgical team at increased risk of infection.While concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic remains ever present, it is important to understand the current gaps within the literature. An example of this ambiguity is the proposed utility in using Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine to improve SARS-CoV-2 morbidity and mortality. Recent studies have shown countries without a recent or current universal BCG vaccination policy observed a slightly higher SARS-CoV-2 related morbidity and mortality than those countries that did [23]. This remains hypothetical at this stage without clear evidence. At present the most significant concern for urologists during this pandemic is to safely mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection of both patient and the surgical team by considering the immediate need of a particular procedure, the approach and indeed even ports used to access the abdomen along with managing the surgical plume and having appropriate PPE and adjusting their planning accordingly.We are learning more about COVID-19 daily, and as we look toward resumption of elective operating in Australia, it is important to consider which surgical procedures remain safest for both the patient and the surgical team alike. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in urine provides urologists with some degree of reassurance when performing endoscopic work. However, when weighing the risk and benefits of an open, laparoscopic or robotic procedures, it remains a difficult decision. The theoretical risk of increased transmission posed by laparoscopic surgery needs to be considered. Nevertheless, the benefits of a minimally invasive surgical approach are long established, and these theoretical risks remain just that – theoretical. The increase in length of stay, in a high risk hospital environment after open surgery should also not be understated to a patient’s overall risk of infection [8]. We do know delaying a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer for ≤12 months with no androgen deprivation therapy for all categories of localized prostate cancer is not associated with adverse postoperative outcomes [24]. This provides patients reassurance and allows urologists the opportunity to ensure appropriate time and caution is taken to protect both staff and patients during this pandemic.Financial \& competing interests disclosureThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

	abstract = {Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide emergency and announced as a pandemic recently with variable incidence and mortality in different geographical areas.1 The relationship between COVID-19 and Bacille Calmette Guérin (BCG) vaccine is still under investigation, and we aim to clarify this matter. Bacille Calmette Guérin is a live attenuated tuberculosis vaccine. BCG vaccination of adult humans induces strained circulating monocytes having an increase in their capacity to produce proinflammatory cytokines.2 This effect translates to non-specific protection against unrelated pathogens, an example of which is S aureus and C Albicans. Also, vaccination of BCG of healthy volunteers showed an increase in the capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and IL-6 after stimulation with M tuberculosis or unrelated pathogens (S aureus, C Albicans).3 Therefore, BCG induces non-specific protection against unrelated pathogens.4 In trained immunity, the human immune cells experience metabolic and epigenetic changes that strengthen the immune response to heterologous reinfection. Therefore, BCG vaccine may play a role in the COVID-19 pandemic.5 Bacille Calmette Guérin vaccine is given at birth or/and during childhood induces a long-lasting immunity not only against tuberculosis (TB), but also against other infections. It has had a successful outcome in the treatment of TB and other lung diseases as it decreases mortality by the protection against respiratory infections and neonatal sepsis. BCG causes an epigenetic modification of the monocyte immune cells, which may anticipate protection against COVID-19. Relative to countries with compulsory BCG vaccination protocol and countries without, low rates of COVID-19-related deaths are recorded in countries with BCG vaccination policy compared to other countries.6 This may be due to the so-called herd immunity under which the virus cannot spread among people.7 Apart from the use of the BCG vaccine for the prophylaxis of TB and against leprosy, it has demonstrated efficacy in patients with various diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune diseases, superficial bladder cancer and oral aphthous ulcers.8 This is explained by the immune response mediated by BCG vaccination, which shows cross-antigenicity. Therefore, a combination of oral zinc sulphate, which enhances the immune response against many diseases, and BCG vaccination will help improve the protection from various infections including COVID-19, especially in countries where the policy of universal BCG vaccination is already applied.8 Previous studies assumed that there is no noteworthy correlation between BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 case fatality rate among the countries with universal BCG vaccination policy.9 Statistical studies showed confusion about the value of BCG vaccine in COVID-19 pandemic. One study showed that mean of cases per population ratio is statistically significantly lower in 138 BCG-vaccinated countries versus 37 BCG-non-vaccinated countries.10 A systemic review showed that countries with no policy of BCG vaccination, such as Italy and USA, showed higher mortality associated with COVID-19 than countries with long-standing BCG vaccination policies, such as South Korea and Japan.11 However, another recent study among those who were born in israel before and after the time of policy of BCG vaccination showed no statistically significant difference in the proportion of positive COVID-19 cases among the BCG-vaccinated group (11.7%) vs the -unvaccinated group (10.4%).12 Another regression analysis showed no actual relationship between BCG vaccination and reduced cases of severe COVID-19.13 As a limitation, all previous studies are observational and no completed clinical trials up till now to confirm or exclude the hypothesis. However, there are ongoing clinical trials investigating the safety and efficacy of BCG vaccine for healthcare workers in prophylaxis against COVID-19.11 In conclusion, the BCG vaccine could have a protective role against COVID-19 with lower mortality rates in already infected patients. However, further clinical trials are recommended to prove that. The authors state that there are no conflicts of interest.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human coronavirus12, has infected close to 22 million people and killed about 0.77 million people in more than 200 countries (as of August 18, 2020)3. Given the fact that SARS-CoV-2 poses an unprecedented threat in terms of transmission and mortality, the World Health Organization has geared up efforts to control, contain and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The development of a vaccine has a high attrition rate and involves linear steps of clinical trial and evaluation. For those systems that have been tested on humans previously, parallel testing can involve both animals and phase I human trials4. Although some of the potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates have made it through phase I and II clinical trials, mass availability of COVID-19 vaccine could only be possible by 20215. Repurposing of the existing drugs and development of vaccines are thus feasible options to protect people from the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Host immunity plays a crucial role in the elimination of viruses and prevents disease progression. Strategies to boost the same, especially during incubation and non-severe phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, can be a viable option to check disease severity. Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) induces non-specific protection against a range of bacteria and viruses6. Therefore, it is worth exploring the immunostimulatory and protective potential of BCG against SARS-CoV-2 infection. BCG is a live attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis widely used as a vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Intradermal/subcutaneous delivery of BCG vaccine protects against disseminated forms of TB in children and provides variable protection against pulmonary TB in adults78. Recent reports suggest that the efficacy of BCG can be improved by selective delipidation of the outer membrane or alternative route of delivery910. BCG immunization elicits non-specific immunological outcomes that prevent general infections and reduce mortality caused by unrelated pathogens6, besides amplifying responses to other paediatric vaccines11. BCG has long been employed as an immunotherapeutic agent or adjuvant for preventing recurrence and progression of bladder cancer12. A recent report13 suggests that the potential of BCG in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection may be validated among hyper-susceptible population subset such as the front line healthcare personnel and the elderly people. Clinical trials to test the efficacy of BCG in boosting the immune system against SARS-CoV-2, have been initiated in the Netherlands (NCT04417335), Australia (NCT04327206) and Columbia (NCT04362124) (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). Host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), expressed by innate immune cells, interact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of viruses and initiate innate immune response against viral pathogens. Many of the PAMPs are common among different species of bacteria and viruses. Multiple families of PRRs such as NOD-like receptors, RIG-l-like receptors and toll-like receptors detect viral proteins, which in turn induce interferons and cytokines, aiding in the elimination of the virus. It is tempting to speculate that immune response against BCG may cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2-associated PAMPs and confer immunity against this infection. Prior immunization with BCG or re-vaccination with BCG in adults can induce ‘trained immunity’ (innate immune memory), a term used to describe the possible mechanism(s) underlying heterologous protection induced by BCG against non-mycobacterial antigens. The trained immunity is a kind of conditioning of the innate immune cells, mainly monocytes/macrophages/natural killer cells, to undergo specific epigenetic changes (including de-methylation/de-acetylation) in the genes associated with mounting a robust and non-specific immune response14, resulting in a heightened recall response by primed innate immune cells upon a second encounter to the same/different/broad range of unrelated microbial PAMPs. The degree of immunological response has been correlated with the chromatin accessibility at the genome regions controlling immune response15. Regulatory RNA species, including long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs, have also emerged as the regulators of epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, besides substantial rewiring of host metabolic landscape with a predominant shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis14. In humans, limited documentation exists on the impact of unintended protective effects of BCG against viral infections. BCG-immunized mice exhibited higher resistance to influenza viral infection challenge as compared to the unvaccinated mice16. Arts et al17 reported significantly low levels of viraemia in BCG-vaccinated human volunteers challenged with experimental yellow fever virus (attenuated strain), and the BCG-induced protection correlated with increased production of interleukin (IL)-1β. Consistent with these studies, BCG re-vaccination induced innate and adaptive immune responses in adult TB patients18 also suggest its utility to renew response against mycobacteria and other unrelated pathogens possibly via induction of trained immunity. MTBVAC, a live attenuated Mtb vaccine strain, provides long-term non-specific immunological effect on innate trained immunity in addition to adaptive immune response19. Kleinnijenhuis et al20 have demonstrated that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and IL-6 remain elevated up to one year post-BCG vaccination and subsequently waned. In line with previous reports showing beneficial non-specific immune potentiating effects of BCG vaccine, one can logically speculate that BCG vaccination (or re-vaccination in countries with universal BCG immunization) may lead to improved clinical outcomes in viral or other respiratory tract infections, including SARS-CoV-2. A recent ecological study has suggested that countries where BCG is part of the immunization schedule, the extent of mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19 is significantly reduced, and may be able to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 better than those countries which did not have BCG vaccination21. The differences in the number of SARS-CoV-2-infected cases between countries adhering to the universal BCG vaccination policy and those where universal BCG vaccination is not a policy were evaluated, based on the data of COVID-19 cases across the globe (https://www.coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and BCG vaccination status from BCG World Atlas database22. It was observed that in countries where BCG was a part of the immunization schedule, COVID-19 cases/100,000 population were almost similar to those where BCG was not a part of universal vaccination schedule (Figure A). However, the cause-specific death rate/100,000 population was significantly lower in countries having BCG immunization policy, compared to those where a universal BCG vaccination policy did not exist (Figure B). This suggests that BCG vaccination-induced non-specific immunity may be associated with the mitigation of disease severity in COVID-19-pandemic areas.Figure: Scatter plot showing differences in the number of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection (A) and cause-specific death rate (B) per 100,000 population between countries having universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG+ countries) and countries that do not have a universal BCG vaccination policy (BCG− countries). The description of the different colour and symbols is as follows: European countries (sky blue square), Asian countries (red circle), Middle East countries (yellow square), African countries (brown diamond), North American countries (purple upright triangle), South American countries (green inverted triangle) and Australia (grey hexagon). The countries represented in the graph are those with >3000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, as of July 9, 2020. The significance of the two data sets was tested using unpaired, non-parametric Student's t test using GraphPad Prism software version 6.7 (San Diego, CA, USA) and is shown on the top of the plot (ns, non-significant; *** P<0.001).Source: http://www.bcgatlas.org; http://www.gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com.We hypothesized that prior BCG vaccination status was associated with the extent of the COVID-19 epidemic. Because COVID-19 cases started or peaked at different time periods and the infection or death rate stabilized differently among various countries, it posed a limitation to the current study. Our results, therefore, are a pointer rather than final conclusion about the role of BCG in arresting the COVID-19 pandemic. To have a more definitive picture, the association of BCG vaccination with the protection or recovery from the SARS-CoV-2 infection must be reinforced with the data available at the individual level. A more comprehensive comparison of BCG-vaccinated individuals on the basis of age at the time of vaccination or re-vaccination may provide critical evidence and logical conclusion for ascertaining the use of BCG in the prevention of COVID-19. A significant amount of work has been done to engineer BCG to enhance its immune-boosting and protective properties. VPM1002, a genetically engineered BCG, exhibits improved immunogenicity23, has completed phase I clinical trial in Germany (NCT00749034) and phase II clinical trial in South Africa (NCT01479972) and is currently in phase III clinical trials in India (NCT03152903) for assessing the prevalence of TB recurrence in drug-treated individuals. A separate phase III trial of VPM1002 (NCT04387409) has also been initiated to assess healthcare professionals’ absenteeism during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany (Table). VPM1002 was engineered to survive within the phagosome (unlike BCG), and was equipped with listeriolysin (from Listeria) to perforate phagosomal membrane. VPM1002 has also been reported to prevent recurrence of bladder tumours, highlighting its non-specific benefits. Another recombinant BCG strain overexpressing STING (stimulator of interferon genes)-agonist has shown significantly augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine response and protective efficacy in mice and guinea pigs challenged with Mtb24.Table: Role of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG), recombinant BCG, attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) or M. indicus pranii (MIP) as immunotherapy and possible intervention against COVID-19Alternatively, immunogenic components of BCG, such as muramyl dipeptide, can also be tested as an adjunct therapy for immune stimulation in those at high-risk to be affected with COVID-19. In addition to being broadly protective, safe and immunogenic, BCG is cost-effective, easy to produce in bulk and, therefore, may be suitable in terms of both availability and affordability. However, before exploiting BCG-induced training of innate immune responses against infections by unrelated pathogens, several potentially confounding factors such as host genetic polymorphisms, endemicity to other viral/bacterial infections and route of immunization need to be examined. Of particular note is the association of BCG vaccination, with some adverse effects such as formation of abscess and lymphadenitis and local cutaneous inflammation2829. Intravesical BCG therapy for the treatment of non-invasive bladder cancer has resulted in short period of fever and discomfort in majority of the patients30. Clinical trials for testing the efficacy of BCG, administered (or re-administration) through a conventional or alternate route910, against SARS-CoV-2 can be initiated as an interim intervention against COVID-19. The pros and cons of diverting the stock of BCG as a temporary measure for non-specific protection till actual vaccines for COVID-19 are commercially available must be deliberated upon, as it should not limit the supply of BCG for the people in TB-infected endemic regions. Therefore, it is important to explore agents similar to BCG that can act as immunomodulator. In this regard, it is equally tempting to suggest another mycobacteria discovered in India, Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP)31, earlier known as Mw. MIP has been found to be a strong immunomodulator with proven utility as an adjunct therapy for leprosy treatment25, category II TB26 in humans and in inducing tumour regression27, and possibly functions by invoking trained immunity (Table).},

Recent research found that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2%, thus allowing us to estimate the BCG’s effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Methods Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. Results The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0·9997 (CI95: [0·8002-1·1992]) and 1·1931 (CI95: [0·7558-1·6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24% Conclusions While the effect of a recent vaccination must be evaluated, we provide strong evidence that receiving the BCG vaccine at birth does not have a protective effect against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Vaccine repositioning is a hot research topic as an alternative to the traditional vaccine approach, which is a costly and time-consuming process due to the availability of previous safety and toxicology data. Multiple-dose BCG vaccine repurposing for COVID-19 will be an uprising breakthrough of vaccine discovery with safer outcomes. BCG induces cross-protection that might not be related to the target disease as innate immune cells, including monocytes and natural killer cells, contribute to this immune protection as known as “trained immunity” [1]. BCG had multifaceted protection against TB, Leprosy \&amp;amp; heterogeneous pathogens [2]. Moreover, it was repositioned as a treatment for type-1 diabetes, many types of cancer \&amp;amp; multiple sclerosis [2]. BCG vaccine accelerates the “resetting” of the immune system [3] or “turn on” immunity mechanism that agrees with its pleiotropic repurposing for many diseases. Multiple-dose BCG vaccine was used for reversing type-1 diabetes \&amp;amp; for treating bladder cancer [4-5]. While intravesical multiple doses of BCG for bladder cancer showed many complications [6-7], intradermal multiple doses of BCG for diabetes showed high safety profile [4]. As recent studies have shown that upon certain vaccinations, human innate immune cells can undergo extensive metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, which results in enhanced immune responses upon heterologous re-infection, a process termed trained immunity [8]; The author recommends that COVID-19 vaccination clinical trials should consider multiple doses of BCG. After reviewing the recent COVID-19 literature, although some preliminary studies suggested BCG to fight COVID-19 [9-12], they did not consider the use of multiple intradermal BCG vaccination (at least 2 doses, 4 weeks apart [4]) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 outbreak. I do recommend that diabetic patients should participate in clinical trials to benefit from the reported BCG anti-hyperglycemic effect [4]. What if safe multiple doses of BCG turned on the immunity and protected people from COVID-19 more efficiently than a single dose?},

	abstract = {The world is now completing eight months of the unexpected onslaught by a novel coronavirus - SARS-CoV-2 leading to COVID-19 pandemic. A <140 nm sized virus has overwhelmed even the most resource-rich, powerful and technologically advanced nations. Despite global efforts to contain it, the pandemic continues to persist, accelerate and cause humongous mortality, morbidity and unimaginable economic loss. Over 23 million cases in 216 countries/territories and 806,410 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO)1 as on August 24, 2020. With an estimated loss of US$ 375 billion to the American economy alone every month2, this virus has virtually paralyzed the global economic activities. The ‘new normal’ way of life is being silently accepted. It now appears that pandemics shall always be imminent. These cannot be prevented but perhaps could be responded better only with strategic preparedness and effective implementation of accurate, evidence-based, practical and validated affordable interventions. Implementation of efficient public health actions is possible on the foundations of sound scientific knowledge of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2. Despite extensive research on all aspects of COVID-19 pandemic, the world is still struggling with the origin of the virus, public health implications of the mutations in the viral genome, availability of a diagnostic test with better sensitivity and specificity, understanding the immune response to the virus, its pathobiology and clinical spectrum, and availability of safe and efficacious specific antiviral drugs and a vaccine. These unknowns have made it an enigmatic pandemic till now. Origin of the virus continues to be a mystery. SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have originated from an animal reservoir. Experimental infections have shown several species of animals that were permissive, while a few were resistant3. However, their role in the ongoing pandemic is not clear. There is a distinct possibility of bats being the natural reservoir and possibly pangolins serving as the intermediate host4. Genetically, pangolin-CoV is 91.02 per cent identical to SARS-CoV-2. High similarity between the whole genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the BatCoV, RaTG13 strain, (90.55%) has been observed4. Convincing evidence demonstrating animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is yet awaited. SARS-CoV-2 virus shows evolutionary divergence similar to other RNA viruses5. Mutations are a natural unstoppable phenomenon in this virus leading to emergence of several clades with geographical propensity. The role of quasispecies resulting from these mutations remains unclear and needs further elucidation. The claim that D614G mutation in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can increase its infectivity needs further exploration6. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 viruses could be classified under all the globally known circulating clades i.e. G, O, V, S and L with potential origin mainly from Oceania, Europe, Middle East and South Asia regions7. Several studies are required to fully unravel the genetic diversity and understand implications for epidemiological studies, control strategies and development of diagnostics and immunoprophylactic agents. The rapid spread of COVID-19 in communities across the globe, and resurgence (second waves) suggest the possible role of asymptomatic persons in its transmission. If strong supportive evidence becomes available, it may advocate continued use of masks and the use of other public health measures8. During early phase of COVID-19 pandemic, it was presumed to be a non-relapsing disease. New studies suggest possibility of repeated virologically confirmed infections9. Confirmation of reactivation or reinfection and their epidemiological importance are awaited. Serosurveillance is generally a sensitive tool to determine the extent of infection and immunity in the general population. Only a few field-based studies have generated serosurveillance data but with inconclusive inferences. A recent seroprevalence study showed that most of the population of Geneva, Switzerland, remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region10. Such studies raise red flags on continuous susceptibility of the population to COVID-19 and inability of the virus to produce widespread immunity. It may contribute to a ‘second wave’ of cases. The role of reduced use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in facilitating a second wave as community engagement wanes, requires further investigation11. SARS-CoV-2 has caused huge mortality among the elderly. In Europe, 90 per cent of the deaths occurred in Italy, Spain and France, 95 per cent of these occurred in elderly above 60 yr, most of whom had at least one underlying comorbidity12. Undoubtedly, almost one-third of the population of these three countries is over 65 yr of age, and their mortality is not comparable to similar populations in developing countries namely India. Unusual affliction and mortality caused by this virus in different age groups and in different countries making elderly and those with comorbidities highly vulnerable are still being investigated to facilitate development of age-specific validated prevention, prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. As the pandemic is progressing, several extrapulmonary presentations of COVID-19 are becoming obvious. These include thrombosis, myocardial and renal damage, injury to gastrointestinal system, liver and central nervous system13. Studies are needed to ascertain the extent of spectrum of clinical manifestations to assist in development of specific protocols for clinical diagnosis and case management. Children were believed to be least affected by SARS-CoV-2. The absence of typical respiratory features in young children is being observed frequently14. Complications in the form of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome are being increasingly noted. In these children, the virus could not be isolated from the respiratory tract. Clinical features pertained to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems have been reported. The role of oral route in virus transmission in children is becoming a possibility and needs investigations. This is a new dimension of disease epidemiology with uncertain impact on the progression of the pandemic14. Four technologies are currently being utilized for laboratory support to COVID-1915. These are real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of viral RNA, and lateral flow assays and ELISA for both antigen and antibody detection. The gold standard continues to be RT-qPCR. This test is valuable at the early stages of infection, when the individual may not be symptomatic. However, it has limitations of low stability, false negativity and long processing time16. Additional research is needed to determine the impact of false-negative RT-qPCR results; since false negativity facilitates continuous transmission of the virus in the community. Availability of an ideal gold standard diagnostic test with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95 per cent remains elusive. Among the alternative diagnostic methods artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms integrated with observations on chest computerized tomography (CT) findings and clinical symptoms have the potential to rapidly diagnose COVID-1917. This calls for further studies, international validation and improved access to CT infrastructure and AI skills in COVID care centres. No new drug has been found to have specific efficacy in treating cases with COVID-19. Several drugs are being repurposed. Remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir either alone or in combination with ribavirin, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, dexamethasone, teicoplanin, ivermectin, interferon and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been approved by the regulatory authorities in different countries for prophylactic or emergency therapeutic use18. As per an earlier systematic review, convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19 seems to be safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality19. In India, even a plasma bank has been established20. Nevertheless, making convalescent plasma accessible to all patients is a huge challenge. All viral infections attract comprehensive immune response comprising humoral and cellular components. Although several studies have suggested activation of these responses along with excessive inflammatory response (cytokine storm) which culminate in pathological tissue damages in COVID-19, yet there is a limited understanding of immune response and the pathways that trigger it21. Clinical trials demonstrate immunogenicity and protection for a limited period. The Ad5 vectored COVID-19 vaccine showed humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 that peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific T-cell responses were also noted from day 14 post-vaccination22. The definition of the protective immune mechanism and duration of persistence of protective immunity remain elusive till date. The uncertainty of long-term immune response has potential implications for the efficacy of vaccines. The real impact of vaccines on this pandemic will become evident only once it has been widely in use for a few months in different populations. As of now, vaccine is being considered as the ultimate intervention to contain the pandemic23. The global race to make it available to the world has been accelerated. Currently, there are about 165 different candidate vaccines for COVID-19 being developed around the world and several of these are in different phases of clinical trials24. The main types of vaccines include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (DNA and RNA), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles. To date, only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the Russian regulatory authorities25. The global community awaits data from phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of its safety and efficacy. Three vaccine candidates (inactivated, DNA based recombinant and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine consisting of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector ChAdOx) are currently in early phases of human trials in India26. Commercial production of COVID-19 vaccine and possible imports are likely to commence by the end of 2020. Global procurement and distribution of vaccine to ensure its universal access has been planned by the WHO, Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) and Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations27. India has developed a blueprint for efficient deployment of the vaccine, supported by IT-based vaccine tracker. Immunizing the entire population, prioritizing high risk segments, assuring quality in logistics and undertaking post-vaccination surveillance for adverse effects and impact on disease burden shall be huge challenges for any health system. Among the non-specific approaches, BCG vaccine is being incriminated to regulate cytokines secretions for early protection against SARS-CoV-2. Further studies are needed to understand the role of the BCG vaccine28. With a few exceptions, a lockdown was imposed in almost all the countries to promote social distancing and preparing health system capacity to respond to pandemic. In the absence of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the communities assumed critical importance in curtailing viral transmission. Community engagement, especially of poor and illiterate is always difficult to ensure29. The COVID-19 pandemic has attracted the entire focus and efforts of the health system. Usual health services to communities have become restricted because health facilities are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. People are also apprehensive about visiting health institutions for fear of contracting COVID-19. Important components of health services that have suffered most include health needs of children, women, elderly with non-communicable diseases and management of other therapies (e.g. cancers, tuberculosis and HIV) and health emergencies30. The pandemic has pushed back progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and is hampering achievement of ambitious UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is still not clear as to how the global community will make up for the pandemic-induced setback to its critical operations of major disease elimination programmes such as for tuberculosis30. Science has so far answered fewer questions on this pandemic than numerous ones that have emerged. Unknowns exceed known. Combating the pandemic shall require complete understanding of the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiological and clinical dimensions, and availability of safe and efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic tools especially for vulnerable and high risk populations. Answers to these research questions may get us closer to having reliable and affordable pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to address global challenges posed by this powerful, versatile and enigmatic virus, thereby hopefully restoring normalcy in the world.},

	abstract = {The underdeveloped opportunity to use the broad awareness of the diversity of animal life and comparative physiology (i.e. biomimetics) as nature´s own road map to provide novel insights and solutions from burden of lifestyle diseases has recently been discussed [1-5]. Since human health, environmental changes and animal welfare are closely related (i.e. the 'one health' or 'planetary health' approach), such studies require close interdisciplinary collaboration including medical doctors, veterinarians, zoologists, climate researchers, ecologists, biologists and anthropologists [6]. The ongoing coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a sobering example of the urgent need for global interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating human and animal health with environmental sustainability and ecosystem health. To begin with, it is worth noting that there is simply nothing uniquely Chinese about the COVID-19 outbreak. The explanations for why so many epidemics seem to arise in China may not only be cultural, but also a matter of its current economic geography paired with the close interface between wildlife, livestock and humans [7]. This is abundantly clear if we compare China to the United States, or Europe, when the latter were hubs of global production and mass industrial employment. The geography of blame, naming a germ after a country or ethnic group, has often been a symbol of helplessness during previous pandemics, detracting from the global aspect and unfairly labelling a country or ethnic group as being solely responsible. Ironically, the ‘Spanish flu’ pandemic of 1918 likely originated from a farm community in south-western Kansas [8]. Whilst previous pandemics were mainly linked to crises resulting from wars, the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to a crisis based on environmental pollution, exploitation of the natural world, wildlife abuse and subsequent cumulative consequences on human health. The transformative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on human welfare, socio-economic and political structures are enormous. The planet is already experiencing an extraordinary loss of biodiversity (an ongoing sixth mass extinction) linked to human activity: illegal wildlife trade, habitat destruction, pollution, global warming and over-consumption of a sugar-rich high-protein diet, superimposed on population growth [9]. As gut microbiota regulate immune defences against respiratory tract influenza A infection [10], the role of the foodome in the severity of respiratory involvement during COVID-19 infection requires attention. Furthermore, a 'normal' food supply system has developed as factory farming, with massive numbers of livestock and poultry kept at high density, creating an environment ripe for the genesis of new viral diseases [11]. Climate change can impact both vector-borne diseases, and even the evolution and progression of viruses, such as influenza A [12], whilst atmospheric pollution, due to small airborne particles, may also enhance spread of SARS-CoV-2 [13]. Thus, anthropogenic environmental changes are redefining the nature of 21st century pathologies [9], and pandemics, such as COVID-19, may not be an exception in years to come. It is estimated that in the United States alone, three out of four new infectious diseases have emerged from human–animal contact [14] and zoonoses are responsible for >2 billion cases of human illness and >2 million human deaths each year [15]. Whilst the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still not certain, most studies suggest it originated in bats and infected people were exposed via the sale of wild meat at a wet market in Wuhan, China [16]. Indeed, bats are believed to be one of the more common wildlife species that carry zoonotic disease potential for domestic animals and humans. Their special flight physiology, with high body temperatures, may have perfectly adapted viruses [17, 18] to survive a febrile status in SARS-CoV-2-infected human patients. Over the last century, human activity has destroyed natural habitats and wildlife to develop more anthropocentric landscapes [7], providing the basis for emerging disease 'hotspots' and the spillover of new viral zoonoses [9]. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans and has increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission [19]. In bats stressed by entrapment, habitat destruction, infections and climate change, spillover of the virus to other species is more likely to occur. Indeed, intestines of virus-infected bats that were also co-infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more coronavirus RNA than bats with virus alone [20]. Since SARS-CoV-2 recently was shown to infect intestinal cells of bats and the virus replicate in human intestinal organoids [21], there is a possibility of transmission to humans by contact with bat faeces, without need for an intermediate vector. We contend that lessons from nature (biomimetics) provide solutions for understanding, treating and preventing emergent diseases. Biomimetic solutions, generated from insights from the natural world, may provide ingenious natural solutions not only for chronic noncommunicable lifestyle-related diseases [1] but also for zoonotic diseases. It seems likely that the major therapeutic dilemma in severe COVID-19 infection is the combination of an inappropriate inflammatory response (cytokine storm) with reduced innate antiviral defence mechanisms [22]. The increased susceptibility to severe disease observed in the elderly and individuals with burden of lifestyle disease, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, argues for impaired interferon (IFN) antiviral host defence mechanisms. Although there is a relatively large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, viral diseases in bats are mild [18]. Since bats have developed unique mechanisms to control both excessive inflammation and having robust interferon antiviral responses [23], they may provide a biomimetic solution for the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a lack of robust type I/III IFN signatures from infected cell lines [22] and patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrate a profoundly impaired IFN-I response as compared to mild or moderate cases [24]. In COVID-19 infection, ORF3b – one of the viral proteins which is dominantly expressed – is a potent INF antagonist [25]. Coronaviruses are known to have multiple other mechanisms for evasion of the host immune response. Bats share many of the immunological features of other mammals but an understanding of the unique host–viral interaction in bats may help understand the pathogenesis of emerging zoonoses in humans. The long co-evolutionary history of bats and viruses has led to immunological adaptation of bats and the resident viruses allowing for apathogenic infection. Some of these unique immunological differences in bats that have been studied include constitutive expression of INF-signalling molecules, impaired formation of inflammasomes, absence of a number of NK-cell receptors, lack of somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and an altered INF-stimulated gene profile, which is not associated with an acute inflammatory response [26]. The links between 'trained immunity' after live vaccinations, such as Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), and reduced severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection [27] as well recent positive results in an open-label randomized trial of COVID-19-infected patients with a triple regimen including INF beta-1b [28], support observations made in bats that a robust INF system plays a key role in protection against SARS-CoV-2. Further understanding of evolutionary adaptation of both host and symbiont/pathogen may provide insights into both pathophysiology and potential therapeutic pathways. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is the best proof of the necessity for recreation of sustainable human and ecosystem health [29], and for an increased protection of wildlife in its natural and undisturbed habitat, away from close human contact. A biomimetic approach would allow us to learn from animals that through evolution have managed to regulate viral persistence, and to develop novel antiviral drugs based on the planet’s own botanical medicine cabinet. A biomimetic initiative needs prompt action as loss of species diversity, habitat destruction and pollution will prevent this opportunity to learn from the biochemical wonders of nature.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Protective variables for COVID-19 are unknown. ‘Trained immunity’ of the populace as a result of BCG immunization policy implementation and coverage had been suggested to be one of the factors responsible for the differential impact of COVID-19 on different countries. Several trials are underway to evaluate the potential protective role of BCG vaccination in COVID-19. However, the lack of clarity on the use of appropriate controls concerning the measures of ‘trained immunity’ or the heterologous cell-mediated immunity conferred by BCG vaccination has been a cause of concern leading to more confusion as exemplified by a recently concluded trial in Israel that failed to find any protective correlation with regard to BCG vaccination. Whereas, when we analyze the COVID-19 data of European countries without any regard for BCG vaccination policy but with similar age distribution, comparable confounding variables, and the stage of the pandemic, the prevalence of tuberculin immunoreactivity - a measure of cell-mediated immunity persistence as a result of Mycobacterium spp . (including BCG vaccine) exposure of the populations, is found consistently negatively correlated with COVID-19 infections and mortality per million population, at all the time points evaluated. We propose that on-going and future studies evaluating the effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 outcomes may actively consider, if not already, the inclusion of controls for underlying ‘trained immunity’ and heterologous cell-mediated immunity prevalence that may be pre-existing or resulting from the intervention (e.g., BCG vaccine) in such trials to arrive at more dependable conclusions concerning their potential benefit.},

Although both viruses cause respiratory diseases and spread by contact and nose droplets, influenza has a shorter median incubation period than does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Also, by contrast with influenza transmission, initial data for COVID-19 indicate that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0–19 years age group are low.

On March 25, a team of experts from WHO concluded a COVID-19 technical mission in Egypt. Yvan Hutin, director for communicable diseases in WHO's regional office and mission team lead, stated that “after several days of intensive meetings and field visits both inside and outside Cairo, we see that Egypt is making substantial efforts to control COVID-19 outbreak. Significant work is being done, especially in the areas of early detection, laboratory testing, isolation, contact tracing and referral of patients.” Hutin referred to the existing pattern of transmission as local rather than community and agreed with local authorities on additional measures to further slowdown COVID-19 spread.5WHOWHO delegation concludes COVID-19 technical mission to Egypt.http://www.emro.who.int/pdf/media/news/who-delegation-concludes-covid-19-technical-mission-to-egypt.pdf?ua=1Date: 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar The report listed the various steps that have been made by the Egyptian Government—namely, allocating additional dedicated human and financial resources needed to contain the outbreak, expanding the number of peripheral laboratories that are able to test for SARS-CoV-2, and with support from WHO and other partners, increasing testing capacity (Egypt now has the capacity to do up to 200 000 tests).5WHOWHO delegation concludes COVID-19 technical mission to Egypt.http://www.emro.who.int/pdf/media/news/who-delegation-concludes-covid-19-technical-mission-to-egypt.pdf?ua=1Date: 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar The report also commended Egypt's strong disease surveillance system and contact-tracing efforts as the main reasons behind the successful management of sporadic and clusters of cases before they spread.5WHOWHO delegation concludes COVID-19 technical mission to Egypt.http://www.emro.who.int/pdf/media/news/who-delegation-concludes-covid-19-technical-mission-to-egypt.pdf?ua=1Date: 2020Date accessed: April 17, 2020Google Scholar Another potential explanation for the low number of COVID-19 cases in Egypt is the mandatory—and free of charge—vaccination against tuberculosis with the BCG vaccine. The immune response-boosting effect of this vaccine has been postulated to potentially protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, given that it has been shown to be effective against similar viruses. In March, a multicentre, phase 3, randomised clinical trial in Australia endorsed by WHO was fast tracked to investigate whether the BCG vaccine can protect against SARS-CoV-2.6Agence France-PresseAustralia's trialing a TB vaccine against COVID-19, and health workers get it first.

I declare no competing interests. Estimation of the COVID-19 burden in Egypt through exported case detectionIn December, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China, causing a pandemic that continues to spread globally.1 86 countries have reported cases.2 As of March 6, 2020, Egypt has reported three cases of COVID-19; however, at least 14 cases have been exported from Egypt to four countries.3 The burden of infection in Egypt, therefore, might be substantially larger than reported. We estimated the potential burden of COVID-19 in Egypt using the approach of Fraser and colleagues.4 Full-Text PDF Estimation of COVID-19 burden in EgyptThe foundation of any estimation process is the use of independent unbiased samples. However, when attempting to estimate Egypt's burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by studying exported cases, Ashleigh Tuite and colleagues1 established neither independence nor absence of bias for the cases used in their study. This approach is especially problematic in the light of widespread news of a tourist cruise ship in Egypt exporting COVID-19 across the world through hundreds of tourists who were onboard during the timeframe used by Tuite and colleagues in their Correspondence. Full-Text PDF Estimation of COVID-19 burden in EgyptTo estimate the burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Egypt, Ashleigh R Tuite and colleagues1 used the same model of exported case detection used by Fraser and colleagues for the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico.2 However, Tuite and colleagues neither clarified nor verified the assumptions of this exported case-detection model. First, the authors used data from the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) on the average length of stay in Egypt by tourists (11·6 days), which is not accurate for the following reasons: we contacted UNWTO to verify the most recent estimates, and the average length of stay by tourists in Egypt was 11·6 days in 2018, 7·78 days in 2017, 6·1 days in 2016, 9 days in 2015, and 10 days in 2014, with no estimates available for February, 2020; the UNWTO estimates combine the length of stays of domestic and international tourists, including visitors from several countries other than the USA, Canada, France, and Taiwan; and for Egypt, a country with rapid changes in the political, economic, and tourism fields, it would be inaccurate to confidently consider these incomplete statistical data for the present model of February, 2020. Full-Text PDF Estimation of COVID-19 burden in Egypt – Authors' replyWe thank Mohamed Hassany and colleagues, Ahmed Negida, Tarek Sahmoud, and Khaled Elmeleegy for raising their concerns about our modelling study. We would like to reiterate that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in every country worldwide (Egypt included) is an underestimate of the true burden of illness, regardless of the screening programmes in place. Although we are aware that all modelling studies have limitations, we believe that it is important to rely on multiple sources of information to have a more accurate reflection of the so-called ground truth. Full-Text PDF Estimation of COVID-19 burden in EgyptWe read with interest the Correspondence by Ashleigh Tuite and colleagues.1 We thank them for their interest in estimating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) burden in Egypt. However, their model-based calculations used the number of patients known on March 6, and the numbers of patients and deaths are continuously changing. Attempting to reach a more up-to-date estimate of the expected number of patients in Egypt, we used other assumptions according to real-life data. Full-Text PDF},

	abstract = {Abstract Bacillus Calmette−Guérin (BCG) is widely used in national vaccination programs worldwide. It is accepted that BCG alleviates both pathogen and allergy induced respiratory diseases that could also include Covid-19. To investigate this possibility, we randomly assigned 60 Covid-19 patients, after admission to the hospital with pneumonia and requirement for oxygen therapy in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a single adult dose of intradermal BCG or normal saline with concomitant standard of care (SoC) medications. Primary endpoints were favorable prognosis of Covid-19 as deduced from resolution of pneumonia, viremia and secondary outcome were enumeration of ICU admissions, duration thereof and mortalities. Results Both primary and secondary endpoints were significantly improved in the BCG+SoC group. This could be seen from reduction in oxygen requirement due to Covid-19 associated pneumonia decreasing from day 3-4, improved radiological resolution from day 7-15. There were a total of 6 (10%) adverse events in the study of which 2 deaths and 4 ICU admissions were in SoC group (1 ICU admission culminated in death of the subject) and in contrast only 1 ICU admission in the BCG+SoC group. While there was an increase in Covid-19 specific IgG levels in the BCG+SoC group, there was no evidence of BCG induced cytokine storm in this group. Four patients showed localized inflammatory response at the injection site in the BCG+SoC group. Conclusions BCG+SoC administration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients with favorable outcomes than did SoC. A third of the patients were naïve for childhood BCG vaccination. This mimicked elderly patients in countries with no universal vaccination policy for BCG. No BCG related adversity was seen in this group. The study shows that BCG is a safe, cost-effective treatment that can be introduced as a standard of care in patients with moderate Covid-19 that can reduce requirement of oxygen supplemented beds and disease burden in low resource countries, with additional long-term benefits of reducing risk for tuberculosis.},

In light of the high rate of mortality associated with COVID-19, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies to prevent the infection are currently being tested. Among non-pharmacological preventive measures, vaccines represent one of the main resources for public health. It has been suggested that Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may protect individuals against infection from COVID-19 virus, and two clinical trials addressing this question are underway. Here, we report the case of a 32-year old woman, vaccinated with BCG when she was 1 year old, who was diagnosed with apical tuberculous pneumonia of the right lung along with COVID 19 pneumonia.},

	abstract = {The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in China in December 2019, quickly spreading to other parts of the world leading to a global pandemic. A number of potential interventions and treatments are being considered. However, in the midst of a pandemic, much early reporting can contain misleading and contradictory data. Thus, reliable information and reasoned perspectives by decision-makers must be attained to minimize the pandemic's current impact, as well as the impact in the likely second wave in the “flu season of 2020-2021.” One potential treatment is the use of booster doses of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine; this vaccine is mandatory at birth in many lower-income nations. In this article, using widely available and reliable data, the relationship of per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) and the BCG vaccine's use on the impact of the virus is studied via statistical models. A strong association is seen between lower per-capita GDP and lower impact. Furthermore, a lower impact is witnessed in countries where the BCG vaccine is mandatory at birth, which suggests that clinical trials need to occur to determine the vaccine's efficacy. Perspectives in safety and risk mitigation needed for management of pandemics and similar events are also provided.},

	abstract = {There is ample evidence from in vitro, animal and human studies that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine epigenetically reprograms innate immunity to provide “off target” protection against pathogens other than mycobacteria. This process has been termed “trained immunity”. Although recent ecological studies suggested an association between BCG policies and the frequency or severity of COVID-19 in different countries, the interpretation of these results is challenging. For this reason, a case-control study aiming to test this hypothesis has been initiated in Quebec. Several phase III clinical trials are underway, including one in Canada, to assess the efficacy of BCG against SARS-CoV-2 infection (results expected in 2021). In the past, BCG has been widely used in Canada but current indications are restricted to high-risk individuals and communities experiencing TB outbreaks as well as for the treatment of bladder cancer. The potential implication of BCG as an interim measure to mitigate COVID-19 is the subject of widespread discussion in the scientific community and can be considered for the vulnerable population in Canada. To conclude, BCG vaccination should be placed on the agenda of research funding agencies, scientific advisory committees on immunization and federal/provincial/territorial public health authorities.},

Global public health, economy and society have all faced near breakdown. There is a surge for identifying vaccine or repurposing existing drugs for this virus. Objectives: An attempt has been made to provide a comprehensive overview on clinical trials that are being conducted in India on COVID-19. Type of clinical trials, study designs, DCGI approval status of trials, allopathic and Ayurvedic interventions and other characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trials have been analyzed in this study. Methods \& Data Collection: Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI) was used as the data source for the study. COVID-19 Clinical trials registered up to 14th July 2020 was collected using following keywords “SARS-CoV-2, Novel Coronavirus or Corona Virus, or Coronavirus and COVID or COVID-19. After excluding repeated or trials registered by non-Indian countries 312 clinical trials were considered for the final analysis. Results: Interventional studies were more compared to observations studies, most of the clinical trials were investigating AYUSH related interventions as an effective therapeutics compared evidence based allopathic interventional drugs or medicines. There were six vaccine candidates under clinical trials in India. Four trials were examining the safety and efficacy of BCG as a potential vaccine for COVID-19. Of the 312 trials 12.50% of the trials have obtained DCGI approval. Most of the studies were phase 2 \& 3 trials, 82% trials were yet to start recruiting participants for their clinical trials. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed overview of ongoing Indian clinical trials on COVID-19. This study is useful for researchers, policymakers for prioritizing research on COVID-19 and for general public to understand and aware about the Indian efforts in clinical research on COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The non-specific beneficial effects of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination suggest that this vaccine might play a role in protecting individuals against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies propose that BCG vaccination may increase the body's immunity, thereby preventing respiratory infections caused by other respiratory pathogens. As the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is increasing rapidly and there is no specific treatment available to date, scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of already approved drugs as therapies against COVID-19, and the results were found to vary widely: from no significant effect being observed to a reduction in the time taken for clinical improvement. This study thus aims to evaluate whether it is worth performing clinical trials to examine the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. We herein emphasize the need to conduct phase III randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and quality to investigate the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. In the event that BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against COVID-19, administering it could be helpful in controlling the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases during future pandemics.},

Conclusions: Social media offer significant benefits for individual and public health promotion, especially when used wisely and prudently. They equally provide opportunities for advancement and professional development. However, any careless use of such platforms poses a formidable danger to health care practitioners. Lately, there are existing guidelines issued by health care organizations and professional societies which provide sound and useful principles that health care practitioner should follow to avoid pitfalls.

In particular, population use of BCG vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. Methods Using publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu), Results Following adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate. Conclusion BCG vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if BCG is protective against severe Covid-19 infection.},

	abstract = {The spread of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) makes the search for new approaches to prevent the infection of great importance. As one of the relevant approaches, the vaccination of risk groups with BCG vaccine has recently been suggested. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin) is a live vaccine for tuberculosis, which is used in many countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and helps preventing childhood tuberculosis, primarily, military disease and tuberculosis meningitis. Whether BCG may be used to increase the protection against COVID-19 is currently a question of debates. The review considers scientific background underlying possible impact of BCG in increased protection against COVID-19. BCG is able of inducing the heterologous and trained immunity, and its capacity to stimulate antiviral immune response has been demonstrated in experimental animals and humans. Our comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in countries with different BCG vaccination policies has demonstrated a milder course of COVID-19 (i.e., a slower increase in disease cases and mortality) in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory for all children. However, an association between BCG vaccination and a milder COVID-19 course is not obligatory direct. Other factors that may affect the association, such as the level of virus testing, the rigidity and the speed of quarantine implementation and others are discussed. An important argument against a role of BCG in the protection against COVID-19 is that BCG is given in childhood and may hardly induce long-lasting immunity. Because mandatory BCG vaccination is implemented in countries with high TB burden and because in these countries latent tuberculosis infection is widely spread, we suggest a hypothesis that latent tuberculosis infection may contribute to the maintenance of heterologous/trained antiviral immunity in countries with mandatory BCG vaccination. Four countries have recently initiated clinical trials to investigate whether BCG vaccination can increase the level of protection against COVID-19 in risk groups. The results of these studies, as well as COVID-19 epidemiological modeling will help understanding the impact of BCG in the level of the protection against COVID-19. Performing analogous clinical trials in Russia seems appropriate and scientifically sound.},

	abstract = {Relevance . The relevance of protection against SARS-Cov-19 by means of BCG vaccination is important not only with respect to coronavirus infections. That issue should be considered in light of overall biological and immunological pillars (innate immunity system). Aims . To consider the role of the lipid components and certain vaccines in stimulation of the innate immunity system, in particular, in induction of the heterogenous immune response and protection against various pathogens, including Covid-19, based on analysis of known scientific facts. Conclusions . The relevant database has been analyzed (51 scientific publications), including studies with application of various methods from immunological tests (in vitro and in vivo) to epidemiological trials. The analysis revealed the meaningful potential of heterogenous protection against various infections by means of BCG immunization, and according to some data, measles vaccine capacity. Simultaneously on the basis of performed analysis, the following issues that so far remained unclear have been identified: what is the duration of heterogenous protection; what is the optimal timing for BCG administration as related to the outbreak period of dangerous infection for the sake of decrease of its harm. The analyzed materials of that review substantiate the rationale for further continuation of the scientific studies and possibility for application of already accumulated data in order to protect, primarily the risk groups, against dangerous infections, especially in the timeframe when no relevant vaccines are available. Besides, the conducted review serves as the leverage for expected development of the new preventive medicine dimension – the systemic vaccine prophylaxis.},

	abstract = {While waiting for a safe and effective vaccine against Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), much has been speculated about the relationship between pre-existing immunity and SARS-CoV-2 infections. In line with this concern, here we discuss the importance and potential implications of background immunity, specifically the hygiene hypothesis, innate immunity training and cross-immunity, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and/or severity of COVID-19. Briefly, the hygiene hypothesis suggests that children raised in poor hygiene conditions, with frequent exposure to environmental antigens and targets of continuous infections (mainly by helminths), would be less susceptible to diseases resulting from immunity imbalance, such as allergic and autoimmune diseases.1 Since the clinical course of COVID-19 seems to be somehow related to an imbalance of the immune response, it would be conceivable that hygiene (within the above perspective), could influence the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infections. In addition, massive exposure to numerous antigens during childhood could contribute to the development of immunity, especially proinflammatory responses, which would be useful in a nonspecific control of various infectious agents, including SARS-CoV-2. This idea overlaps that of innate immunity training, discussed later. Although the relationship between the hygiene hypothesis and protection against COVID-19 seems theoretically plausible, this association has not yet been clearly demonstrated. A preprint study performed with economic and socio-demographic determinants found weak evidence for the hygiene hypothesis as a protection factor for COVID-19.2 On the other hand, an ecological study conducted with all confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Brazil until May 6, 2020, reported a positive association between the incidence rate of COVID-19 and the Social Vulnerability Index, which includes deficiency in water supply, sewage, and garbage collection.3 Innate immunity training, which corresponds to long-term epigenetic changes in innate immune cells after exposure to infection-related antigens, such as those delivered by live vaccines (e.g., Bacillus Calmette–Guérin [BCG] and measles vaccines), has also been considered a potential tool against SARS-CoV-2, at least until effective and specific vaccines are available. These epigenetic changes result in an increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which are not antigen-specific and, thus, may contribute to protection against heterologous infections.4 Although the role of trained immunity in protecting against nonrelated infections has been reported by systematic review5 and experimental studies6, its influence on COVID-19 remains uncertain. Several studies have suggested an association between BCG immunization and reduced transmission, severity, and/or deaths from COVID-19.7 This association could explain the difference in incidence and severity of COVID-19 among different age groups and among countries with different BCG vaccination policies. Other studies, however, have not found a significant relationship between positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 and BCG vaccination,8 or between BCG and the outcome of COVID-19.9 Although apparently conflicting, these findings were obtained from epidemiological-based studies and, thus, perhaps reflect the multifactorial nature of the virus-host relationship, as well as the different variables and analytical methods adopted. To clarify this issue, there are at least 17 clinical trials, at different stages, aiming to assess the protection of BCG immunization against SARS-CoV-2.10 These studies will certainly provide considerable insights in the near future. Experimental studies carried out with suitable animal models, which could reveal which (and how) the immunological mechanisms stimulated by BCG vaccine could be useful against SARS-CoV-2, would also be timely. Interestingly, in silico analyzes have found some homology between BCG and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which could have possible implications for the induction of memory B-cells.11 In addition to the above, Grifoni et al.12 reported a probable background immunity against SARS-CoV-2: TCD4 cells from about 40%–60% individuals not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can cross-react to SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Additional studies capable of evaluating the influence of this pre-existing cross-immunity on SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or on the severity of COVID-19 would be interesting. In addition to providing information on population immunity, these studies may generate insights regarding the virus-host interaction, as well as being useful for the development of effective vaccine strategies. Importantly, even if future studies prove that hygienic conditions, innate immunity training and the cross-response of T cells to other human coronaviruses may contribute to the prevention and/or outcome of COVID-19, these issues should be considered beyond the immunological perspective, paying attention to the combined influence of the several aspects of the host, the virus, and the environment. In other words, the importance of these mechanisms, alone or combined, must be considered according to the history and environmental characteristics of the target population. Moreover, even if these hypotheses are eventually confirmed, these findings should not discourage the implementation of containment measures, nor the development of vaccines or anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. On the contrary, this deepening of knowledge about the virus-host interaction would be very useful to adapt strategies against COVID-19. Finally, it must be emphasized that if background immunity was sufficient in itself, COVID-19 probably would not have reached its pandemic status—nature can help us, but it does not work alone.},

	abstract = {Abstract Epidemiological studies suggest that the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine may have protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); and, there are now more than 15 ongoing clinical trials seeking to determine if BCG vaccination can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19 (1). However, the mechanism by which BCG vaccination can induce a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) specific T cell response is unknown. Here, in silico , we identify 8 BCG derived peptides with significant sequence homology to either SARS-CoV-2 NSP3 or NSP13 derived peptides. Using an in vitro co-culture system, we show that human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells primed with a BCG derived peptide developed enhanced reactivity to its corresponding SARS-CoV-2 derived peptide. As expected, HLA differences between individuals meant that not all persons developed immunogenic responses to all 8 BCG derived peptides. Nevertheless, all of the 20 individuals that were primed with BCG derived peptides developed enhanced T cell reactivity to at least 7 of 8 SARS-CoV-2 derived peptides. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the epidemiologic observation that BCG vaccination confers protection from COVID-19; and supports the use of BCG vaccination to induce cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell responses.},

Until now, no effective therapeutic interventions or specific vaccines have been developed. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the putative implication of 12 vaccines, including BCG, OPV and MMR in the protection against COVID-19. First, we compared sequences of the main antigenic proteins in the investigated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Then, we investigated identified segments using a combination of structural and antigenicity prediction tools to assess their immunogenic effect. Results : A total of 14 highly similar segments were identified in investigated vaccines. After mapping on S and N proteins and analysis of the antigenicity prediction, three segments, in Hepatitis B, Tetanus and Measles proteins showed structural and antigenic properties that can induce possible putative protective effect. Conclusions : HBV, Tetanus and Measles vaccines should constitute a good candidate for a clinical trial to evaluate their real protective effect against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major risk factors for COVID-19 complications as it is one of the chronic immune-compromising conditions especially if patients have uncontrolled diabetes, poor HbA1c and/or irregular blood glucose levels. Diabetic patients' mortality rates with COVID-19 are higher than those of cardiovascular or cancer patients. Recently, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has shown successful results in reversing diabetes in both rats and clinical trials based on different mechanisms from aerobic glycolysis to beta cells regeneration. BCG is a multi-face vaccine that has been used extensively in protection from tuberculosis (TB) and leprosy and has been repositioned for treatment of bladder cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Recently, COVID-19 epidemiological studies confirmed that universal BCG vaccination reduced morbidity and mortality in certain geographical areas. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies that have shown low numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Some countries have started clinical trials that included a single dose BCG vaccine as prophylaxis from COVID-19 or an attempt to minimize its side effects. This proposed research aims to use BCG vaccine as a double-edged weapon countering both COVID-19 and diabetes, not only as protection but also as therapeutic vaccination. The work includes a case study of regenerated pancreatic beta cells based on improved C-peptide and PCPRI laboratory findings after BCG vaccination for a 9 year old patient. The patient was re-vaccinated based on a negative tuberculin test and no scar at the site of injection of the 1st BCG vaccination at birth. The authors suggest and invite the scientific community to take into consideration the concept of direct BCG re-vaccination (after 4 weeks) because of the reported gene expressions and exaggerated innate immunity consequently. As the diabetic MODY-5 patient (mutation of HNF1B, Val2Leu) was on low dose Riomet® while eliminating insulin gradually, a simple analytical method for metformin assay was recommended to ensure its concentration before use as it is not approved yet by the Egyptian QC labs.},

We leveraged publicly available databases and unsupervised machine learning, adjusting for established confounders designated a priori, to assign countries into similar clusters. The primary outcome was the association of deaths per million related to COVID-19 (CSM) 30 days after each included country reported 100 cases with several factors including vaccination. Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. This protocol details the statistical analyses used to establish an association between BCG vaccination and CSM, which includes : Definition of the target function, data processing, exploratory factor analysis for variable selection, k-means clustering and step wise linear regression for validation. This protocol is differentiated from previous works on the same subject by its' comprehensive nature which considers the effect of several confounding variables while studying the association between BCG vaccination and CSM. There are still several potential measured and unmeasured confounding variables which could not be included in this study. It is also unclear if the protection from neonatal vaccination with BCG is transferable to those receiving vaccination as an adult and how long such protection lasts. The authors advise caution against routine BCG vaccination for the prevention of COVID-19 until prospective trials are completed.},

	abstract = {Tim Robinson found out that he had prostate cancer in March 2020, just as the United Kingdom went into lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was told that he had a small, localised but potentially aggressive cancer that would require radical treatment. Over the next few weeks he had telephone consultations with specialists in surgery, radiotherapy and in focused ultrasound, at the end of which, in early April, in consultation with his doctors at University College London Hospital (UCLH), he determined that surgery was the most appropriate treatment. He was anxious to get on with the treatment for his cancer, but by then the UK in general and London in particular was reeling from the large numbers of COVID-19 patients in hospital. He was told that his surgery would be delayed and he was started on hormone therapy until such time that it was safe for surgery to proceed. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of effects upon urological practice. While the timing and severity of the peak of the pandemic has varied from country to country, the response of the medical community has been broadly similar everywhere. The management of patients with COVID-19 has taken precedence over almost everything else and urologists have been seconded to help with their care. At the same time, the general public appears to have become slightly scared of hospitals with emergency attendances markedly reduced. In England, attendances at Accident and Emergency departments fell by over 50% from over 2.1 million in January to just over 900 000 in April [https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/ae-attendances-and-emergency-admissions-2020-21/]. In many countries the lack of ventilators resulted in surgical anaesthetic machines being repurposed, with theatre suites becoming impromptu intensive care units and with almost all elective surgery, including cancer surgery, being cancelled or delayed. At UCLH the response to this crisis in cancer care, which was mirrored in many hospitals around the world, was to create a “super-cold” site that was physically separate from the acute hospital, where only patients who had self-isolated for two weeks and who had been proven by testing to be virus-free, were admitted. ‘UCLH pulled out all the stops and when you're in other people's hands you just have to get on with it’ Tim Robinson was able to benefit from this facility, being admitted on 30th May for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and being discharged home the following day. Although his experience was different to any other hospital contact that he'd ever had before, given that all the medical and nursing staff wore gowns, masks, gloves (and often visors), in his words “UCLH pulled out all the stops and when you're in other people's hands you just have to get on with it”. The results of the first 500 surgical patients treated in this super-cold site have just been published [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.10.20115543v1] with a 30-day all-cause mortality of 3/500, with 10 patients being diagnosed with COVID-19, and no patient dying of COVID-19. In addition to “cold site surgery” COVID-19 has necessitated other, different ways of providing medical care. Urological societies around the world have developed guidelines with the aim of prioritising urological surgery. Broadly speaking, the treatment of invasive bladder cancer, renal cancer, testicular cancer and penile cancer has been prioritised together with urological emergencies and obstructing ureteric calculi. In contrast, patients requiring prostate cancer surgery have found their treatment at least paused, while surgery for benign urological problems has almost ceased, at least for the time being [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456920301553]. Requirements for social distancing have led to widespread and rapid introduction of virtual consultations and telemedicine. As lockdown measures begin to ease the real challenge for the profession is to identify which patients really need face-to-face consultations, an issue that is particularly pertinent in patients consenting for surgery. One silver lining has been that the threat posed by COVID-19 has stimulated international collaborative research like never before. While the general public has tended to focus upon the various attempts to develop a vaccine, one of the biggest concerns for surgeons were the early reports from Wuhan suggesting extremely high mortality for surgical patients developing COVID-19 infection in the perioperative period. COVIDSurg is an international, prospective, observational study of outcomes for patients developing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the peri-surgical period that has been run by the GlobalSURG collaborative team based at the University of Birmingham, UK. As of 30th July 2020, 41 500 participants had been registered (largely by surgical trainees) in 1005 centres in 86 countries and the first key data to come from COVIDSurg was published in The Lancet in May [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31182-X/fulltext]. It showed that patients having surgery who have SARS-CoV-2 infection or who develop it in the immediate post-operative period had a 30-day mortality rate of 24%. Professor Grant Stewart from the University of Cambridge, who leads the Urology element of COVIDSurg points out that “This study of patients with peri-surgical COVID-19 infection has identified specific risk factors for death including male gender, age over 70 years, ASA grade 3-5, cancer surgery and emergency surgery”. Analysis of so-called “big data” has also provided insight into many aspects of COVID-19. The OpenSAFELY trial, using a health analytics platform covering 40% of all patients in England demonstrated similar risk factors for death from COVID-19 including older age, deprivation, diabetes, severe asthma and ethnicity [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2521-4]. It is clear that even after adjustment for other factors, compared with people of white ethnicity, Black and South Asian people have a higher mortality risk. ‘Black and South Asian people have a higher mortality risk’ Similar use of big data suggests that BCG, a substance well known to urologists, might potentially be a useful agent in the fight against COVID-19. The finding that incidence of COVID-19 is almost ten-fold lower in countries with BCG vaccination programmes compared to those that do not have such a program [Hegarty PK, Sandoval M, Dinardo AR, Zafikiris H, Kamat AM. National programs of BCG vaccinations are associated with lower reported incidence and mortality from COVID-19. PLoS medicine. 2020 (in press)] suggests that somehow BCG might provide some additional immune-stimulatory protection against COVID-19. This has resulted in a number of trials being set up to test this hypothesis. In an Australian study called the BCG Vaccination to Protect Healthcare Workers Against COVID-19 (BRACE) trial (NCT04327206) over 4000 healthcare workers in Australia will be randomized to receive either a single dose of BCG vaccination or no vaccine, with subsequent follow-up over 12 months to determine the incidence of COVID-19. The BCG As Defense Against SARS-COV-2 (BADAS) trial is similarly investigating BCG vaccination to protect healthcare workers against COVID-19 with a similar design although there will also be a focus on high-risk (elderly, obese, increased comorbidities) healthcare workers in the United States. In the early stages of the pandemic, urological trainees have often found themselves reallocated to the care of patients with COVID-19. As a consequence, their surgical training has suffered, with reduced patient contact time, reduced surgical exposure and reduced urological experience [https://www.auajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1097/JU.0000000000001155]. There has been much greater use of webinars and online education and in many countries certification examinations of been cancelled, with potential workforce consequences for the immediate future. The requirements of social distancing have resulted in the cancellation of almost all major urological conferences in 2020 although some societies have run virtual meetings using webcasts and webinars. However, given that these meetings have historically been a major source of income for many societies through advertising, commercial sponsorship and income from attendees, repeated cancellation of these meetings in future years might potentially affect the financial viability of these organisations. ‘The “new normal” appears to include the need for super-cold surgical centres with increased use of telemedicine’ COVID-19 has affected the delivery of healthcare around the world and will continue to do so some time to come. The “new normal” appears to include the need for super-cold surgical centres with increased use of telemedicine, but it has also stimulated international collaborative research with potential benefits for the future. Amid these enormous changes, there are many patients like Tim Robinson, who have urological disease and who require the best treatment available. Happily he is now recovering from his recent surgery, thankful for the care provided for him at UCLH. Despite the additional difficulties and precautions that he endured, he is delighted that his cancer has been treated effectively and safely.},

	abstract = {Dear Editor,We read the article on BCG vaccination policy and COVID-19 spread by Ozdemir et al. with interest and found it very thoughtful.1 Our few concerns are as follows.Firstly, the authors have classified the countries in two groups according to the presence or absence of recent routine childhood BCG vaccination policy. The countries having universal BCG coverage above 90% previously and stopped routine vaccination practice in the last one or two decades only (Czechia, Finland, France, Ireland, Norway, Slovakia, United Kingdom) were classified into the countries with “no BCG-vaccination policy”. On the contrary, some of the countries with routine BCG vaccination policy but poor coverage (Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan) were included in the category of countries following “routine BCG-vaccination policy”. Do the authors mean to confer that the protection offered by BCG (by its non-specific effects on immunity) is sustained for one to two decades only post vaccination and the actual immunization coverage of a country does not play a role? In that scenario, BCG vaccination shall be protective for children only (the least-affected age-group with COVID-19), whereas the adults and geriatric population (most-affected) will not be benefitted by it against COVID-19. Such classification (according to recent BCG vaccination status) that completely ignores the previous vaccination status, actual BCG-vaccination coverage, and generalizes the results across all age-groups is scientifically wrong and leads to false conclusions. Therefore, an age-specific comparison of COVID-19 and BCG immunization coverage might be more meaningful.2Secondly, the authors did not adjust for any confounding factors like the number of tests done at that time, population demographics, co-morbidities, health infrastructure, reporting bias, etc. (though they mentioned it in limitations) that can significantly alter the results.3 A recent study observed positive correlation (opposite to what we think) between the COVID-19 related parameters (cases, death-rate, and case-fatality rate) and BCG vaccination coverage of various countries across the span of four decades. However, with adjustment of confounders, there was actually no correlation between COVID-19 and BCG coverage.4Thirdly, at the time of analysis (April 16, 2020) the pandemic was limited to the northern hemisphere which now has rapidly evolved. For now, four (India, Brazil, Russia, Peru) out of the five most affected countries have routine BCG vaccination policy with more than 90% coverage.5,6 Therefore, the analysis favouring BCG vaccination in the initial stages of pandemic was too early to predict and was affected by the limited spread of COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the correlation between BCG coverage (2010-2018) and COVID-19 related parameters (Cases per million, and deaths per million) of various countries at two different time-points (March 01, 2020, and June 29, 2020) using various datasets.5,6 We observed a weak but significant positive correlation (spearmen rho= +0.2-0.4, p< 0.05) between the BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 cases and deaths(as of March 01, 2020). However, this correlation was not seen on June 29, 2020 (Table 1).Based upon the above facts and observations, we conclude that as of now there is no correlation between recent BCG vaccination coverage of a country and COVID-19. As the protective efficacy may not last beyond childhood, we should not equate the childhood vaccination policy of a country with the recent vaccination being done in ongoing trials. Until we have the results of ongoing randomized clinical trials, routine use of BCG vaccine in COVID-19 management should be discouraged and restricted to research purpose only.},

	abstract = {Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is expected to continue to cause worldwide fatalities until the World population develops ‘herd immunity’, or until a vaccine is developed and used as a prevention. However, the vaccine may prove ineffective due to rapid changes in viral antigenic determinants. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been recognized for its beneficial effects on the immune system, and it is currently in being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19. However, BCG shortages may affect clinical decisions regarding the prioritization of BCG to protect from viral infections, hence, small-molecule BCG-mimics will be valuable alternatives. Methods. We developed and applied a systems biology workflow capable of identifying antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity and impact viral disease pathways to prevent the fatal consequences of COVID-19. Results. Our results indicate that BCG and small-molecule BCG-mimics affect the production and maturation of naïve T cells, which results in enhanced long-lasting innate immune responses to tackle novel viruses. Our workflow identified several antiviral drugs including raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence BCG mimics. Top hits including emetine and lopinavir were validated to inhibit the growth of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Conclusions. Herein, we provide systems biology support for using BCG as a protection measure from the lethal consequences of emergent viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We also provide systems biology evidence that certain small molecule drugs could mimic the effects of BCG and serve as alternatives to BCG.},

	abstract = {The spread of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) makes the search for new approaches to prevent the infection of great importance. As one of the relevant approaches, the vaccination of risk groups with BCG vaccine has recently been suggested. BCG (Mycobacterium bovis, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) is a live vaccine for tuberculosis, which is used in many countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and helps preventing childhood tuberculosis, primarily, military disease and tuberculosis meningitis. Whether BCG may be used to increase the protection against COVID-19 is currently a question of debates. The review considers scientific background underlying possible impact of BCG in increased protection against COVID-19. BCG is able of inducing the heterologous and trained immunity, and its capacity to stimulate antiviral immune response has been demonstrated in experimental animals and humans. Our comparison of the dynamics of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality in countries with different BCG vaccination policies has demonstrated a milder course of COVID-19 (i.e., a slower increase in disease cases and mortality) in countries where BCG vaccination is mandatory for all children. However, an association between BCG vaccination and a milder COVID-19 course is not obligatory direct. Other factors that may affect the association, such as the level of virus testing, the rigidity and the speed of quarantine implementation and others are discussed. An important argument against a role of BCG in the protection against COVID-19 is that BCG is given in childhood and may hardly induce long-lasting immunity. Because mandatory BCG vaccination is implemented in countries with high TB burden and because in these countries latent tuberculosis infection is widely spread, we suggest a hypothesis that latent tuberculosis infection may contribute to the maintenance of heterologous/trained antiviral immunity in countries with mandatory BCG vaccination. Four countries have recently initiated clinical trials to investigate whether BCG vaccination can increase the level of protection against COVID-19 in risk groups. The results of these studies, as well as COVID-19 epidemiological modeling will help understanding the impact of BCG in the level of the protection against COVID-19. Performing analogous clinical trials in Russia seems appropriate and scientifically sound.},

	url = {http://repository2.uph.edu/1343/},
	year = {2020},
	abstract = {Researchers are investigating whether the anti-turberculosis vaccine bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which appears to protect recipients from other respiratory infections, could protect against COVID-19. Recent research suggests COVID-19’s impact is more severe — with more illness and more deaths — in countries that do not routinely administer the BCG vaccine, which has been used since 1921 to prevent tuberculosis infection. The Serum Institute in India started large-scale clinical trials in April, testing 6,000 “high-risk” individuals, including health-care workers and close contact infected patients. Researchers in Australia and Europe are also investigating whether BCG protects individuals at high-risk of serious COVID-19 infection, such as the elderly and health-care workers. Indonesia is one of 17 countries in the world that produce BCG vaccine. It should also perform large-scale clinical trials testing BCG as a COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 in countries with universal BCG vaccine COVID-19’s impact on both the number of cases and deaths varies widely across countries. It’s influenced by factors such as testing capabilities, demography, the economy, and the quality of health-care systems and lockdown measures. Another factor that might partially explain the variation is whether a country has a universal childhood BCG vaccination program. We have compiled the latest data comparing countries’ BCG vaccination programs with their COVID-19 cases and mortality up to June 3. The data indicates countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and the US) have been more severely affected, with a higher number of cases and deaths, compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG programs. This is despite the fact these countries are considered to be high income countries. The data also suggests countries with a universal BCG vaccination program had a reduced number of report COVID-19 cases. The combination of reduced illness and death makes BCG vaccination a potential new tool in the fight against COVID-19. Association between BCG Vaccination and death from COVID-19 Deaths per million as of June 3 are shown in the table above. . Data adapted from Miller A, et al Correlation between universal BCG vaccination policy and reduced morbidity and mortality for COVID-19: an epidemiological study, MedRvix, 2020 and www.worldometers.info/coronavirus Countries that have not had a universal BCG policy currently have the highest number of COVID-19 death per million inhabitants. The high death rate in countries such as Spain, Switzerland, and Sweden might be attributed to the cessation of universal BCG vaccination in the 1980s. What Indonesia should do It is important to note research on COVID-19 is extremely fluid, with different countries at different stages of the pandemic. And the data need to be updated and analysed accordingly. While the World Health Organization stated there is yet no evidence on the effectiveness of BCG vaccination on COVID-19, the organisation is closely following two clinical trials in Australia and Netherland. However, given the potential role of BCG and the strategic importance of protection against COVID-19, we recommend Indonesia to: explore the potential role of BCG by running its own clinical trials rapidly employ a BCG booster policy, especially for high-risk groups such as health- care workers prepare to expand BCG production, including securing raw materials, to support the supply of BCG vaccination domestically and internationally. Indonesia is one of 17 countries that has the capability to manufacture BCG vaccine. It is also of ten countries that are supplying beyond domestic counties. The manufacturer in Indonesia is the state-owned enterprise Biofarma. Since 1999, Indonesia has carried out BCG vaccinations for children – due to a high risk of tuberculosis. It’s estimated BCG coverage is at 92.2% for newly born infants (0-2 months). Every year nearly 100 million children receive BCG vaccine. www.shutterstock.com However, tuberculosis incidence is at 395 per 100,000, which is still considerably high. Coverage for poor households might be lower. It’s important Indonesia begins a BCG booster program. Building trained immunity Historically, researchers design vaccines by identifying the “perfect” antigen, molecules that generates long-term, infection-specific responses by the body’s immune system. This then provides immunity on re-encounter with the same disease-causing agent. However, this approach can take months to years to develop. And it has yet to lead to a successful vaccine against coronaviruses despite efforts against SARS and MERS since 2003. Another approach is to broadly boost the body’s immune system to fight infection by triggering a form of “non-specific” immune memory, called trained immunity. Trained immunity can arm cells against a broad range of infectious diseases. BCG is a weakened live bacteria (Mycobacterium bovis), and appears to trigger this form of immunity. A large body of data suggests BCG vaccination may have benefits beyond the prevention of tuberculosis. This includes protection from respiratory infections unrelated to tuberculosis, as well as a reduced risk of death from such infections. Recent work indicates BCG vaccination re-programmes the body’s immunity and has been linked to enhanced protection against respiratory infections. Given the low risk and high potential benefit, Indonesia should quickly enact BCG booster programs and increase its capacity to mass-produce BCG vaccine. It should also start large-scale clinical trials to test whether BCG can protect against COVID-19.},

A randomised controlled trial, the phase III ACTIVATE trial, assessed whether BCG may have similar effects in the elderly.1 Hospitalised elderly patients (n = 198) were given BCG or placebo vaccine on the day of hospital discharge and were followed up for 12 months for new infections. Because of the advent of COVID-19, an interim analysis was performed which found BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection (from a median of 11 weeks after placebo to 16 weeks after BCG). The incidence of new infections was reduced from 42.3% (95% confidence interval 31.9–53.4%) after placebo to 25.0% (95% confidence interval 16.4–36.1%) after BCG (Fig. 1). Most of the protection was against respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, P = 0.013). No difference in the frequency of adverse effects was found. These data show BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections. Randomised controlled trials are underway in the Netherlands and Australia to assess whether BCG vaccine reduces the incidence and severity of COVID-19 in health-care workers,2 but the ACTIVATE trial gives some hope that BCG could protect the elderly against COVID-19.

	abstract = {Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is expected to continue to cause worldwide fatalities until the World population develops ‘herd immunity’, or until a vaccine is developed and used as a prevention. However, the vaccine may prove ineffective due to rapid changes in viral antigenic determinants. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been recognized for its beneficial effects on the immune system, and it is currently in being tested in clinical trials for COVID-19. However, BCG shortages may affect clinical decisions regarding the prioritization of BCG to protect from viral infections, hence, small-molecule BCG-mimics will be valuable alternatives. Methods. We developed and applied a systems biology workflow capable of identifying antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity and impact viral disease pathways to prevent the fatal consequences of COVID-19. Results. Our results indicate that BCG and small-molecule BCG-mimics affect the production and maturation of naïve T cells, which results in enhanced long-lasting innate immune responses to tackle novel viruses. Our workflow identified several antiviral drugs including raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence BCG mimics. Top hits including emetine and lopinavir were validated to inhibit the growth of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Conclusions. Herein, we provide systems biology support for using BCG as a protection measure from the lethal consequences of emergent viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We also provide systems biology evidence that certain small molecule drugs could mimic the effects of BCG and serve as alternatives to BCG.},

	abstract = {Amidst the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a hope for a vaccine to provide effective herd immunity for everyone’s lives to return to normal. Several COVID-19 vaccines are under way, some of which have recently entered Phase III trials. Meanwhile, an age-old treatment in daily urological practice may find a novel role in the world’s battle against COVID-19, until a COVID-19-specific vaccine is developed. Intravesical BCG is well-known to all urologists for more than four decades as the ‘gold-standard’ adjuvant treatment to prevent tumour recurrence and progression amongst patients with high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, BCG is foremost, an anti-tuberculosis vaccine. In addition to its protection against tuberculosis, some studies suggest that BCG vaccination might provide heterologous beneficial protection against unrelated infections, especially respiratory and viral infections in childhood. The mechanism is called ‘trained immunity’ [1]. A recent article in the 10 September 2020 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine remarkably details this concept of trained immunity, which is a de facto innate immune memory. The innate immune system, comprising among others of macrophages, natural killer cells and neutrophils, was supposed to have no such memory in contrast to the ‘adaptive’ immune system (T cells and antibody producing B cells). When vaccinated either with BCG or with other microbial components, subjects can see the baseline tone of their innate immunity increase, what Mantovani and Netea [1] call as leaving ‘an epigenetic scar’. The long-term induction of a memory of the innate immune system has been shown to be due to transcriptomic and epigenetic changes affecting myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. The placebo-controlled Phase III randomised control trial ACTIVATE (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03296423), recently published in Cell on 1 September 2020, sought to explore whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly compared to previous studies that had suggested protection against infections other than tuberculosis in children. In this trial, patients (n = 198, mean age ~80 years) were randomised to either BCG or placebo at hospital discharge and followed for 1 year. In this interim analysis, BCG vaccination reduced the incidence of new infections (25% for BCG [95% CI 16–36%] vs 42% for placebo [95% CI 32–53%]), primarily respiratory tract infections, and with no difference in adverse effects between groups. Furthermore, BCG was able to trigger a robust, non-specific, trained immunity compared to individuals who received the placebo vaccine [2]. While cross-sectional ecological studies need to be interpreted with caution, as there may be multiple unmeasured confounders, the geographical map of European countries less affected by COVID-19 on 22 March 2020 showed some overlap with the map of countries with national BCG vaccination programmes [3]. Given these encouraging immunological data and hypothesis-generating epidemiological data, BCG vaccination has logically been suggested as a possible agent to prevent, or decrease, the severity of COVID-19 [4]. At least 12 randomised studies worldwide are under way to investigate this possibility (Table 1), particularly in protecting front-line workers, including the BRACE trial in Australia (BCG Vaccination to Protect Healthcare Workers Against COVID-19, NCT04327206) and the BADAS (BCG As Defense Against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2] Study) in the USA (BCG Vaccine for Health Care Workers as Defense Against COVID 19, NCT04348370). Several of these trials are led by, or have active support, from urologists. Dr Ashish Kamat from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in the USA is one of principal investigators for BADAS (http://bcgbadas.org/). Improved vaccination strategies against tuberculosis have included new recombinant BCG (rBCG). The most clinically advanced vaccine is VPM1002, developed at the Max Plank Institute in Berlin. In this rBCG, the urease C gene is replaced with that of listeriolysin O. This pore-forming protein, originating from Listeria monocytogenes [5], allows the escape of antigens into the cytosol and thereby enhances the T-cell immune response through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway in addition to the MHC class II. Preliminary data suggest that the rBCG VPM1002 may be more immunogenic and may be safer than BCG. This is why two large studies using this rBCG are underway against COVID-19, one in Germany (Study to Assess VPM1002 in Reducing Hospital Admissions and/or Severe Respiratory Infectious Diseases in Elderly in COVID-19 Pandemic, NCT04435379) and the other in Canada named COBRA (Principal Investigator A. Zlotta; Efficacy and Safety of VPM1002 in Reducing SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19] Infection Rate and Severity, NCT04439045). Finally, the rBCG VPM1002 is currently also studied as intravesical therapy in NMIBC, in particular when BCG has previously failed [6] and the publication of Phase II data is expected in the near future. The use of BCG in the prophylaxis or treatment of COVID-19 outside of controlled clinical trials is, of course, not recommended. Dr Alexandre Zlotta, is the Principal Investigator of ‘Efficacy and Safety of VPM1002 in Reducing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Infection Rate and Severity, NCT04439045’ one of the trials mentioned in the submitted work. Dr Alexandre Zlotta, is a consultant for Verity Pharmaceuticals, the Canadian importer of VPM1002.},

	abstract = {Background: Epidemiological studies show that BCG vaccinated population seems to be more likely protected from COVID-19 infection, but WHO gave a stark warning on use of BCG vaccine without confirmed COVID-19 trials. The aim of this survey is to assess the ability and readiness to respond to viral infection by physicians who had been BCG vaccinated. Methods: After Ethical Committee authorization, professional orders were used to contact physicians with an online survey. Specialty, COVID-19 infection, and previous BCG vaccination were recorded. Statistical data analysis was performed. Results: 1906 medicals answered the questionnaire, (M=1068; F=838; mean age 50.7+/-13.3; >24<87 yrs), more than half (1062; 55.72 %) experienced BCG vaccination. Professional activity was recorded, and only 49 subjects (2.57%) of them was infected by SARS-CoV2. Among the group of infected people, asymptomatic form occurred in 12 subjects (24.5%); a pauci-symptomatic form in 24 subjects (49.0%); a severe form (pneumonia and/or respiratory distress) in 13 (26.5%). SARS-CoV2 infection rate was 2.17% (23/1062) in vaccinated group and 1.66 % (14/844) in unvaccinated group (p=0.359). Conclusion: Our experience does not confirm the possible protective role of BCG against COVID-19, pending ongoing controlled trials. Although recent epidemiological studies point out in BCG vaccinated population a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV2 infection, in our cohort of physicians no significant difference was found in terms of prevalence of COVID-19 infection. Our data underline the necessity to follow the WHO warning about indiscriminate use of BCG vaccine, until clear evidence of protection by BCG vaccination against COVID-19 is fully demonstrated.},

	abstract = {<sec> <title>UNSTRUCTURED</title> BACKGROUND The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world. Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. METHODS Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. RESULTS Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials. </sec> <sec> <title>INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT</title> RR2-https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.14.20131268 </sec>},

	abstract = {Abstract Context: Lower morbidity and mortality in few geographic locations on the globe suffering with SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with the existing or previously followed long standing BCG vaccination policy amongst infants. But does that hold true that today after years of BCG vaccination few adults have better prognosis or is it just confounding due to differential disease burden, population density, testing facilities or improper reporting. The purpose was to evaluate and correlate this effect systematically. Evidence acquisition: Detailed electronic search for randomised controlled trials and observational studies in PubMed, Cochrane database and clinicaltrials.gov for eligible studies was performed. We performed a meta-analysis to provide pooled esimate of correlation of mortality with BCG vaccination policy from 4 studies. Results: 114 number of studies were yielded on search strategy and 28 observational studies were finally included for analysis . From our results we can say that BCG vaccination causes a decrease in COVID-19 incidence and mortality. But these results must be interpreted cautiously as lot of confounding factors were present in included studies, which can affect the outcome. Conclusion: The evidence of BCG vaccination for protection against COVID-19 can’t be ruled out as evidence from many studies support the hypothesis but the evidence of well conducted RCTs and observational studies can strengthen the evidence.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major risk factors for COVID-19 complications as it is one of the chronic immune-compromising conditions especially if patients have uncontrolled diabetes, poor HbA1c \&amp;amp;/or irregular blood glucose levels. Diabetic patient\&amp;rsquo;s mortality rates with COVID-19 are higher than cardiovascular or cancer patients. Recently Bacillus Calmette\&amp;ndash;Gu\&amp;eacute;rin (BCG) has shown successful results in reversing diabetes in both rats and clinical trials based on different mechanisms from aerobic glycolysis to Beta cells regeneration. BCG is a multi-face vaccine that has been used extensively in protection from TB and leprosy and has been repositioned for treatment of bladder cancer, diabetes \&amp;amp; multiple sclerosis. Recently, the COVID-19 epidemiological study confirmed that universal BCG vaccination reduced morbidity and mortality in certain geographical areas. Countries without universal policies of BCG vaccination (Italy, Nederland, USA) have been more severely affected compared to countries with universal and long-standing BCG policies that have shown low numbers of reported COVID-19 cases. Some countries have started clinical trials that included a single dose BCG vaccine as prophylaxis from COVID-19 or an attempt to minimize its side effects. This proposed research aims to use BCG vaccine as a double-edged weapon countering both COVID-19 \&amp;amp; diabetes, not only as protection but also as therapeutic vaccination. The work includes a case study of regenerated pancreatic beta cells based on improved C-peptide \&amp;amp; PCPRI laboratory findings after BCG vaccination for a 9 years\&amp;rsquo; patient. The patient was re-vaccinated based on a negative tuberculin test \&amp;amp; no scar at the site of injection of the 1st BCG vaccination at birth. Furthermore, the authors in the present article described a prospective BCG multi-dose clinical study in full details that they will apply in case of acceptance of their submitted grant \&amp;amp; the ethical committee approval. The aim of the clinical study is to check if double dose BCG (4 weeks apart) will show a significant difference in the protection of health care professionals in Egypt. The authors suggest and invite the scientific community to take into consideration the concept of direct BCG re-vaccination (after 4 weeks) because of the reported gene expressions \&amp;amp; exaggerated innate immunity consequently. As the diabetic MODY-5 patient (mutation of HNF1B, Val2Leu) was on low dose Riomet\&amp;reg; while eliminating insulin gradually, a simple analytical method for metformin assay was recommended to ensure its concentration before use as it is not approved yet by the Egyptian QC labs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background : Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) is a viral pandemic disease that induces severe pneumonia in human. Until now, no effective therapeutic interventions or specific vaccines have been developed. In this paper, we attempt to investigate the putative implication of 12 vaccines, including BCG, OPV and MMR in the protection against COVID-19. First, we compared sequences of the main antigenic proteins in the investigated vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Then, we investigated identified segments using a combination of structural and antigenicity prediction tools to predict their immunogenic effect. Results : A total of 14 highly similar segments were identified in investigated vaccines. After mapping on S and N proteins and analysis of the antigenicity prediction, three segments, in Hepatitis B, Tetanus and Measles proteins showed structural and antigenic properties that can induce possible putative protective effect. Conclusions : HBV, Tetanus and Measles vaccines should constitute a good candidate for a clinical trial to evaluate their real protective effect against COVID-19.},

	abstract = {The “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)” outbreak was first reported in December 2019 (China). Since then, this disease has rapidly spread across the globe and in March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.1 Since the outbreak was first announced, our journal has extensively focused on the clinical features, outcomes, diagnosis, immunology, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 and its infectious agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We published our first COVID-19 article on 19 February, focusing for the first time on the clinical characteristics of 140 cases of human-to-human coronavirus transmission without any links to the Huanan Wet Market.2 Hypertension and diabetes were mentioned as risk factors and there was no increased prevalence in allergic patients. This early study reported that the main symptoms at hospital admission were fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%), and dyspnea (36.7%). Lymphopenia and eosinopenia were also reported as important signs and biomarkers for monitoring and severity of the patients.2 The prevalent eosinopenia in COVID-19 patients and the possible anti-viral role of eosinophils were further discussed in several following publications inAllergy .3,4 Our second COVID-19 paper brought attention to the wide range of clinical manifestations of this disease, from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia as well as with only diarrhea.5Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were severe. Another article, timely appearing in our journal, alerted the scientific community that even in experienced hands there was a 14.1% false negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnosis in COVID-19 cases and were later diagnosed positive after repeated tests.6 A pediatric article was also published extensively analyzing 182 cases and it was reported that children with COVID-19 showed a mild clinical course.7 Patients with pneumonia had a higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers compared to those without pneumonia. There were 43 allergic patients in this series and there was no significant difference between allergic and non-allergic COVID-19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory, and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for disease and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not significantly influence the disease course of COVID-19 in children.7The immunology of COVID-19 was extensively reviewed in two articles from leading experts with a comprehensive discussion of the tip of the iceberg in COVID-19 epidemiology, anti-viral response, antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, acute phase reactants, cytokine storm, and pathogenesis of tissue injury and severity. 8,9Two studies timely reported the role of possible trained immunity in countries with a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination programme and a relatively low COVID-19 prevalence and mortality rate.10,11 In an extensive RNA sequencing analyses of SARS-CoV-2 receptor and their molecular partners revealed that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells.12Allergists, respiratory physicians, pediatricians, and other health care providers treating patients with allergic diseases are frequently in contact with patients potentially infected with SARS-CoV-2. Practical considerations and recommendations given by experts in the field of allergic diseases can provide useful recommendations for clinical daily work. Since the beginning of this current pandemic, our journal has disseminated clinical reports, 2,3,5,6,13 statements on the urgent need for accuracy in designing and reporting clinical trials in COVID-19,14 preventive measures,10,11,15 and Position Statements elaborated by experts in the field in close collaboration with the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and its task force “Allergy and Its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) ”.16-28 (keynote information in table 1). A compendium answering 150 frequently encountered questions regarding COVID-19 and allergic diseases has been recently published by experts in their respective area.29 In addition, readers can put further questions regarding this “living ” compendium electronically to the authors and their answers will be available through a new category in the journal’s webpage.30Besides, EAACI in collaboration with ARIA, has provided recommendations on operational plans and practical procedures for ensuring optimal standards in the daily clinical care of patients with allergic diseases, whilst ensuring the safety of patients and healthcare workers.23Table 1: Examples of recently published recommendations, statements and Position Papers of the EAACI},

	abstract = {Main text:“Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.”~ Tao-Te-Ching (Book of the Way) by Lao-Tzu, 350 B.C.ESince its first report in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the novel pandemic COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2 virus), has rampaged throughout the world. Approximately 80% of the COVID-19 patients manifest with only mild upper respiratory symptoms, 10-15% develop bilateral infiltrated pneumonia, and 5 to 10% of the severe cases progress to develop Acute Respiratory Disease Syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organs failure by the ‘cytokine releasing storm’ (CRS).1 Older age, male gender, chronic cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are among the risk factors associated with severe COVID-19.2 Asthmatics are known to be more frequently infected and at a greater risk of developing more severe outcomes with respiratory/common cold viral infections, particularly in those with poorly controlled asthma.3Moreover, there is a deficiency and delay of the production of type I and type III interferons in the lung cells of asthmatic patients, potentially more favorable for SARS-CoV2 infection that depends on a hampered innate anti-virus immune response in the respiratory tract.3 However, recent reports have accumulated evidences that the prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma in patients with COVID-19 is lower than expected and underrepresented among other comorbidities and risk factors of the severe form of COVID-19.4-6 Li et al.5 reported that the prevalence of asthma in patients with severe COVID-19 (n= 269, 49.1% of total 548 patients) was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of Wuhan. Moreover, none of the children (below 12 years of age) infected with SARS-CoV2 at the Wuhan Children’s Hospital had underlying asthma.6 These findings on the low prevalence of asthma may be confounded by a sampling bias (all hospitalized patients) in the reported cases, underdiagnoses, or lack of recognition of asthma in those with COVID-19. In fact, lack of surveys of the confirmed COVID-19 cases in the general population is a major limiting factor in answering the question whether chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, are key risk factors of SARS-CoV2 infection.4However, the interesting question to ask is why asthmatic patients did not have an increased exacerbation of asthma or became more prone to the severe form of COVID-19 after being infected with SARS-CoV2? We, therefore, propose the following plausible mechanisms in asthmatic patients that may have effects in the determination of the susceptibility and severity regarding SARS-CoV2 infection. Firstly, coronavirus recognition and infection is dependent on the cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for ducking spike protein of SARS-Cov2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to cleave the ducked spike protein for virus entry by membrane fusion.7 Lung cells that co-express these two molecules include nasal goblet secretory cells, bronchial transient secretory cells, and alveolar type II pneumocytes.8The gene expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are influenced by the genetic variants of the host, microbial infections, and induced by innate immune response, such as the production of interferons and mucins.8 It has been found that SARS-COv2 virus can hijack and enhance this innate anti-virus defense interferon production to induce ACE2, a human interferon stimulated gene (ISG), expression in the other uninfected cells, and promote its potential transmission and spread.8 While in asthma patients, the expression of these two molecules in the respiratory epithelial cells for SARS-CoV2 infection are determined by the age, gender, comorbidity and type 2 allergic inflammation. Jackson et al. found asthma and respiratory allergy are associated with reduced ACE2 expression in airway cells based on their patient cohorts.9 Moreover, ACE2 expression in the lower airway epithelium was lower in the post–allergen challenge samples, and its levels of expression was also significantly inversely associated with type 2 immune inflammation biomarkers. 9 In contrast, in an analysis of the nasal airway epithelial transcriptome in 695 children, Sajuthi et al.10 demonstrated that TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 allergic inflammation mainly by interleukin-13. Peters et al.11 from the same group, found the gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the cells obtained from induced sputum did not differ between healthy and asthmatics. Instead, a higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthmatic subgroups for poor COVID19 outcomes.11 Therefore, these reports did not describe convincing information as to whether the asthmatic patients had a lower expression of ACE2 and serine protease TMPRSS2 for SARS-CoV2 based on their allergic status and/or chronic lung inflammation. Particularly, these studies lacked information on the effect of SARS- CoV-2- specific analysis and observations in asthmatic patients to be able to reach a conclusion in the real world.Secondly, viral load and immune response of the host determines the final outcome and/or the severity of ARDS and multiple organ failures in COVID-19 patients. At the initial phase, antivirus innate immune response determine the clearance of virus by the production of Type I/III interferons of infected cells. Lack of or lowered production of IFNα2 and IFNλ, and high viral loads are frequently found in the severe cases that deteriorated into needing ICU care.12 At the second phase of COVID-19 infection, aberrant host immune response by infected macrophages that lead to cytokines releasing storm, and T lymphocytes depletion due to the prolonged viral infection are the two major determining factors for a final clinical outcome.12 For asthmatic patients, the innate immune response to COVID-19 infection may be impaired due to lower levels of IFNγ in their bronchial epithelial cells, but it may also turn into favor for reducing ACE2 expression, which is depended on IFNγ production.8 In addition to IFNs, there are other molecules of innate immunity in the respiratory tract that may also have anti-viral functions, such as mannose binding lectin (MBL), and surfactant protein A (SP-A) and D (SP-D) that are produced by alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, which are also the largely infected by SARS coronavirus. These molecules, MBL and SP-D, found in higher concentrations in the Broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (BALF) of patients with asthma and respiratory allergy and are increased due to chronic inflammation, have been identified to bind spike protein of SARS coronavirus, and inhibit its binding to ACE2 cellular receptor, and thereby able to protect the alveolar macrophages from virus-induced activation.13, 14Recently, it is found that long-term boosting of the innate immune responses, also termed ‘trained immunity’, by prior microbial infection or certain live vaccines, induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells.15 Experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infections. For example, gamma herpes virus infection can protect against an allergic response in experimental asthma,16 while adenovirus infection-induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently induced more pronounced anti-bacterial immunity.17This trained immunity in the myeloid cells and alveolar macrophages of asthmatics may provide anti-viral immunity in specific organs such as the lungs. Although this hypothesis has not been validated in patients with COVID-19, clinical trials to booster trained innate immunity by BCG vaccination to protect against COVID-19 have been initiated in several countries.18Finally, we highlight that therapeutic medications and biologics used for asthma control may have some beneficial pharmacological effects in COVID-19 infections. From in-vitro models, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators have been shown to suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production.19 Asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) demonstrated lower expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their bronchial epithelial cells.11 There is a clinical report of the improvement in three COVID-19 patients after using inhaled ciclesonide, although this study did not have proper controls.20 Before the outbreak of COVID-19, clinical observation in children with severe asthma who received anti-IgE monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) have shown decreased duration of human rhinovirus (HRV) infections, viral shedding, and risk of HRV-related illnesses compared with guideline-driven care alone.21In vitro, omalizumab attenuated plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) FcεRIα protein expression while simultaneously augmenting pDC IFN-α responses to HRV and influenza virus.22 Together, these findings provide direct evidence that blocking IgE decreases susceptibility to respiratory viral illnesses through enhanced IFN-α responses in pDCs. Whether this anti-virus effect by anti-IgE treatment also includes infection with coronavirus and SARS-CoV2 is an open question that remains to be verified. More interestingly, azithromycin combined with hydroxychloroquine in an open-label non-randomized clinical trial for COVID-19 patients, has significant decreased the viral load after six days of treatment compared to untreated controls.23Azithromycin has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbation and improve the quality of life of asthmatic adults and preschool children with asthma that was not adequately controlled on standard inhaler therapy.24 Although the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory effect in asthma is still not well defined, some studies presented a reduction of IL-6 levels after azithromycin treatment.25 Moreover, a relevant study from Gielen and co-workers demonstrated that azithromycin augments IFN-β and IFN-λ production and decreasing rhinovirus replication and release from rhinovirus-infected human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.26 Hence, it is suggested that azithromycin may have protective effects in reducing SARS-CoV-2 invasion by interfering with ligand/CD147 receptor interactions, a novel SARS-CoV2 cellular receptors beside ACE2, and decreasing the expression of some metalloproteinase (downstream to CD147) in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus.27 However, controlled clinical trials using azithromycin to treat patients with COVID-19 (not involving asthmatic subjects) are now registered in several countries with results still pending.In summary, we have seen a new zoonotic coronavirus, SARS-CoV2, infection that has had a devastating effect on the host immunity via the inhibition of interferons leading to aberrant innate immune response, macrophages inflammation in cytokine releasing storm, and exhaustion of the cellular immunity of T lymphocytes.28 In contrast, due to chronic and sustained type 2 immune inflammation in the lungs of asthmatic patients, or fortunately by the medications they use for asthma control, it seems asthma may not be a major confounding disease in COVID-19 infection, and this unexpected phenomenon may throw a new light in finding therapies or preventative strategies for SARS-CoV2 (Figure 1 ). We still need a more comprehensive and in-depth immune analysis of SARS-CoV2 infection in the coming days to explore this hypothesis. However, all standard asthma therapies, whether inhaled steroids, combination of inhaled steroid plus long acting bronchodilator therapies, or monoclonal antibodies like omalizumab and azithromycin, should be continued to be used to optimize asthma control as recommended by all medical societies, for they can not only substantially reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation, but also will reduce risks and severe outcomes of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Background: Trials of BCG to prevent COVID-19 are taking place in adults, some of whom have been previously vaccinated, but evidence of BCG’s beneficial non-specific effects come largely from data on mortality in infants, and from in vitro and animal studies. We assess all-cause mortality following a large BCG re-vaccination trial in Malawi.  Methods: A population-based double-blind randomised trial comparing BCG re-vaccination vs placebo to prevent tuberculosis and leprosy was initiated in Karonga District, Malawi, in 1986-9, in individuals aged 3 months to 75 years. Active follow-up was carried out in northern areas of the district in 1991-94 and in a southern area in 2002-2018 covering 15.8% (7389 individuals) and 12.0% (5616 individuals) of the trial population respectively. Year of death or leaving the area were recorded for those not found. We used survival analysis to estimate all-cause mortality rates. Findings: There was no difference in mortality rate between the BCG and placebo group in either follow-up, overall or by age group. Mortality rates in the northern areas were 6.6/1000 person years at risk (pyar), 95% confidence interval 5.5-7.8, and 7.0/1000pyar (5.9-8.2) for those who received BCG and placebo, respectively. In the southern area they were 6.3/1000 pyar, (5.5-7.1), and 5.9/1000 pyar, (5.2-6.8), respectively.  Interpretation: We found no evidence of any beneficial effect of BCG re-vaccination on all-cause mortality. The high proportion of deaths attributable to non-infectious causes beyond infancy, and the long time interval since BCG for most deaths, may obscure any benefits.  Funding Statement: The original trial was funded by primarily by the British Leprosy Relief Association (LEPRA), with assistance from the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Organizations (ILEP), and the Immunology of Leprosy component of the UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (IMMLEP/TDR), with support of the Malawian Ministry of Health. The later follow-up was funded by The Wellcome Trust There was no specific funding for this analysis. Declaration of Interests: We declare no competing interests. Ethics Approval Statement: The trial protocol was approved in 1985 by the Health Sciences Research Committee of the Malawi Ministry of Health, the Standing Committee on Research in Human Subjects of WHO, and the Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine. Follow-up of the population has been approved in the context of other studies by the Health Sciences Research Committee of the Malawi Ministry of Health and the Ethics Committee of the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine.},

Multiple clinical trials are currently underway to assess effectiveness of the vaccine in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the durability and mechanism of BCG trained immunity remain unclear. Here, an integrative analysis of available epidemiological transcriptomic data related to BCG vaccination and respiratory tract viral infections, and transcriptomic alterations reported in COVID-19 is presented toward addressing this gap. Results suggest that the vaccine induces very long-lasting transcriptomic changes that, unsurprisingly, mimic viral infections by upregulated antiviral defense response, and, counterintuitively. oppose viral infections by downregulated myeloid cell activation. These durability and mechanistic insights have immediate implications in fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background: Since 1 October 2019, COVID-19 has resulted in nearly 18 million reported cases and 700,000 deaths worldwide. The hypothesis that the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine may offer protection against COVID-19 has motivated clinical trials in Australia, the Netherlands and other countries. The results of these trials will not be known for months. Methods: We use a regression discontinuity differences-in-differences (RD-DD) design in Germany exploiting differential BCG vaccination practices in the East and in the West during 1945-90. Our analysis compares cases per capita in German counties within 100 km of the former border for cohorts born around 1990, when mandatory vaccination ended in the East and the West continued to not recommended BCG vaccination.  Findings: We analyzed 154,175 COVID-19  cases by single ages reported in 400 counties in Germany on April 24, 2020. We find that cohorts born shortly before and after the policy change exhibit no significant differences in COVID-19 prevalence to those in the west. Eastern counties report fewer log cases per capita than counties just in the west (estimate -.830, 95% CI: -0.528 to -1.132). However, this difference is larger for cohorts born ten years after the policy change (estimate -1.190, 95% CI:  -2.384 to 0.003) than those born ten years prior (estimate -0.595, 95% CI:  -0.995 to -0.195). A spatial SIR model with commuter flows between German counties  produces a differential of -0.588 (95% CI: -1.048 to -0.127) without reference to the BCG vaccine. Interpretation: We interpret our results as providing evidence against the BCG hypothesis. Instead, our evidence is consistent with discontinuities in commuter flows across the former East Germany border being an important contributor to the discontinuity in COVID-19 cases.

Prevention being the mainstay many theories started evolving among which one was BCG vaccination having a protective influence on COVID. Few systematic reviews and other studies were conducted on it. However,there is dearth of literature on such issue. Hence narrative review with compilation of 2 systematic reviews, 2 meta-analysis and 8 observational studies was done. Many trials are still ongoing. The present review concluded that BCG lowered neonatal sepsis and elderly morbidity due to pneumonia.

	abstract = {To the Editor: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARC-CoV-2) has led to an imminent need for an effective vaccination to constrain viral spread and reduce global disease morbidity and mortality. BCG, a live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis, was demonstrated to have a non-specific immunomodulatory effects, by training the innate immune system to generate memory, which aided the host in fighting a wide range of viral infections in subsequent years.1 BCG was reported to reduce viremia, respiratory tract infections, and neonatal mortality,1 but it was not tested effectively in a recent, large randomized trial.2 Several ecological studies reported that BCG vaccinations could have a beneficial effects against COVID-19;3-5 they also suggested that different BCG strains might vary in their protective ability.6 In contrast, one study in Israel found no difference in the SARS-CoV-2-positive rate between individuals born during the period of mandatory BCG vaccinations and those born outside that period.7 All these studies analyzed aggregated data at the population level without directly comparing individuals that did to those that did not receive BCG vaccinations. Meanwhile, even if BCG vaccination is found to be effective in reducing COVID-19 incidence and mortality, it remains unclear whether the protective effect might change with time (age) or different BCG strains, or whether protection might be increased with a booster. In this study, we described the clinical syndrome in confirmed COVID-19 cases and their BCG vaccination history. We aimed to elucidate the potential protective association between a neonatal BCG vaccination and the clinical severity of COVID-19.In the 1950s, the BCG vaccination policy in Taiwan mainly targeted school children with negative tuberculin skin test (TST) results. In 1965, a nationwide neonatal BCG vaccination program was started. Initially, neonates were vaccinated with the Pasteur-1173 P2 strain, but in 1979, vaccinations shifted to the less reactogenic, Tokyo-172 strain. In 1965–1997, booster BCG vaccinations were given to 12 year-old adolescents with negative TSTs. The BCG vaccine coverage rate increased to 87% in 1975,8 and it has remained at 95.7%–98.8% since 1996.For the present study, records of BCG vaccinations in COVID-19 cases were obtained from the web-based National Immunization Information System (NIIS), established by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) in 2013. Eletronic vaccine records were compiled for individuals born as early as the 1980s. However, individual BCG vaccination records were unavailable in NIIS for individuals born in 1965-1985, and some were incomplete for those born in 1986-1995. The Taiwan CDC surveyed the NIIS database and found that the completeness of public-funded childhood immunization electronic records was above 90% for individuals born after 1996.Through the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System in Taiwan, COVID-19 was confirmed in 416 Taiwanese patients (median age: 36.3 years; mean: 40.2 years, range: 4-88 years; with 212 [51.0%] females) between Jan 21 and May 5, 2020. The diagnoses were based on positive SARC-CoV-2 RNA identification in real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCRs). Among the 416 patients with COVID-19, 366 (88.0%) had imported the disease from other regions. These patients reported travel to the following regions within 14 days of disease onset: 184 (50.3%) to European regions, 91 (24.9%) to American regions, 26 (7.1%) to Western Pacific regions, 11 (3.0%) to Eastern Mediterranean regions, 9 (2.5%) to South-East Asia regions, 4 (1.1%) to African regions, and 41 (11.2%) to at least two of the regions mentioned.The highest rate of COVID-19 cases occurred among individuals aged 18–24 years (56.3 per million), followed by individuals aged 25–33 years (38.1 per million), and individuals aged 34–41 (14.4 per million). According to the clinical syndrome associated with COVID-19, defined by the World Health Organization,9 the clinical severity of these COVID-19 cases varied by age (Table 1 ). Approximately 80% of individuals aged 18–41 years with COVID-19 experienced a mild illness (including asymptomatic infections). In contrast, among individuals aged 42–54 and ≥ 55 years, 43.1% and 38.9%, respectively, had a mild illness, up to 2% and 16%, respectively, had severe pneumonia, and 10% in both age groups had acute respiratory syndrome. Among 9 children (<18 years) with COVID-19, three had pneumonia.We examined the relationship between COVID-19 severity and BCG vaccination status among individuals aged 4–24 and individuals aged 25–33 years with electronic vaccination records (Table 2 ). In the 4–24 age group, among individuals that received neonatal BCG vaccinations, 15.4% had pneumonia and 2.4% had severe pneumonia. In contrast, all three individuals in this age group that did not receive neonatal BCG vaccinations experienced mild illness. In the 25–33 age group, pneumonia or severe pneumonia occurred in a lower proportion of those with neonatal BCG vaccination records, compared to the group without neonatal BCG vaccination records (6.1% vs. 18.4%). However, these data should be interpreted cautiously, because the numbers of cases in the vaccinated and unvaccinated groups were small, some vaccination records in childhood were incomplete, and host genetic factors and SARS-CoV-2 virulence factors might have had a substantial influence on the COVID‑19 outcome. In conclusion, our data suggested that, compared to individuals that did not have BCG vaccination records at birth, young adults aged 25-33 years that received the Tokyo-172 BCG vaccination at birth appeared to experience lower COVID-19 severity. However, this finding must be confirmed in future randomized controlled trials.},

	abstract = {Bats, thought to be the ancestral hosts of coronaviruses that cause disease in people, do not themselves become ill when infected, and nobody knows why. Findings from an in-vitro study show that the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus persists in bat cells thanks to a delicate immunological interplay between cell and virus. Bat cells seem able to upregulate type I interferon, which suppresses viral replication to avoids the cell death seen in infected human cells. The virus also adapts by rapidly mutating a specific gene in the viral open reading frame 5. The researchers posit that stress—for instance, from habitat loss or wet markets—can disturb this regulatory balance and cause spill-over into other species. An analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genomes from more that 7500 isolates collected around the word has identified almost 200 mutations in the virus that have happened independently and on multiple occasions. These recurrent mutations might suggest ongoing adaptation to human hosts. Other areas of the genome have stayed stable, suggesting the potential of targets for treatments or vaccines. A phylogenetic analysis shows that, in the worst-hit countries, genetic diversity is similar to the global level, indicating that the virus has entered these countries on multiple occasions, rather than through just one index case. A rapid antigen test has shown promise in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal samples from 328 people with suspected infections. The COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip (Coris BioConcept; Gembloux, Belgium), which gives results in 15 minutes, had a sensitivity to correctly identify positive results of 57·6%, and had near perfect specificity, correctly identifying negative samples with an accuracy of 99·5%. The immunochromatographic test detects the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, and because it is cheaper and less technically demanding than RT-PCR, researchers believe it could help limit the spread of the virus by quickly identifying suspected cases for quarantine, especially in resource-poor areas. Findings from an in-vitro study in monkey cells suggest that a team of European researchers have identified a human monoclonal antibody that blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. The team had previously worked on antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV from 2002/2003 and identified the antibody 47D11, which their most recent study shows can cross neutralize both viruses. The antibody does so by targeting a conserved region on the trimeric spike glycoprotein involved in cell entry. A treatment based on 47D11 might thus hold potential for future outbreaks of coronaviruses, but further work is needed to better understand how the antibody works. The fact that the antibody is fully human bodes well for speedy progress into human trials. Researchers have identified a microbe, Microsporidia MB, that protects Anopheles arabiensis mosquitoes from Plasmodium falciparum infection. The study, done near Lake Victoria in Kenya, found microsporidia infections in roughly 5% of sampled insects, none of which had Plasmodium infection. Further laboratory studies confirmed that the microsporidia gave complete protection from Plasmodium. It is still unclear how the microbe confers protection. It might prime the insects' immune system or interfere with metabolism in such a way that the parasites can't survive. Microsporidia MB infection does not determine any fitness cost for the mosquitoes, which makes it a promising candidate for use in biological malaria control. Widespread BCG vaccination within a few days of birth could save close to a million newborn lives a year, say researchers, but not from tuberculosis, the disease it was designed to vaccinate against. Findings from a 5-year cohort study in Guinea-Bissau and The Gambia show that BCG vaccination within 3 days of birth gives substantial protection from sepsis, the cause of three quarters of all deaths within the first week of life. The researchers confirmed the finding in a mouse model of neonatal polymicrobial sepsis, in which they detected a rapid and protective increase in neutrophils, or emergency granulopoiesis, a finding they later validated in blood samples from children from The Gambia and Guinea-Bissau. A team of researchers from Australia, China, the UK, and the USA, has proposed a process for harnessing multiple disease models to help give clearer recommendations to policy makers. The process has three main steps: each team is first set a specific scenario to model (eg, the lifting of social isolation measures for COVID-19), they then meet to discuss their models and, finally, refine each of their models on the basis of the learning from group discussions. While helping each team make more robust models, the process can also guide future research priorities by identifying the most important gaps in knowledge.},

Several observers and prominent news outlets have noticed that countries still administering an old vaccine against tuberculosis—the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine—have had fewer coronavirus cases and fewer deaths per capita in the early stages of the outbreak. But is that correlation really strong evidence that the BCG vaccine provides some defense against COVID-19? In this post, we look at the incidence of coronavirus cases along the former border between East and West Germany, using econometric techniques to investigate whether historical differences in vaccination policies account for the lower level of infection in the former East.},

Validation was performed using linear regression and country-specific modeling. CSM was lower for 80% of similarly clustered countries with a BCG vaccination policy for at least the preceding 15 years (BCG15). CSM increased significantly for each increase in the percent population over age 65. The total population of a country and BCG15 were significantly associated with improved CSM. There was a consistent association between countries with a BCG vaccination for the preceding 15 years, but not other vaccination programs, and CSM.},

	abstract = {The Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) tuberculosis vaccine has immunity benefits against respiratory infections. Accordingly, it has been hypothesized that it may have a protective effect against COVID-19. Recent research found that countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) childhood vaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead, this paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took place in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led to a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us to estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with cross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were recorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change, representing 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used regression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19 related outcomes. This method used on such a large population allows for a high precision that would be hard to achieve using a classical randomized controlled trial. The odds ratio for Covid-19 cases and Covid-19 related hospitalizations were 0.9997 (CI95: [0.8002-1.1992]) and 1.1931 (CI95: [0.7558-1.6304]), respectively. We can thus reject with 95\\% confidence that universal BCG vaccination reduces the number of cases by more than 20% and the number of hospitalizations by more than 24%.

	abstract = {Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 35 million confirmed cases and more than 1 million deaths so far. This has led to global efforts to find effective treatment and vaccination to control disease transmission and decrease severity. The current efforts are focused on developing a vaccine that is safe and effective after one or two doses, provides protection for a minimum of six months, provides protection for high-risk population and reduces the risk of onward viral transmission. In this review, we summarize available information related to the development and safety profile of these phase III vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Methods Literature search was performed on PubMed, Cochrane and ClinicalTrial.gov using keywords like “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, and “Phase III vaccines”. Two individuals performed screening of the resultant library. We assessed different articles for information focusing on vaccines in phase III trials. Results As of September 3, 2020 update by the World Health Organization (WHO), there are currently more than 137 candidate vaccines undergoing preclinical development and of these 34 candidate vaccines are in the clinical evaluation phase, 18 are in phase I and 5 are in phase II. Currently, there are 9 vaccines in the phase III development process. Conclusion Multiple phase III trials of COVID-19 vaccines are in progress across the globe, highlighting the collaborative international efforts to develop a safe and effective vaccine. The available efficacy and safety data of phase I/II trials of these vaccines have shown promising results. Pharmaceutical companies are using different strategies including inactivated vaccines, RNA vaccines, recombinant viral vector vaccines and live attenuated BCG vaccine.},

	abstract = {Background. As of the end of December 2019, the list of priority areas of research and development of WHO included coronavirus of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, coronavirus of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). In January, a new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was added to this list. The COVID-19 pandemic puts enormous pressure on the health systems of all countries, including those with a high TB burden, including Ukraine.\&#x0D; Objective. To describe the condition of TB care in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze the prospects for the consequences of the interaction between COVID-19 and TB.\&#x0D; Materials and methods. Analysis of literature and statistics on this issue.\&#x0D; Results and discussion. As a result of social distancing and staying at home, it is difficult to provide quality TB care: the level of timely diagnosis decreases, treatment control deteriorates, the number of undetected side effects in outpatients increases, the proportion of patients with uncontrolled or interrupted TB treatment increases. These processes can have serious adverse consequences. A comparison of TB incidence, including relapses, found out that in Ukraine in the first half of 2020 the TB incidence decreased by 27.4 % compared to the same period in 2019. Unfortunately, this most likely does not indicate a true decrease in incidence, but the reduction of the TB detection due to quarantine measures. The largest difference between 2019 and 2020 is observed in Zhytomyr, Ivano-Frankivsk, Rivne, Ternopil and Chernivtsi regions, which roughly corresponds to the distribution map of COVID-19. The incidence of TB in combination with HIV/AIDS in 2020 is also lower than in 2019 (by 28.4 %). Advanced cases have started to be registered more and more often, and in the conditions of strict quarantine patients with active bacterial excretion pose a serious threat to contact persons, first of all, to risk groups for COVID-19. Coronavirus infection can accelerate the activation of latent TB. According to the WHO, latent TB affects a quarter of the world’s population, so if the activation is accelerated, the process can easily get out of control. All viral infections, including COVID-19, also have an immunosuppressive effect that promotes TB progression. In case of co-existence, COVID-19 and TB have a mutually reinforcing effect, which reduces the likelihood of favourable outcomes for the patient. The interruption of TB treatment on the background of COVID-19 is an additional danger. Patients with TB, COVID-19 and diabetes are the most difficult to treat. In a pandemic, the feasibility of using intravenous forms of anti-TB drugs, which can intensify treatment, dramatically increases. On the positive side, the response of the medical community to COVID-19 can help the long-term efforts to combat TB through infection prevention and control, the development of a contact control system, surveillance and monitoring. The WHO recommends continuing to vaccinate newborns with the BCG vaccine. Clinical trials of the BCG vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus infection are currently underway.\&#x0D; Conclusions. 1. The detection of TB in Ukraine in 2020 compared to 2019 decreased by 27.4 %, in children – by 34.5 %. 2. Coronavirus infection accelerates the activation of latent TB, has an immunosuppressive effect, promotes the progression of TB. 3. To improve TB treatment during a pandemic, electronic monitoring of drug circulation and treatment outcomes should be actively introduced. 4. TB treatment in people with and without coronavirus infection does not have any differences. 5. In a pandemic, the feasibility of using intravenous forms of anti-TB drugs is growing.},

To the Editor: As we enter the 4th month of the COVID-19 pandemic it is imperative to assess our models of preventive care. Protocols for prevention and engineering controls may benefit re-opening our economy. HIV is the benchmark viral disease where preventive protocols including personal protective equipment (PPE), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) mitigated transmission without vaccination. The COVID-19 pandemic should borrow from this and develop PrEP and PEP algorithms to ameliorate risk. As of the week of May 10th, clinicalgtrials.gov listed only 51 trials out of 693 recruiting trials (7.3%) that were investigating conversion rates and pre-exposure/post-exposure prophylaxis. Studies are evaluating BCG vaccination, chlorine dioxide rinses, saline/povidine/iodine/chlorhexidine nasal rinses, Lactobacillus Coryniformis K8, honey/nigella sativa/black cumin, azithromycin, emtricitabine/tenofovir, lopinavir/ritonavir, recombinant Alpha-1 b interferon/thymosin alpha 1 drops, vitamin C, zinc, quercetin, and hydroxychloroquine. Only 15 of these 51 trials are based in the USA. Given that every jurisdiction has at risk public workers all locales should be involved in PrEP/PEP clinical trials. Additional treatments to consider are low dose chlorine/saline rinses-drinking water contains 1 ppm chlorine, pools 2 to 4 ppm1; quinine containing tonic water beverages (Gin tonic developed as prophylaxis against malaria)2 and supplementation with vitamin D as mortality has been noted to be lower in individuals with higher vitamin D levels.3 These and others interventions with pharmacologic (not supra-pharmacologic4) dosing could modify the severity of COVID-19. Analysis with Poisson distribution could be implemented to assess statistical benefit. The conversion rate from observational studies would serve as the average number of events per interval. Engineering controls in transportation and public spaces such as high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration may mollify air quality issues. Topical long acting disinfectants5 for hard and soft surfaces may be adaptable for use in auditoriums, and classrooms. Expanding our horizons with regard to PrEP, PEP and engineering controls may abate the severity of COVID-19 and allow for safe and sustainable return to relative normality.},

Teleworking has become the ultimate way of service continuity. The planning was revised according to health priorities. Work procedures were set online. A minimum list of medicines known as "medicines of health and strategic interest" was established. The Directorate of Pharmacy and Medicines (DPM) has been working on updating medicines stock data. A provisional suspension of authorizations for medicines export for 1 mo was decided. A fast-track procedure allowing the validation of alternative sources of raw materials has been put in place. An appeal for a fast track manufacture of hydroalcoholic gel/solutions was launched. A Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered and Investigational Interventions (MEURI) procedure has been adopted in order to dispense off-label prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination. Focus groups were organized in order to set up therapeutic trials exploring possible strategies of COVID-19 treatment, such as serotherapy and BCG vaccine. This proactive and anticipatory policy has made it possible to meet the health challenges dictated by this crisis.},

Although vaccine research and development technology has made great progress, the possibility of obtaining a safe and effective vaccine that can control the global epidemic in a short period of time is still low due to the antibody-dependent enhancement effect (ADE) of the vaccine and the mutation of the virus. In the absence of specific treatment for COVID-19, finding other alternative protection schemes has become another treatment idea. Epidemiological studies have found that, in this COVID-19 epidemic, countries with long-term Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination policies have relatively less cases and lower mortality rates than countries without relevant policies. This phenomenon may be related to the training immunity effect of BCG. In order to further clarify the preventive and protective effects of BCG vaccine on SARS-CoV-2 infection, a number of clinical trials are underway.},

	abstract = {Dear Editor,We read the article on possible effects of BCG vaccination policy on COVID-19 spread by Ozdemir et al. with interest and found it very thoughtful.1 In early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the countries without universal vaccination policies (Italy, United States) were more severely affected as compared to those with universal vaccination policies (India, Brazil).2 Based on these epidemiological observations it was hypothesized that the non-specific effects of BCG vaccine might be protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection and many randomized trials are testing it.2-4 However, we have a few concerns over these epidemiological associations.Firstly, most authors including Ozdemir et al divided the countries into two groups according to the presence or absence of “recent routine childhood BCG vaccination policy”. The countries having universal BCG coverage above 90% previously and stopped routine vaccination practice in the last one or two decades only (Czechia, Finland, France, Ireland, Norway, Slovakia, United Kingdom) were classified into the countries with “no BCG-vaccination policy”. On the contrary, some of the countries with routine BCG vaccination policy but poor coverage (Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan) were included in the category of countries following “routine BCG-vaccination policy”. Do the authors mean to confer that the protection offered by BCG (by its non-specific effects on immunity) is sustained for one to two decades only, and the actual immunization coverage of a country does not play a role? In that scenario, BCG vaccination shall be protective for children only (the least-affected age-group with COVID-19), whereas the adults and geriatric population (most-affected) will not be benefitted by it. Such classification (according to recent BCG vaccination status) completely ignores the previous vaccination status, actual BCG-vaccination coverage, and generalizes the results across all age-groups and leads to false conclusions. Therefore, an age-specific comparison of COVID-19 and BCG immunization coverage might be more meaningful.5Secondly, the authors did not adjust for any confounding factors like the number of tests done at that time, population demographics, co-morbidities, health infrastructure, reporting bias, etc. that can significantly alter the results.3 A recent study observed a positive correlation (opposite to what we think) between the COVID-19 related parameters (cases, death-rate, and case-fatality rate) and BCG vaccination coverage of various countries across the span of four decades. However, with adjustment of confounders, there was no correlation between COVID-19 and BCG coverage.6Thirdly, at the time of analysis (April 16, 2020) the pandemic was limited to the northern hemisphere which now has rapidly evolved. For now, four (India, Brazil, Russia, Peru) out of the five most affected countries have routine BCG vaccination policy with more than 90% coverage.5,6 Therefore, the analysis favouring BCG vaccination in the initial stages of the pandemic was too early to predict and was affected by the limited spread of COVID-19. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the correlation between BCG coverage (2010-2018) and COVID-19 related parameters (Cases per million, and deaths per million) of various countries at two different time-points (March 01, 2020, and June 29, 2020) using various datasets.7,8 We observed a weak but significant positive correlation (spearmen rho= +0.2-0.4, p< 0.05) between the BCG vaccination coverage and COVID-19 cases and deaths (as of March 01, 2020). However, there was no correlation on June 29, 2020 (Table 1). Moreover, a recent study observed that the BCG vaccination in childhood was not protective against SARS-CoV-2 infection.4,5Based upon the above, we conclude that as of now there is no correlation between recent BCG vaccination coverage of a country and COVID-19. As the protective efficacy may not last beyond childhood, we should not equate the childhood vaccination policy of a country with the recent vaccination in ongoing trials. Until we have the results of ongoing randomized clinical trials, routine use of BCG vaccine in COVID-19 management should be discouraged and restricted to research purpose only.2},

In a context where specific vaccines are not yet available, the containment of the pandemic would be facilitated with efficient prophylaxis. Methods We screened several clinical trials repositories and platforms in search of the prophylactic strategies that are investigated against COVID-19 in late April 2020. Results Up to April 27, 2020, we found 68 clinical trials targeting medical workers (n = 43, 63%), patients relatives (n = 16, 24%) or individuals at risk of severe COVID-19 (n = 5, 7%). (Hydroxy)chloroquine was the most frequently evaluated treatment (n = 46, 68%), before BCG vaccine (n = 5, 7%). Sixty-one (90%) clinical trials were randomized with a median of planned inclusions of 600 (IQR 255–1515). Conclusion The investigated prophylaxis strategies cover both pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis and study numerous immune enhancers and antivirals, although most research efforts are focused on (hydroxy)chloroquine.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 had already killed more than 400,000 patients around the world according to data on 7 June 2020. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is developed from live-attenuated Mycobacterium bovis, which is a microorganism found in a cow. Discovered by Dr. Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin since 1921, the BCG has served as a protection against tuberculosis and its complications. It is noticeable that countries which use mandatory BCG vaccination approach had lower COVID-19 infection and death rate. Current review aims to clarify this issue through epidemiological illustration of correlation between national BCG immunization and COVID-19 mortality, in addition to biological background of BCG-induced immunity Epidemiological data shows that universal BCG policy countries have lower median mortality rate compare to countries with past universal BCG policy and non-mass immunization BCG. (18 May 2020). Still, the links between BCG vaccination and better COVID-19 situation in certain countries are unclear, and more data on actual infection rate using SAR-CoV-2 antibody testing in large population sample is crucial for disease spreading comparison. Two immunological mechanisms, heterologous effects of adaptive immunity and trained innate immunity which induced by BCG vaccination, may explain host tolerance against COVID-19 infection, however, there is no direct evidence to support this biological background. Clinical trials related to BCG vaccination against COVID-19 are under investigation. Without a strong evidence, BCG must not be recommended for COVID-19 prevention, although, this should not be absolute contraindication. Risk of local and systemic complications from the vaccine should be informed to individual, who request BCG immunization.},

Materials and Methods: Combined published and unpublished data from comparative studies on BCG versus mitomycin C for superficial bladder carcinoma considering possible confounding factors were analyzed. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were used as primary effect size estimate. Toxicity data were evaluated descriptively. Results: In 11 eligible clinical trials 1,421 patients were treated with BCG and 1,328 were treated with mitomycin C. Within the overall median followup time of 26 months 38.6% of the patients in the BCG group and 46.4% of those in the mitomycin C group had tumor recurrence. In 7 of 11 studies BCG was significantly superior to mitomycin C, in 3 studies no significant difference was found, while in 1 study mitomycin C was significantly superior to BCG. An overall statistically significant superiority of BCG versus mitomycin C efficacy in reducing tumor recurrence was detected (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.84, p = 0.005). In the subgroup treated with BCG maintenance all 6 individual studies showed a significant superiority of BCG over mitomycin C (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.53, p <0.001). In 4 of the 5 studies with reported data on toxicity BCG associated cystitis was significantly more frequent than in the mitomycin C group (53.8% versus 39.2%). The combined cystitis OR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.48 to 2.23, p <0.001). The OR for cystitis in the BCG maintenance group did not significantly differ from that in the nonmaintenance therapy group. Conclusions: The results suggest superiority of BCG over mitomycin C for prevention of tumor recurrences in the combined data and particularly in the BCG maintenance treatment subgroup, irrespective of the actual (intermediate or high) tumor risk status. The toxicity with BCG is higher but does not differ between BCG maintenance and nonmaintenance groups.

	abstract = {The non-specific beneficial effects of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination suggest that this vaccine might play a role in protecting individuals against severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Several studies propose that BCG vaccination may increase the body's immunity, thereby preventing respiratory infections caused by other respiratory pathogens. As the number of deaths due to COVID-19 is increasing rapidly and there is no specific treatment available to date, scientists are evaluating the effectiveness of already approved drugs as therapies against COVID-19, and the results were found to vary widely: from no significant effect being observed to a reduction in the time taken for clinical improvement. This study thus aims to evaluate whether it is worth performing clinical trials to examine the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. We herein emphasize the need to conduct phase III randomized controlled trials with adequate sample size and quality to investigate the effects of the BCG vaccine on COVID-19. In the event that BCG vaccination provides non-specific protection against COVID-19, administering it could be helpful in controlling the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases during future pandemics.},

	abstract = {<h3>ABSTRACT</h3> <h3>BACKGROUND</h3> The Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is the new form of an acute infectious respiratory disease and has quickly spread over most continents in the world. Recently, it has been shown that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) might protect against COVID-19. This study aims to investigate the possible correlation between BCG vaccination and morbidity/mortality/recovery rate associated with COVID-19 infection. <h3>METHODS</h3> Data of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and population were obtained from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (Accessed on 12 June, 2020). To have meaningful comparisons among countries’ mortality and recovery rates, we only choose those countries with COVID-19 infected cases at least 200. The Poisson regression and logistic regression were used to explore the relationship between BCG vaccination and morbidity, mortality and recovery rates. <h3>RESULTS</h3> Among those 158 countries with at least 200 COVID-19 infected cases, there were 141 countries with BCG vaccination information available. The adjusted rates ratio of COVID-19 confirmed cases for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination was 0.339 (with 95% CI= (0.338,0.340)). Moreover, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of death and recovery after coronavirus infected for Current BCG vaccination vs. non-Current BCG vaccination were 0.258 (with 95% CI= (0.254,0.261)) and 2.151 (with 95% CI= (2.140,2.163)), respectively. <h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3> That data in this study show the BCG might provide the protection against COVID-19, with consequent less COVID-19 infection and deaths and more rapid recovery. BCG vaccine might bridge the gap before the disease-specific vaccine is developed, but this hypothesis needs to be further tested in rigorous randomized clinical trials.},

Previous studies have indicated a relationship between leukopenia and the presence of infection in patients with acute leukemia (2-4) and various types of agranulocytosis (5-7). Chemotherapeutic agents with bone marrow toxicity are being used with increasing frequency in malignant and other chronic diseases. Also, a high incidence of infection has accompanied the use of these agents as immunosuppressive therapy in patients receiving organ transplantation (8). The present study examines the quantitative relationships between the presence of infection and the degree and duration of leukopenia in patients with acute leukemia....References1.
