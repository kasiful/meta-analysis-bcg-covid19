cowan, 2020; godin, 2020; the guardian, 2020a) and, more recently, verified in academic journals (e.g., bhala, curry, martineau, agyeman, & bhopal, 2020; khunti, singh, pareek, & hanif, 2020; laurencin & mcclinton, 2020; webb hooper, nápoles, & pérez-stable, 2020), as well as through organizations responsible for gathering health statistics (eg, apm research lab, 2020; cdc, 2020; icnarc, 2020; ons, 2020). in particular, black, asian, and minority ethnic (bame) groups have emerged as more susceptible to higher morbidity and mortality than either uk or usa white groups. the office for national statistics (ons)—the central organization responsible for producing demographic statistics in the uk—recently stated that blacks were over four times more likely than whites in england and wales to die from covid-19, figures that were equivalent across both genders. the ons statistics included both confirmed and suspected cases of covid-19, as well as deaths in hospitals and the community. similarly, in the usa, the centers for disease control (cdc) has reported that almost twice as many black and hispanic individuals were hospitalized with covid-19 than are proportionally represented in the community (cdc, 2020). from a biocultural perspective, it has been heartening to witness an early recognition in both the uk and the usa that inter-population variation in susceptibilities to corona virus lies not in biology or our genes, but mostly in social and structural differences between human groups that have often led to health disparities (bhala et al., 2020; webb hooper et al., 2020) (see figure 1). the existence of such disparities is commonly referred to in anthropological and related literatures as “structural violence” (farmer, nizeye, stulac, & keshavjee, 2006; galtung, 1969). such considerations of structural inequalities in health have, for the most part, dominated emerging reports rather than questions of genes, ethnicity or(particularly, in north american parlance) the contested word “race” (fuentes et al., 2019). for example, when socioeconomic factors as well as preexisting health conditions were controlled for in the ons (2020) study cited above, the mortality risk for blacks was reduced, but remained almost twice as high as whites, and higher for males (raising questions of course about what explains the residual differences); the figures for south asians were similar (ons, 2020). the ons, at the time, was not able to include the types of jobs held by individuals among the confounders, which they argue could also affect their models. however, more recently, insidious and potentially racist allusions are beginning to emerge appearing to blame african americans as somehow responsible for the relatively large number of cases and deaths from covid-19 in the usa, stoking age-old tropes, and attributing morbidity and mortality to the behaviors and predispositions of bame groups (guardian, 2020b; strings, 2020). the guardian (2020b) has speculated about the political motivations behind these attributions. in reality, structural or social inequalities that affect individual vulnerabilities to sars-cov-2 include exposures through types of employment, whether people are working in essential transport networks carrying large numbers of people, or in small grocery shops that place bame communities at greater risk of contracting covid-19 (figure 1). these communities are also frequently at higher risk for metabolic disorders including obesity, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes, some of which are linked to higher risks for contracting covid-19, and poorer outcomes once contracted (azkur et al., 2020). given that mortality appears to result more from the inflammatory response engendered from exposure to covid-19, as well as its ability to attack many organs in the body, metabolic diseases render many individuals at high risk for adverse outcomes once they become ill (matricardi, dal negro, & nisini, 2020). front-line health workers are also at high risk for contracting covid-19. in england, the national health service (nhs) has long imported qualified doctors, nurses, and carers from abroad (now 13% of all staff), and proportionally twice as many bame individuals work for the nhs as in the rest of the economy (baker, 2019). a recent report also suggested that bame health workers have had less access to personal protective equipment than their white european counterparts (royal college of nursing, 2020). in the usa, there are additional social problems faced by minority groups, such as the potential lack of health care due to costs of health insurance. this is a problem that bame groups do not face in the uk with its national health service. in addition, bame communities often live in neighborhoods classified as food deserts which affect access to healthy foods, or they lack green spaces for exercise and fresh air. ethnic minorities frequently live in areas or regions that are more polluted than others, situations which can be exacerbated by lack of service provision including garbage collection. these kinds of “structural violence” are common for ethnic minorities in many northern nations, and can mostly explain inter-group susceptibility to covid-19. nevertheless, are there potentially any underlying biological realities that could also render some groups more vulnerable to poorer outcomes after contracting the disease? there are clearly differences in susceptibility based on both age and gender that remain little understood, at present, and that are not wholly due to either social or behavioral differences. in addition, there may be variation in the way that some individuals respond to drugs—so-called pharmacogenetic differences—that might explain recovery times or reactions to particular pharmaceutical interventions (shah, 2005). just as some individuals appear immune to hiv-aids (carrington et al., 1996), similarly some individuals may also, for unknown reasons, be immune to sars-cov-2, or are asymptomatic carriers (azkur et al., 2020). there have been a few attempts to explore these underlying biological issues in relation to sars viruses. one example is the study of population differences in genetic polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ace2) receptor, found in many human organs such as the lung, brain, kidney, heart and gut, and through which related corona viruses (sars-cov-1, and the more recent sars-cov-2) binds to the new host, primarily through lung entry. although east asians appear to have higher expression of ace2 levels compared to people of european descent, there does not seem to be any association between genetic variants and covid-19 outcome (cao et al., 2020). similarly, nguyen et al. (2020) performed an in silico analysis of different classes of human leukocyte antigen (hla) genotypes for their response to exposure to sars-cov-2, and also mapped different hla variants globally to estimate the potential epidemiological impact at the population level. again, while one hla variant appeared to confer greater protection, another might render an individual more susceptible to covid-19, but neither were suggested to have an impact at a global level. more recently, genomics england (2020) has announced that they will begin a study of 20 000 hospitalized patients who have experienced the worst symptoms of covid-19, and will compare them to 15 000 patients who have had only mild symptoms, in an effort to explore potential genomic differences in susceptibility to the disease. the study will undoubtedly take some time to complete, and it is not known how the research will either collect or address other risk factors alongside genetic variability. similarly, the biobank longitudinal study in the uk has requested its current participants to enroll in a subsidiary study to examine those factors (genetic or otherwise) that could influence susceptibility to covid-19 (biobank, 2020), although the proportion of bame individuals participating in biobank is lower than in the national population (fry et al., 2017).other physiological reasons for differential ethnic susceptibility to covid-19 have been suggested, including the potential of vitamin d deficiency to increase susceptibility which would adversely affect people with darker skin living in countries at higher latitudes; this connection has since been downplayed (hamiel, kozer, & youngster, 2020). we should also remember that developmental and epigenetic influences mediated through the environment (socioeconomic and otherwise) can also impact individuals in later life and, through this route, affect their susceptibility to pathogens (conching & thayer, 2019; nelson, 2009; wells, 2016). south asians, for example, are suggested to have a particular thin-fat phenotype in response to long-standing conditions of fetal under-nutrition that render them particularly vulnerable to metabolic disorders in later life (yajnik et al., 2003. these phenotypic traits also appear to be inter-generationally preserved (van steijn et al., 2009) and, as mentioned above, are currently linked to risks for covid-19 morbidity and mortality (azkur et al., 2020). life course events such as allostatic load also seem to affect the rate at which individuals age biologically, such that their biological age is higher or lower than their chronological age. these discrepancies have been measured using a variety of techniques such as analyses of telomerelength, or epigenetic age, and many ethnic minorities appear to have higher biological ages relative to their chronological ages (eg, levine & crimmins, 2014; simons et al., 2016). given that covid-19 vulnerability is positively correlated with age, those individuals with a higher biological age might also be increasingly susceptible to the effects of covid-19. more broadly, at a wider geographical level, long-standing differences between countries in terms of gross domestic product, infra-structure and histories of colonial oppression, are thought to make many southern hemisphere, lower and middle-income countries (lmics) much more vulnerable to the emerging spread of corona virus and its health consequences (bhutta, basnya, saha, & laxminarayan, 2020; roberton et al., 2020). there has also been speculation about the potentially catastrophic consequences of poor health, crowded conditions, lack of sufficient health personnel, and inability to socially distance in most of the camps housing refugees in various parts of the world (kassem, 2020; nott, 2020). the statistics, in fact, looked encouraging early on, in that the numbers of cases and deaths appeared much lower in lmics than in europe, although the african continent has been temporally behind europe in exposure to sars-cov-2 (hashim, 2020). in south asia, the lower mortality rate was variably assigned to the demographic structure of the population, with a majority of younger individuals who may have been less likely to transmit sars-cov-2 (hashim, 2020). in addition, it was speculated that exposure to more diseases during early life, or a more intense pattern of childhood immunizations, might somehow prime individuals to be more resistant to the virus. early reports, however, that there might be some protection afforded by thebacillus calmette-guérin(bcg) vaccination against tuberculosis (which was also routinely given to most children in the uk until 2005) have since been questioned (kumar & meena, 2020; redelman-sidi, 2020). another factor that might shield refugee camps from the pandemic is that they remain relatively isolated from tourist and visitor trails, while travel by inmates outside the camps is often restricted (abdalfatah, 2020). however, more recently, the pandemic has been accelerating in southern countries, with rapidly increasing rates in the african continent and in south asia, providing challenges to the health care systems in many countries (johns hopkins university, 2020; vaidyanathan, 2020), and an ominous portent of what might be the ultimate morbidity and mortality rates in lmics. finally, and by no means least in relation to structural inequalities, as we develop new potential treatments and vaccines to treat covid-19, we must also be aware of the need to test and gather data on ethnic minorities, who are generally poorly represented in clinical trials and longitudinal health cohort studies (jackson & kuhlman, 2019). the study of health in relation to structural inequalities, racism, and so-called “racial medicine” has often been the focus of anthropology (eg, conching & thayer, 2019; ifekwunigwe et al., 2017; weigmann, 2006).we should be reassured, barring selective political rhetoric that has the potential to be extremely damaging, by the evident recognition in press outlets, popular science sources, and elsewhere, that ethnic inequalities in health do not reflect underlying human biology or genes, but rather the social environment in which human individuals find themselves embedded. we can only hope that the current pandemic might be an eventual catalyst to addressing and remediating these inequalities after decades of increasingly widening inequality gaps within human societies (dorling, 2013; marmot, 2015). thanks are due to barry bogin, rodney brittan, and lynnette sievert for comments on an earlier draft of the manuscript, as well as the two anonymous reviewers who made valuable suggestions. gillian bentley: conceptualization;

bcg site to pfizer‐biontech covid‐19 vaccine our patient developed erythematous reaction of the bcg site to pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine. as covid-19 vaccination is expanded to younger ages, we have to pay attention to such reactions. dear editor, a 22-year-old woman presented to the dermatology department with a pruritic rash. her past medical history was not contributory, and her grandmother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. she was a nurse working for our hospital and received the first dose of pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine 7 days earlier. six days after vaccination, she developed erythema on her left upper arm. physical examination revealed edematous, erythematous lesions on and around the bacille calmette-guérin (bcg) inoculation site (figure 1a). the white cell blood count was normal, as was the biochemical screen: wbc 5540/μl (60.8% neuts, 31.8% lymphs, 4.5% monos, 2.0% eos, and 0.9% basos), rbc 4.64 × 106/μl, hgb 14.1 g/dl, hct 40.8%, plt 10.1 × 104/μl, alb 4.9 g/dl, ast 18 u/l, and alt 12 iu/l. c-reacted protein (0.04 mg/dl) and antistreptolysin o (17 iu/ml) antibody levels were normal. histopathological examination of a biopsy specimen (figure 1b) demonstrated mild exocytosis and perivascular and periadnexal infiltration of lymphocytes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue (figure 1c). phenotype of these cells showed that most were characterized by cd3+ and cd8+ cells. three days later, the lesions disappeared spontaneously. it is well known that erythema at the bcg inoculation site, like our case, is found in children with kawasaki disease (kd).1 verdori et al.2 found a 30-fold increased kd-like incidence in children in italy through the sars-cov-2 epidemic. however, kd surveillance team in japan reported that no relationship was observed between the disease and covid-19,3 and our case demonstrated no overt symptoms suggesting kd. the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine has been adapted for individuals 16 years of age and older since december 11, 2020. the u.s. food and drug administration expanded the emergency use authorization to include adolescents 12 through 15 years of age on may 10, 2021.4 japan also started the vaccination for children aged 6 months to 4 years in october 2022. after its expansion to younger age, we have to pay attention to such reactions as a rash on the bcg inoculation site. we

numerous treatment regimens; differences in survivorship/time from diagnosis of cancer; and differences in baseline characteristics such as age, gender, race, comorbidities, and other sociodemographic factors. electronic health records (ehrs) are also not specifically designed for answering cancer- or infection-related questions. they generally lack specific structured fields on infection-specific information (e.g., prior use of antimicrobial treatment or any ongoing secondary prophylaxis, exposure history of infection, onset of symptoms, etc.) and cancer-specific information (e.g., eastern cooperative oncology group [ecog] performance status, cancer status, treatment intent, treatment context, etc.). furthermore, ascertainment of causality is often extremely difficult, and attribution of death to infection or cancer is almost impossible without an autopsy. serious consideration for epidemiological and statistical challenges such as multicollinearity, measured and unmeasured confounding, interaction between various risk factors, bidirectional effect between infection and cancer, and multiple competing risks for outcomes is essential to prevent false positive and false negative claims and avoid wastage of precious resources during a pandemic. despite these challenges, carefully designed cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies can rapidly answer many questions that prospectively designed clinical trials cannot within a practicable and feasible time frame. at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, information on the risks posed to patients with cancer was extremely scant (liang et al., 2020liang w. guan w. chen r. wang w. li j. xu k. li c. ai q. lu w. liang h. et al.cancer patients in sars-cov-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in china.lancet oncol. 2020; 21: 335-337abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (2977) google scholar). at the same time, the relatively new technologies of social media platforms and ehrs offered the opportunity to quickly undertake a multi-institutional and international effort to better understand the prognosis of infected patients, with an immediate goal of improving patient care. prompted by the need for rapid assessment of clinical impact of covid-19 in patients with cancer, and to identify and share the best practices to facilitate care during this pandemic, an active conversation took place on twitter and other social media platforms, using the hashtag #covid19ncancer. a dynamic discussion ensued, and the covid-19 and cancer consortium (ccc19) was convened on march 15, 2020, by five founding institutions (desai et al., 2020desai a. warner j. kuderer n. thompson m. painter c. lyman g. lopes g. crowdsourcing a crisis response for covid-19 in oncology.nat. cancer. 2020;

37: 738-741abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (32) google scholar). the driving goal and mission statement of ccc19 is “to collect and disseminate prospective, granular, uniformly organized information on people with cancer who are diagnosed with covid-19—at scale and as rapidly as possible.” the consortium is governed by a steering committee comprised of members with a diverse clinical and research background in oncology, hematology, viral epidemiology, clinical informatics, and biostatistics. in addition to the steering committee, operational subcommittees include publications (to establish authorship guidelines for projects utilizing ccc19 data and/or resources), funding (to identify sources of funding for the consortium, disseminate this information to consortium members, and assist in the writing and critical revision of grants), epidemiology and biostatistics (to establish guidelines and provide support to investigators in designing and executing studies with the highest rigor, reproducibility, and impact), informatics (to develop and maintain the survey instrument[s] and oversee standardization of the data model, integration of data directly from ehrs, and visualization of data), and patient advocacy (to engage with cancer patient communities and advocacy networks and to coordinate with parties reaching out to ccc19). the ccc19 survey was developed to create a de-identified centralized registry housed at vanderbilt university medical center (vumc), with participation limited to health care professionals or their proxies. no protected health information (phi), as defined by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa), is collected by this centralized registry, which is irb exempt (vumc #200467). participants voluntarily report details about patients with cancer under their direct care or at their institution who have been diagnosed with covid-19. the survey respondents are anonymous and are not compensated by the consortium. initially, the survey was open to any anonymous reporter in authorized countries; however, given data quality concerns and an inability to obtain follow-up from fully anonymous participants, eligibility was subsequently restricted to participating sites. notably, while the site pi is identified to the consortium, the actual survey respondents remain anonymous. the participating sites may or may not implement their own separate irb approval. any site participating in ccc19 must execute a data transfer agreement following the standardized federal demonstration partnership (fdp) template (https://thefdp.org/default/committees/research-compliance/data-stewardship/). this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, nct04354701, and is ongoing. a centralized website (https://ccc19.org/) has been created to direct potential participants to the survey, collect feedback, and disseminate results. eligibility criteria have been kept simple and non-restrictive to ensure capturing a wide range of patients with cancer and covid-19. inclusion criteria for entering a case include suspected (presumptive positive based on clinical presentation) covid-19 or laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 and a current or past medical history of invasive malignancy (any type). no restriction is placed on how long ago a cancer diagnosis might have occurred, since patients may have received potentially lung-toxic therapy even many decades prior (e.g., bleomycin for hodgkin lymphoma or testicular cancer). exclusion criteria include participants located within countries not explicitly approved for participation by the vumc legal counsel or reports from non-healthcare providers (or their proxies). prior entry into another covid-19 registry is allowed, although all respondents are asked to report on such reporting, when it does occur, to address concerns of duplicated data (bauchner et al., 2020bauchner h. golub r.m. zylke j. editorial concern—possible reporting of the same patients with covid-19 in different reports.jama. 2020; 323: 1256crossref pubmed scopus (102) google scholar). a centralized database was developed using the redcap web browser-based platform (harris et al., 2009harris p.a. taylor r. thielke r. payne j. gonzalez n. conde j.g. research electronic data capture (redcap)–a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.j. biomed. inform. 2009; 42: 377-381crossref pubmed scopus (24761) google scholar). redcap also permits prospective and longitudinal data collection to enhance data capture of new variables or long-term outcomes as we gather more knowledge about covid-19, and accommodates structured and free-text data entry. given recent advances in natural language processing techniques, we provide free text entry for concepts difficult to capture with structured questionnaires (e.g., cancer-specific treatment, unanticipated covid-19-related complications) (savova et al., 2019savova g.k. danciu i. alamudun f. miller t. lin c. bitterman d.s. tourassi g. warner j.l. use of natural language processing to extract clinical cancer phenotypes from electronic medical records.cancer res. 2019; 79: 5463-5470crossref pubmed scopus (44) google scholar). whenever feasible, structured variables were mapped to existing terminologies to support future data harmonization efforts, e.g., snomed-ct for comorbidities and atc for medication exposures. the hemonc ontology was used to describe cancer-specific concepts such as context of systemic anti-cancer therapy (warner et al., 2019warner j.l. dymshyts d. reich c.g. gurley m.j. hochheiser h. moldwin z.h. belenkaya r. williams a.e. yang p.c. hemonc: a new standard vocabulary for chemotherapy regimen representation in the omop common data model.j. biomed. inform. 2019; 96: 103239https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103239crossref pubmed scopus (27) google scholar). we deliberately chose vocabularies identified as being standard terminologies by the observational health data sciences and informatics (ohdsi) consortium (hripcsak et al., 2015hripcsak g. duke j.d. shah n.h. reich c.g. huser v. schuemie m.j. suchard m.a. park r.w. wong i.c.k. rijnbeek p.r. et al.observational health data sciences and informatics (ohdsi): opportunities for observational researchers.stud. health technol. inform. 2015; 216: 574-578pubmed google scholar). all variables contain an “unknown” option. given the flexibility and extensibility of redcap, some sites prefer to build and maintain local instances for direct data entry instead of reporting into the central vumc instance. this also allows for the addition of site-specific variables for local needs. we designed customized forms for cancer and covid-19 as per the limited literature on covid-19 risk factors and outcomes available at the time of starting the registry and have continuously included emerging variables of clinical significance for more focused and precise analyses (figure 1a). most questions in the survey are optional, with a subset being mandatory; evolution of the knowledge of prognostic factors has led to conversion of some variables from optional to mandatory (e.g., cancer status, which is strongly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality) (kuderer et al., 2020akuderer n.m. choueiri t.k. shah d.p. shyr y. rubinstein s.m. rivera d.r. shete s. hsu c.-y. desai a. de lima lopes jr., g. et al.covid-19 and cancer consortiumclinical impact of covid-19 on patients with cancer (ccc19): a cohort study.lancet. 2020; 395: 1907-1918abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (1100) google scholar). the survey is designed such that incompletely filled-out forms can be completed at a later time, using a unique link that is generated within the redcap system and available only to the respondent. data entry personnel can voluntarily return and add outcome data and/or complete the forms using this unique link provided to them as the patient’s clinical course evolves. the survey includes the following five data collection forms: (1) patient demographics, (2) covid-19 details, (3) cancer details, (4) respondent details, and (5) follow-up. further details about the content of the forms can be found at https://ccc19.org/faqs. due to the challenges of temporality as well as the need to define composite outcomes and risk factors, a large number of derived variables have been developed. these have evolved in parallel with the main survey instruments. given that many of the variables are optional and that there is an “unknown” option for each variable, missingness and excessive unknown responses are concerns for both raw and derived variables. in order to mitigate these concerns, we developed a quality score that is used to evaluate case reports for targeted improvement. data problems are classified as minor (1 point), moderate (3 points), and major (5 points) (table 1). quality score metrics are periodically returned to sites, and the overall change in the cumulative distribution of quality scores is shared with the consortium on a regular basis.table 1quality score metricsmajor problems (5 points)moderate problems (3 points)minor problems (1 point)high levels of baseline missingnesscancer status missingcancer status unknownlarge number of unknownsecog performance status missingecog performance status unknown30-day f/u is 60+ days overdue30-day f/u is 30–59 days overduedeath status missing or unknownmetastatic status missing or unknownbaseline covid-19 severity missing or unknownicu status missing or unknownhospitalization status missing or unknownintubation status missing or unknowno2 need missing or unknowndays to death missing or unknownadt missing or unknown (prostate cancer only)biomarkers missing or unknown (breast cancer only)bcg exposure missing or unknown (bladder cancer only)adt, androgen deprivation therapy;

90th percentile, 71 min) per case (figure 2a). an analysis of data quality at the time of the fourth data lock (july 31, 2020) indicated that the overall quality of reports was acceptable but in need of improvement, with 78% of cases meeting the predetermined threshold (figure 2b). after targeted queries to sites, the cumulative quality score improved significantly, with 88% of cases meeting the predetermined threshold. in a very short period of time, ccc19 formed to become one of the largest consortia focused on covid-19 and its effects on patients with cancer. in addition to publications to date, a number of specific subprojects are underway to make the most of this large data resource. the web-based survey asks for information that is collected during routine clinical care. there is an indirect risk to the patient that the respondent could inadvertently disclose phi in a free text response field; all structured fields (such as age) are constructed such that phi cannot be disclosed. clear instructions are given within the survey that no phi is to be recorded, and the survey respondent is also advised to speak with their privacy office if they have any concerns about sharing non-phi clinical data. breach of confidentiality poses a risk to institutions and to individuals. the benefits of critical information for understanding the burden of novel infection and methods to prevent and treat complications still outweigh the risks of data collection in such registries; thus local irb offices are encouraged to approve the study with waiver of hipaa authorization. a separate risk to scientific integrity is that of excessive missing or unknown data. in our early analyses, expediency was key, and a high level of missingness was deemed acceptable; standard statistical methods of multiple imputation were used to partially address this issue. unknown responses are more problematic, although they may occasionally be medically appropriate, such as cancer status being unknown in the period between initiation of a treatment and the first assessment by imaging or physical exam. for example, in our initial analysis, we found that having an unknown number of comorbidities was associated with increased 30-day all-cause mortality, paor 6.77 (95% ci, 1.42–32.33) (kuderer et al., 2020akuderer n.m. choueiri t.k. shah d.p. shyr y. rubinstein s.m. rivera d.r. shete s. hsu c.-y. desai a. de lima lopes jr., g. et al.covid-19 and cancer consortiumclinical impact of covid-19 on patients with cancer (ccc19): a cohort study.lancet. 2020;

others are considered for full analyses, subject to standard additional project-specific exclusion criteria. this generally follows the model of “analytic cases” as used by the cancer registry community (mallin et al., 2013mallin k. palis b.e. watroba n. stewart a.k. walczak d. singer j. barron j. blumenthal w. haydu g. edge s.b. completeness of american cancer registry treatment data: implications for quality of care research.j. am. coll. surg. 2013;

however, this research capacity is essential to quickly capture and disseminate findings via informatics platforms during novel pandemics in future. ehr integration will also allow better data harmonization efforts with other groups building complementary registries. finally, this is a completely voluntary project, so identifying and securing funding is essential to maintain the sustainability of such endeavors. the consortium would like to acknowledge the writing committee who drafted this manuscript: dimpy p. shah, md, phd;

numerous treatment regimens; differences in survivorship/time from diagnosis of cancer; and differences in baseline characteristics such as age, gender, race, comorbidities, and other sociodemographic factors. electronic health records (ehrs) are also not specifically designed for answering cancer- or infection-related questions. they generally lack specific structured fields on infection-specific information (e.g., prior use of antimicrobial treatment or any ongoing secondary prophylaxis, exposure history of infection, onset of symptoms, etc.) and cancer-specific information (e.g., eastern cooperative oncology group [ecog] performance status, cancer status, treatment intent, treatment context, etc.). furthermore, ascertainment of causality is often extremely difficult, and attribution of death to infection or cancer is almost impossible without an autopsy. serious consideration for epidemiological and statistical challenges such as multicollinearity, measured and unmeasured confounding, interaction between various risk factors, bidirectional effect between infection and cancer, and multiple competing risks for outcomes is essential to prevent false positive and false negative claims and avoid wastage of precious resources during a pandemic. despite these challenges, carefully designed cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort studies can rapidly answer many questions that prospectively designed clinical trials cannot within a practicable and feasible time frame. at the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic, information on the risks posed to patients with cancer was extremely scant (liang et al., 2020liang w. guan w. chen r. wang w. li j. xu k. li c. ai q. lu w. liang h. et al.cancer patients in sars-cov-2 infection: a nationwide analysis in china.lancet oncol. 2020; 21: 335-337abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (2977) google scholar). at the same time, the relatively new technologies of social media platforms and ehrs offered the opportunity to quickly undertake a multi-institutional and international effort to better understand the prognosis of infected patients, with an immediate goal of improving patient care. prompted by the need for rapid assessment of clinical impact of covid-19 in patients with cancer, and to identify and share the best practices to facilitate care during this pandemic, an active conversation took place on twitter and other social media platforms, using the hashtag #covid19ncancer. a dynamic discussion ensued, and the covid-19 and cancer consortium (ccc19) was convened on march 15, 2020, by five founding institutions (desai et al., 2020desai a. warner j. kuderer n. thompson m. painter c. lyman g. lopes g. crowdsourcing a crisis response for covid-19 in oncology.nat. cancer. 2020;

37: 738-741abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (32) google scholar). the driving goal and mission statement of ccc19 is “to collect and disseminate prospective, granular, uniformly organized information on people with cancer who are diagnosed with covid-19—at scale and as rapidly as possible.” the consortium is governed by a steering committee comprised of members with a diverse clinical and research background in oncology, hematology, viral epidemiology, clinical informatics, and biostatistics. in addition to the steering committee, operational subcommittees include publications (to establish authorship guidelines for projects utilizing ccc19 data and/or resources), funding (to identify sources of funding for the consortium, disseminate this information to consortium members, and assist in the writing and critical revision of grants), epidemiology and biostatistics (to establish guidelines and provide support to investigators in designing and executing studies with the highest rigor, reproducibility, and impact), informatics (to develop and maintain the survey instrument[s] and oversee standardization of the data model, integration of data directly from ehrs, and visualization of data), and patient advocacy (to engage with cancer patient communities and advocacy networks and to coordinate with parties reaching out to ccc19). the ccc19 survey was developed to create a de-identified centralized registry housed at vanderbilt university medical center (vumc), with participation limited to health care professionals or their proxies. no protected health information (phi), as defined by the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (hipaa), is collected by this centralized registry, which is irb exempt (vumc #200467). participants voluntarily report details about patients with cancer under their direct care or at their institution who have been diagnosed with covid-19. the survey respondents are anonymous and are not compensated by the consortium. initially, the survey was open to any anonymous reporter in authorized countries; however, given data quality concerns and an inability to obtain follow-up from fully anonymous participants, eligibility was subsequently restricted to participating sites. notably, while the site pi is identified to the consortium, the actual survey respondents remain anonymous. the participating sites may or may not implement their own separate irb approval. any site participating in ccc19 must execute a data transfer agreement following the standardized federal demonstration partnership (fdp) template (https://thefdp.org/default/committees/research-compliance/data-stewardship/). this study is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, nct04354701, and is ongoing. a centralized website (https://ccc19.org/) has been created to direct potential participants to the survey, collect feedback, and disseminate results. eligibility criteria have been kept simple and non-restrictive to ensure capturing a wide range of patients with cancer and covid-19. inclusion criteria for entering a case include suspected (presumptive positive based on clinical presentation) covid-19 or laboratory-confirmed sars-cov-2 and a current or past medical history of invasive malignancy (any type). no restriction is placed on how long ago a cancer diagnosis might have occurred, since patients may have received potentially lung-toxic therapy even many decades prior (e.g., bleomycin for hodgkin lymphoma or testicular cancer). exclusion criteria include participants located within countries not explicitly approved for participation by the vumc legal counsel or reports from non-healthcare providers (or their proxies). prior entry into another covid-19 registry is allowed, although all respondents are asked to report on such reporting, when it does occur, to address concerns of duplicated data (bauchner et al., 2020bauchner h. golub r.m. zylke j. editorial concern—possible reporting of the same patients with covid-19 in different reports.jama. 2020; 323: 1256crossref pubmed scopus (102) google scholar). a centralized database was developed using the redcap web browser-based platform (harris et al., 2009harris p.a. taylor r. thielke r. payne j. gonzalez n. conde j.g. research electronic data capture (redcap)–a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.j. biomed. inform. 2009; 42: 377-381crossref pubmed scopus (24761) google scholar). redcap also permits prospective and longitudinal data collection to enhance data capture of new variables or long-term outcomes as we gather more knowledge about covid-19, and accommodates structured and free-text data entry. given recent advances in natural language processing techniques, we provide free text entry for concepts difficult to capture with structured questionnaires (e.g., cancer-specific treatment, unanticipated covid-19-related complications) (savova et al., 2019savova g.k. danciu i. alamudun f. miller t. lin c. bitterman d.s. tourassi g. warner j.l. use of natural language processing to extract clinical cancer phenotypes from electronic medical records.cancer res. 2019; 79: 5463-5470crossref pubmed scopus (44) google scholar). whenever feasible, structured variables were mapped to existing terminologies to support future data harmonization efforts, e.g., snomed-ct for comorbidities and atc for medication exposures. the hemonc ontology was used to describe cancer-specific concepts such as context of systemic anti-cancer therapy (warner et al., 2019warner j.l. dymshyts d. reich c.g. gurley m.j. hochheiser h. moldwin z.h. belenkaya r. williams a.e. yang p.c. hemonc: a new standard vocabulary for chemotherapy regimen representation in the omop common data model.j. biomed. inform. 2019; 96: 103239https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103239crossref pubmed scopus (27) google scholar). we deliberately chose vocabularies identified as being standard terminologies by the observational health data sciences and informatics (ohdsi) consortium (hripcsak et al., 2015hripcsak g. duke j.d. shah n.h. reich c.g. huser v. schuemie m.j. suchard m.a. park r.w. wong i.c.k. rijnbeek p.r. et al.observational health data sciences and informatics (ohdsi): opportunities for observational researchers.stud. health technol. inform. 2015; 216: 574-578pubmed google scholar). all variables contain an “unknown” option. given the flexibility and extensibility of redcap, some sites prefer to build and maintain local instances for direct data entry instead of reporting into the central vumc instance. this also allows for the addition of site-specific variables for local needs. we designed customized forms for cancer and covid-19 as per the limited literature on covid-19 risk factors and outcomes available at the time of starting the registry and have continuously included emerging variables of clinical significance for more focused and precise analyses (figure 1a). most questions in the survey are optional, with a subset being mandatory; evolution of the knowledge of prognostic factors has led to conversion of some variables from optional to mandatory (e.g., cancer status, which is strongly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality) (kuderer et al., 2020akuderer n.m. choueiri t.k. shah d.p. shyr y. rubinstein s.m. rivera d.r. shete s. hsu c.-y. desai a. de lima lopes jr., g. et al.covid-19 and cancer consortiumclinical impact of covid-19 on patients with cancer (ccc19): a cohort study.lancet. 2020; 395: 1907-1918abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (1100) google scholar). the survey is designed such that incompletely filled-out forms can be completed at a later time, using a unique link that is generated within the redcap system and available only to the respondent. data entry personnel can voluntarily return and add outcome data and/or complete the forms using this unique link provided to them as the patient’s clinical course evolves. the survey includes the following five data collection forms: (1) patient demographics, (2) covid-19 details, (3) cancer details, (4) respondent details, and (5) follow-up. further details about the content of the forms can be found at https://ccc19.org/faqs. due to the challenges of temporality as well as the need to define composite outcomes and risk factors, a large number of derived variables have been developed. these have evolved in parallel with the main survey instruments. given that many of the variables are optional and that there is an “unknown” option for each variable, missingness and excessive unknown responses are concerns for both raw and derived variables. in order to mitigate these concerns, we developed a quality score that is used to evaluate case reports for targeted improvement. data problems are classified as minor (1 point), moderate (3 points), and major (5 points) (table 1). quality score metrics are periodically returned to sites, and the overall change in the cumulative distribution of quality scores is shared with the consortium on a regular basis.table 1quality score metricsmajor problems (5 points)moderate problems (3 points)minor problems (1 point)high levels of baseline missingnesscancer status missingcancer status unknownlarge number of unknownsecog performance status missingecog performance status unknown30-day f/u is 60+ days overdue30-day f/u is 30–59 days overduedeath status missing or unknownmetastatic status missing or unknownbaseline covid-19 severity missing or unknownicu status missing or unknownhospitalization status missing or unknownintubation status missing or unknowno2 need missing or unknowndays to death missing or unknownadt missing or unknown (prostate cancer only)biomarkers missing or unknown (breast cancer only)bcg exposure missing or unknown (bladder cancer only)adt, androgen deprivation therapy;

however, this research capacity is essential to quickly capture and disseminate findings via informatics platforms during novel pandemics in future. ehr integration will also allow better data harmonization efforts with other groups building complementary registries. finally, this is a completely voluntary project, so identifying and securing funding is essential to maintain the sustainability of such endeavors. the consortium would like to acknowledge the writing committee who drafted this manuscript: dimpy p. shah, md, phd;

395: 497-506abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (29361) google scholar). since the first reports of cases in wuhan, sars-cov-2 spread rapidly throughout the world, and on march 11, 2020, the world health organization (who) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. millions of people have already been infected, and more than 100,000 individuals have died. despite all preventive measures, the number of cases is still rising, with europe and the united states being the hotspot of the pandemic but with increasing numbers of cases in other countries and continents. epidemiological data show that the elderly and those with co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and lung diseases) are most susceptible to covid-19 and more likely to suffer from the most severe disease complications. interestingly, young children, including infants who are more susceptible to other infections, have milder symptoms and less severe covid-19. one very important aspect in improving the outcome of patients with covid-19 is understanding the mechanisms leading to increased severity and mortality. the first event after inhalation of sars coronaviruses is invasion of epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes through binding of the sars spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors (figure 1; kuba et al., 2005kuba k. imai y. rao s. gao h. guo f. guan b. huan y. yang p. zhang y. deng w. et al.a crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) in sars coronavirus-induced lung injury.nat. med. 2005; 11: 875-879crossref pubmed scopus (2448) google scholar). this complex is proteolytically processed by transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2), leading to cleavage of ace2 and activation of the spike protein (glowacka et al., 2011glowacka i. bertram s. müller m.a. allen p. soilleux e. pfefferle s. steffen i. tsegaye t.s. he y. gnirss k. et al.evidence that tmprss2 activates the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein for membrane fusion and reduces viral control by the humoral immune response.j. virol. 2011; 85: 4122-4134crossref pubmed scopus (744) google scholar), thereby facilitating viral entry into the target cell. it has been suggested that cells in which both ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed are most susceptible to entry by coronaviruses from the sars family, among which is the virus described to cause sars (sars-cov) (shulla et al., 2011shulla a. heald-sargent t. subramanya g. zhao j. perlman s. gallagher t. a transmembrane serine protease is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor and activates virus entry.j. virol. 2011; 85: 873-882crossref pubmed scopus (465) google scholar) and, most likely, also sars-cov-2. viral entry and cell infection trigger the host’s immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells. the receptor and signaling mechanisms actually responsible for induction of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines or chemokines, by sars-cov-2 have not yet been identified. however, two possible mechanisms can be envisaged; one is represented by release of danger signal molecules, such as certain cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1α [il-1α] and il-8) or atp, and a second may involve a different recognition pathway mediated in professional immune cells by known pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (tlrs) (figure 1). indeed, it has been shown that sars-cov is recognized by tlr3 and tlr4 that induce an inflammatory reaction through both myd88 (sheahan et al., 2008sheahan t. morrison t.e. funkhouser w. uematsu s. akira s. baric r.s. heise m.t. myd88 is required for protection from lethal infection with a mouse-adapted sars-cov.plos pathog. 2008;

6 (e15): e00638crossref pubmed scopus (317) google scholar), and a similar process may be hypothesized for sars-cov-2. similarly, activation of the inflammasome and the il-1β pathway by sars-cov (shi et al., 2019shi c.s. nabar n.r. huang n.n. kehrl j.h. sars-coronavirus open reading frame-8b triggers intracellular stress pathways and activates nlrp3 inflammasomes.cell death discov. 2019; 5: 101crossref pubmed scopus (297) google scholar) is also likely to play an important role in pathogenesis; this hypothesis is supported by recent transcriptional identification of the il-1 pathway as being strongly upregulated in covid-19 patients (ong et al., 2020ong e.z. chan y.f.z. leong w.y. lee n.m.y. kalimuddin s. mohamed s. mohideen h. chan k.s. tan a.t. bertoletti a. et al.a dynamic immune response shapes covid-19 progression.cell host microbe. 2020;

136: 95-103crossref pubmed scopus (964) google scholar). indeed, an increasing number of very recent studies argue for an increased systemic inflammatory reaction in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection. circulating concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-6, tumor necrosis factor (tnf), mcp1, mip1a, and ip10, are increased in covid-19 patients in icu when compared to those who do not need treatment in the icu, although the concentrations of some of these cytokines are only moderately increased (huang et al., 2020huang c. wang y. li x. ren l. zhao j. hu y. zhang l. fan g. xu j. gu x. et al.clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan, china.lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (29361) google scholar). this strong increase in systemic inflammation is associated with endothelial dysfunction, reflected by elevated d-dimers (zhou et al., 2020zhou f. yu t. du r. fan g. liu y. liu z. xiang j. wang y. song b. gu x. et al.clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with covid-19 in wuhan, china: a retrospective cohort study.lancet. 2020; 395: 1054-1062abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (16882) google scholar) and hyperactive ccr6+th17+ t cells locally in the lung (xu et al., 2020xu z. shi l. wang y. zhang j. huang l. zhang c. liu s. zhao p. liu h. zhu l. et al.pathological findings of covid-19 associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome.lancet respir. med. 2020; 8: 420-422abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (5775) google scholar). this is supported by a recent study that described the sequence of immune cell population changes in one patient with mild to moderate covid-19 who recovered from infection (thevarajan et al., 2020thevarajan i. nguyen t.h.o. koutsakos m. druce j. caly l. van de sandt c.e. jia x. nicholson s. catton m. cowie b. et al.breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe covid-19.nat. med. 2020; 26: 453-455crossref pubmed scopus (707) google scholar). in this patient, the increase in systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines was minimal, even during days 7–9, when the patient was symptomatic. this suggests that a mild course of infection is associated with few systemic inflammatory effects. these data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, covid-19 infection. however, new studies suggest that immune dysfunction in covid-19 is more complex. in this respect, lymphopenia is one of the most important immune features of the disease that is associated with severity, with cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes being defective (qin et al., 2020qin c. zhou l. hu z. zhang s. yang s. tao y. xie c. ma k. shang k. wang w. et al.dysregulation of immune response in patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china.clin. infect. dis. 2020; (published online march 12, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa248crossref scopus (3019) google scholar). known age-related differences in the immune function of t cell and b cells could lead to insufficient control of viral replication, increasing disease severity. consistent with this, a recent study shows hyperinflammation of the immune response in covid-19 patients, characterized by high cytokine production capacity of circulating monocytes despite the severity of the disease (which is different from bacterial sepsis) and high systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (giamarellos-bourboulis et al., 2020giamarellos-bourboulis e.j. netea m.g. rovina n. akinosoglou k. antoniadou a. antonakos n. damoraki g. gkavogianni t. adami m.e. katsaounou p. et al.complex immune dysregulation in covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.cell host microbe. 2020; (published online april 17, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009abstract full text full text pdf scopus (1305) google scholar). these data suggest that while sustained innate immune function leads to hyperinflammation, lymphocyte numbers decline and that their function may be defective. it can thus be postulated that, when someone with a potent immune response encounters the sars-cov-2 virus, strong activation of local innate and adaptive immune responses keeps viremia under control, leading to low systemic inflammation and recovery. in contrast, in individuals with a defective immune response because of old age or co-morbidities, unrestricted viral replication leads to high concentrations of the virus, which, in turn, triggers hyperinflammation and severe complications such as ards and death (figure 2). it could therefore be argued that a rational immune-based therapy should be adapted according to the phase of the disease. in the uninfected host, the strategy should be to boost the innate immune responses to enable viral replication to be kept under control. in the later phase of the disease, the aim should be to interrupt the hyper-inflammatory loop to prevent severe complications. we therefore argue that induction of innate immune reprogramming (trained immunity) before infection may be a rational approach for boosting antiviral responses and thus preventing infection. treatment with inhibitors of the il-1/il-6 pathway has been proposed to be useful in management of hyperinflammation in severely ill patients with covid-19, and clinical trials with this strategy are underway. innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. myeloid (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) and lymphoid innate immune cells (e.g., natural killer [nk] and γδt cells) contribute to activation of host defense during infection, and they are able to eliminate the vast majority of microorganisms that infect us every day. only when this first line of defense is overwhelmed by large numbers of pathogens or very invasive microorganisms is the adaptive immune response (t and b cells) activated. for a long time, it was believed that only cells of the adaptive immune system can mount immunological memory and protect against recurrent infection. this property of lymphocytes is the basis of vaccine efficacy against specific infections. however, an increasing number of studies show that innate immune cells can also display adaptive characteristics after certain infections or vaccines, a property that is functionally similar to building immunological memory; this process has been termed trained immunity (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). greater protection against reinfection, a de facto innate immune memory, has also been reported in plants and invertebrates, which lack an adaptive immune system. studies performed in mice defective in functional adaptive immune responses, such as scid or rag1−/− mice, also show that partial protection from reinfection can be mediated by innate immune cells (kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012kleinnijenhuis j. quintin j. preijers f. joosten l.a.b. ifrim d.c. saeed s. jacobs c. van loenhout j. de jong d. stunnenberg h.g. et al.bacille calmette-guerin induces nod2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2012; 109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). finally, long-term functional changes with increased antimicrobial function of innate immune cells has been demonstrated in humans after vaccination with live vaccines (kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012kleinnijenhuis j. quintin j. preijers f. joosten l.a.b. ifrim d.c. saeed s. jacobs c. van loenhout j. de jong d. stunnenberg h.g. et al.bacille calmette-guerin induces nod2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2012; 109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). the molecular mechanisms responsible for long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and nk cells, are epigenetic in nature. an initial challenge of innate immune cells by vaccines or living pathogens during infection leads to activation of intracellular pathways that subsequently lead to upregulation of proinflammatory gene transcription. after the initial stimulus is eliminated or subsides, gene transcription returns to baseline. transcription of genes important for host defense and production of proinflammatory cytokines is subsequently increased more potently when monocytes or macrophages are re-challenged with the same or a different stimulus (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). to allow this to happen, the cell machinery must grant access to the regions of the genome that contain the target sequences and the regulatory elements of the genes involved in these processes. this is regulated through durable epigenetic modifications, which allow unfolding of the chromatin and accessibility of transcription factors to the promoter and enhancer regions of the involved immune-related genes (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). the persistence of epigenetic modifications permits cells to remain in a “trained” functional state and allows increased accessibility to proinflammatory genes, facilitating faster and increased responsiveness after re-challenge. metabolic processes leading to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites of the central metabolism regulate this process because they function as co-regulatory molecules for epigenetic enzymes (figure 3). an important aspect relates to the durability of the trained immunity response, which is ensured at two levels: through effects at the level of bone marrow precursors (central innate immune memory) and at the level of tissue macrophages (peripheral innate immune memory). while transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional changes have been identified in circulating myeloid cells months after induction of trained immunity, these cells have a lifespan of only days in the circulation. this paradox has been explained by the finding that this process also takes place at the level of myeloid bone marrow progenitors, leading to a myelopoiesis bias and release of monocytes with a heightened preparedness to respond to pathogens (mitroulis et al., 2018mitroulis i. ruppova k. wang b. chen l.s. grzybek m. grinenko t. eugster a. troullinaki m. palladini a. kourtzelis i. et al.modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors is an integral component of trained immunity.cell. 2018; 172: 147-161.e12abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (516) google scholar). importantly, a second level at which trained immunity is induced is represented by the local environments in the tissue and, in the case of respiratory infections, in the lung. experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infection. a gammaherpesvirus infection can protect against an allergic response (machiels et al., 2017machiels b. dourcy m. xiao x. javaux j. mesnil c. sabatel c. desmecht d. lallemand f. martinive p. hammad h. et al.a gammaherpesvirus provides protection against allergic asthma by inducing the replacement of resident alveolar macrophages with regulatory monocytes.nat. immunol. 2017; 18: 1310-1320crossref pubmed scopus (124) google scholar), while adenovirus infection induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently induced more pronounced anti-bacterial immunity (yao et al., 2018yao y. jeyanathan m. haddadi s. barra n.g. vaseghi-shanjani m. damjanovic d. lai r. afkhami s. chen y. dvorkin-gheva a. et al.induction of autonomous memory alveolar macrophages requires t cell help and is critical to trained immunity.cell. 2018; 175: 1634-1650.e17abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (216) google scholar). this suggests that induction of trained immunity can also provide protection from infections in which local host defense mechanisms are important in specific organs, such as the lung. the vaccine that has probably been best studied for induction of trained immunity is the tuberculosis (tb) vaccine bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg). bcg is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of mycobacterium bovis and is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world, with more than 130 million infants receiving this vaccine every year. although developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, numerous studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases, so-called off-target or non-specific effects (nses). several epidemiological studies in low-income countries have shown an association between neonatal bcg vaccination and a profound reduction in neonatal mortality (benn et al., 2013benn c.s. netea m.g. selin l.k. aaby p. a small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.trends immunol. 2013; 34: 431-439abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (358) google scholar). two meta-analyses performed at the request of the who have concluded that bcg vaccination is very likely to have important beneficial nses, although the quality of some of the studies was questioned, and it was concluded that more research is warranted (higgins et al., 2016higgins j.p.t. soares-weiser k. lópez-lópez j.a. kakourou a. chaplin k. christensen h. martin n.k. sterne j.a.c. reingold a.l. association of bcg, dtp, and measles containing vaccines with childhood mortality: systematic review.bmj. 2016; 355: i5170crossref pubmed scopus (321) google scholar). in addition, experimental studies suggest that bcg may protect against viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, human papilloma virus, and herpes simplex virus (freyne et al., 2015freyne b. marchant a. curtis n. bcg-associated heterologous immunity, a historical perspective: intervention studies in animal models of infectious diseases.trans. r. soc. trop. med. hyg. 2015;

395: 497-506abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (29361) google scholar). since the first reports of cases in wuhan, sars-cov-2 spread rapidly throughout the world, and on march 11, 2020, the world health organization (who) declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. millions of people have already been infected, and more than 100,000 individuals have died. despite all preventive measures, the number of cases is still rising, with europe and the united states being the hotspot of the pandemic but with increasing numbers of cases in other countries and continents. epidemiological data show that the elderly and those with co-morbidities (diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and lung diseases) are most susceptible to covid-19 and more likely to suffer from the most severe disease complications. interestingly, young children, including infants who are more susceptible to other infections, have milder symptoms and less severe covid-19. one very important aspect in improving the outcome of patients with covid-19 is understanding the mechanisms leading to increased severity and mortality. the first event after inhalation of sars coronaviruses is invasion of epithelial cells and type ii pneumocytes through binding of the sars spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors (figure 1; kuba et al., 2005kuba k. imai y. rao s. gao h. guo f. guan b. huan y. yang p. zhang y. deng w. et al.a crucial role of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) in sars coronavirus-induced lung injury.nat. med. 2005; 11: 875-879crossref pubmed scopus (2448) google scholar). this complex is proteolytically processed by transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2), leading to cleavage of ace2 and activation of the spike protein (glowacka et al., 2011glowacka i. bertram s. müller m.a. allen p. soilleux e. pfefferle s. steffen i. tsegaye t.s. he y. gnirss k. et al.evidence that tmprss2 activates the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein for membrane fusion and reduces viral control by the humoral immune response.j. virol. 2011; 85: 4122-4134crossref pubmed scopus (744) google scholar), thereby facilitating viral entry into the target cell. it has been suggested that cells in which both ace2 and tmprss2 are expressed are most susceptible to entry by coronaviruses from the sars family, among which is the virus described to cause sars (sars-cov) (shulla et al., 2011shulla a. heald-sargent t. subramanya g. zhao j. perlman s. gallagher t. a transmembrane serine protease is linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor and activates virus entry.j. virol. 2011; 85: 873-882crossref pubmed scopus (465) google scholar) and, most likely, also sars-cov-2. viral entry and cell infection trigger the host’s immune response, and an inflammatory cascade is initiated by innate immune cells. the receptor and signaling mechanisms actually responsible for induction of inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines or chemokines, by sars-cov-2 have not yet been identified. however, two possible mechanisms can be envisaged; one is represented by release of danger signal molecules, such as certain cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1α [il-1α] and il-8) or atp, and a second may involve a different recognition pathway mediated in professional immune cells by known pattern recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptors (tlrs) (figure 1). indeed, it has been shown that sars-cov is recognized by tlr3 and tlr4 that induce an inflammatory reaction through both myd88 (sheahan et al., 2008sheahan t. morrison t.e. funkhouser w. uematsu s. akira s. baric r.s. heise m.t. myd88 is required for protection from lethal infection with a mouse-adapted sars-cov.plos pathog. 2008;

6 (e15): e00638crossref pubmed scopus (317) google scholar), and a similar process may be hypothesized for sars-cov-2. similarly, activation of the inflammasome and the il-1β pathway by sars-cov (shi et al., 2019shi c.s. nabar n.r. huang n.n. kehrl j.h. sars-coronavirus open reading frame-8b triggers intracellular stress pathways and activates nlrp3 inflammasomes.cell death discov. 2019; 5: 101crossref pubmed scopus (297) google scholar) is also likely to play an important role in pathogenesis; this hypothesis is supported by recent transcriptional identification of the il-1 pathway as being strongly upregulated in covid-19 patients (ong et al., 2020ong e.z. chan y.f.z. leong w.y. lee n.m.y. kalimuddin s. mohamed s. mohideen h. chan k.s. tan a.t. bertoletti a. et al.a dynamic immune response shapes covid-19 progression.cell host microbe. 2020;

136: 95-103crossref pubmed scopus (964) google scholar). indeed, an increasing number of very recent studies argue for an increased systemic inflammatory reaction in patients with severe sars-cov-2 infection. circulating concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines, such as il-6, tumor necrosis factor (tnf), mcp1, mip1a, and ip10, are increased in covid-19 patients in icu when compared to those who do not need treatment in the icu, although the concentrations of some of these cytokines are only moderately increased (huang et al., 2020huang c. wang y. li x. ren l. zhao j. hu y. zhang l. fan g. xu j. gu x. et al.clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in wuhan, china.lancet. 2020; 395: 497-506abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (29361) google scholar). this strong increase in systemic inflammation is associated with endothelial dysfunction, reflected by elevated d-dimers (zhou et al., 2020zhou f. yu t. du r. fan g. liu y. liu z. xiang j. wang y. song b. gu x. et al.clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with covid-19 in wuhan, china: a retrospective cohort study.lancet. 2020;

8: 420-422abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (5775) google scholar). this is supported by a recent study that described the sequence of immune cell population changes in one patient with mild to moderate covid-19 who recovered from infection (thevarajan et al., 2020thevarajan i. nguyen t.h.o. koutsakos m. druce j. caly l. van de sandt c.e. jia x. nicholson s. catton m. cowie b. et al.breadth of concomitant immune responses prior to patient recovery: a case report of non-severe covid-19.nat. med. 2020; 26: 453-455crossref pubmed scopus (707) google scholar). in this patient, the increase in systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines was minimal, even during days 7–9, when the patient was symptomatic. this suggests that a mild course of infection is associated with few systemic inflammatory effects. these data therefore suggest that an exuberant innate immune response in the later part of the disease is the main immune dysregulation in patients with severe, but not mild, covid-19 infection. however, new studies suggest that immune dysfunction in covid-19 is more complex. in this respect, lymphopenia is one of the most important immune features of the disease that is associated with severity, with cd4 and cd8 lymphocytes being defective (qin et al., 2020qin c. zhou l. hu z. zhang s. yang s. tao y. xie c. ma k. shang k. wang w. et al.dysregulation of immune response in patients with covid-19 in wuhan, china.clin. infect. dis. 2020; (published online march 12, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa248crossref scopus (3019) google scholar). known age-related differences in the immune function of t cell and b cells could lead to insufficient control of viral replication, increasing disease severity. consistent with this, a recent study shows hyperinflammation of the immune response in covid-19 patients, characterized by high cytokine production capacity of circulating monocytes despite the severity of the disease (which is different from bacterial sepsis) and high systemic concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (giamarellos-bourboulis et al., 2020giamarellos-bourboulis e.j. netea m.g. rovina n. akinosoglou k. antoniadou a. antonakos n. damoraki g. gkavogianni t. adami m.e. katsaounou p. et al.complex immune dysregulation in covid-19 patients with severe respiratory failure.cell host microbe. 2020; (published online april 17, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.04.009abstract full text full text pdf scopus (1305) google scholar). these data suggest that while sustained innate immune function leads to hyperinflammation, lymphocyte numbers decline and that their function may be defective. it can thus be postulated that, when someone with a potent immune response encounters the sars-cov-2 virus, strong activation of local innate and adaptive immune responses keeps viremia under control, leading to low systemic inflammation and recovery. in contrast, in individuals with a defective immune response because of old age or co-morbidities, unrestricted viral replication leads to high concentrations of the virus, which, in turn, triggers hyperinflammation and severe complications such as ards and death (figure 2). it could therefore be argued that a rational immune-based therapy should be adapted according to the phase of the disease. in the uninfected host, the strategy should be to boost the innate immune responses to enable viral replication to be kept under control. in the later phase of the disease, the aim should be to interrupt the hyper-inflammatory loop to prevent severe complications. we therefore argue that induction of innate immune reprogramming (trained immunity) before infection may be a rational approach for boosting antiviral responses and thus preventing infection. treatment with inhibitors of the il-1/il-6 pathway has been proposed to be useful in management of hyperinflammation in severely ill patients with covid-19, and clinical trials with this strategy are underway. innate immune responses are the first line of defense against invading pathogens. myeloid (e.g., neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages) and lymphoid innate immune cells (e.g., natural killer [nk] and γδt cells) contribute to activation of host defense during infection, and they are able to eliminate the vast majority of microorganisms that infect us every day. only when this first line of defense is overwhelmed by large numbers of pathogens or very invasive microorganisms is the adaptive immune response (t and b cells) activated. for a long time, it was believed that only cells of the adaptive immune system can mount immunological memory and protect against recurrent infection. this property of lymphocytes is the basis of vaccine efficacy against specific infections. however, an increasing number of studies show that innate immune cells can also display adaptive characteristics after certain infections or vaccines, a property that is functionally similar to building immunological memory; this process has been termed trained immunity (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). greater protection against reinfection, a de facto innate immune memory, has also been reported in plants and invertebrates, which lack an adaptive immune system. studies performed in mice defective in functional adaptive immune responses, such as scid or rag1−/− mice, also show that partial protection from reinfection can be mediated by innate immune cells (kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012kleinnijenhuis j. quintin j. preijers f. joosten l.a.b. ifrim d.c. saeed s. jacobs c. van loenhout j. de jong d. stunnenberg h.g. et al.bacille calmette-guerin induces nod2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2012; 109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). finally, long-term functional changes with increased antimicrobial function of innate immune cells has been demonstrated in humans after vaccination with live vaccines (kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012kleinnijenhuis j. quintin j. preijers f. joosten l.a.b. ifrim d.c. saeed s. jacobs c. van loenhout j. de jong d. stunnenberg h.g. et al.bacille calmette-guerin induces nod2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2012; 109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). the molecular mechanisms responsible for long-term reprogramming of innate immune cells, such as monocytes, macrophages, and nk cells, are epigenetic in nature. an initial challenge of innate immune cells by vaccines or living pathogens during infection leads to activation of intracellular pathways that subsequently lead to upregulation of proinflammatory gene transcription. after the initial stimulus is eliminated or subsides, gene transcription returns to baseline. transcription of genes important for host defense and production of proinflammatory cytokines is subsequently increased more potently when monocytes or macrophages are re-challenged with the same or a different stimulus (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). to allow this to happen, the cell machinery must grant access to the regions of the genome that contain the target sequences and the regulatory elements of the genes involved in these processes. this is regulated through durable epigenetic modifications, which allow unfolding of the chromatin and accessibility of transcription factors to the promoter and enhancer regions of the involved immune-related genes (netea et al., 2020netea m.g. domínguez-andrés j. barreiro l.b. chavakis t. divangahi m. fuchs e. joosten l.a.b. van der meer j.w.m. mhlanga m.m. mulder w.j.m. et al.defining trained immunity and its role in health and disease.nat. rev. immunol. 2020; (published online march 4, 2020)https://doi.org/10.1038/s41577-020-0285-6crossref pubmed scopus (877) google scholar). the persistence of epigenetic modifications permits cells to remain in a “trained” functional state and allows increased accessibility to proinflammatory genes, facilitating faster and increased responsiveness after re-challenge. metabolic processes leading to selective accumulation or depletion of certain metabolites of the central metabolism regulate this process because they function as co-regulatory molecules for epigenetic enzymes (figure 3). an important aspect relates to the durability of the trained immunity response, which is ensured at two levels: through effects at the level of bone marrow precursors (central innate immune memory) and at the level of tissue macrophages (peripheral innate immune memory). while transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional changes have been identified in circulating myeloid cells months after induction of trained immunity, these cells have a lifespan of only days in the circulation. this paradox has been explained by the finding that this process also takes place at the level of myeloid bone marrow progenitors, leading to a myelopoiesis bias and release of monocytes with a heightened preparedness to respond to pathogens (mitroulis et al., 2018mitroulis i. ruppova k. wang b. chen l.s. grzybek m. grinenko t. eugster a. troullinaki m. palladini a. kourtzelis i. et al.modulation of myelopoiesis progenitors is an integral component of trained immunity.cell. 2018; 172: 147-161.e12abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (516) google scholar). importantly, a second level at which trained immunity is induced is represented by the local environments in the tissue and, in the case of respiratory infections, in the lung. experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infection. a gammaherpesvirus infection can protect against an allergic response (machiels et al., 2017machiels b. dourcy m. xiao x. javaux j. mesnil c. sabatel c. desmecht d. lallemand f. martinive p. hammad h. et al.a gammaherpesvirus provides protection against allergic asthma by inducing the replacement of resident alveolar macrophages with regulatory monocytes.nat. immunol. 2017; 18: 1310-1320crossref pubmed scopus (124) google scholar), while adenovirus infection induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently induced more pronounced anti-bacterial immunity (yao et al., 2018yao y. jeyanathan m. haddadi s. barra n.g. vaseghi-shanjani m. damjanovic d. lai r. afkhami s. chen y. dvorkin-gheva a. et al.induction of autonomous memory alveolar macrophages requires t cell help and is critical to trained immunity.cell. 2018; 175: 1634-1650.e17abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (216) google scholar). this suggests that induction of trained immunity can also provide protection from infections in which local host defense mechanisms are important in specific organs, such as the lung. the vaccine that has probably been best studied for induction of trained immunity is the tuberculosis (tb) vaccine bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg). bcg is a live attenuated strain derived from an isolate of mycobacterium bovis and is one of the most widely used vaccines in the world, with more than 130 million infants receiving this vaccine every year. although developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, numerous studies have shown its ability to induce potent protection against other infectious diseases, so-called off-target or non-specific effects (nses). several epidemiological studies in low-income countries have shown an association between neonatal bcg vaccination and a profound reduction in neonatal mortality (benn et al., 2013benn c.s. netea m.g. selin l.k. aaby p. a small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.trends immunol. 2013; 34: 431-439abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (358) google scholar). two meta-analyses performed at the request of the who have concluded that bcg vaccination is very likely to have important beneficial nses, although the quality of some of the studies was questioned, and it was concluded that more research is warranted (higgins et al., 2016higgins j.p.t. soares-weiser k. lópez-lópez j.a. kakourou a. chaplin k. christensen h. martin n.k. sterne j.a.c. reingold a.l. association of bcg, dtp, and measles containing vaccines with childhood mortality: systematic review.bmj. 2016; 355: i5170crossref pubmed scopus (321) google scholar). in addition, experimental studies suggest that bcg may protect against viral pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus, human papilloma virus, and herpes simplex virus (freyne et al., 2015freyne b. marchant a. curtis n. bcg-associated heterologous immunity, a historical perspective: intervention studies in animal models of infectious diseases.trans. r. soc. trop. med. hyg. 2015;

109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). in order to examine potential differences in the epigenetic profile between bcg-vaccinated individuals and controls, we determined at pro-inflammatory genes the level of histone h3 acetylation at lysine 27 (h3k27ac), a mark of active promoters and enhancers. in line with previous findings, we observed increased levels of h3k27ac at the regions of il-6 and tnf-α in bcg-vaccinated individuals as compared to individuals that received placebo, suggestive of epigenetic reprogramming upon bcg vaccination (figure 3g). to further validate the solidity of the observation that bcg induces trained immunity responses in the elderly, we assessed immune responses before bcg vaccination, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination in 14 healthy volunteers aged 55 years or older that took part in an independent bcg-vaccination study (300bcg cohort, www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org). all individuals in this cohort were vaccinated with the same bcg strain used in the activate trial and pbmcs were isolated and stimulated ex vivo with staphylococcus aureus, lipopolysaccharide (lps), or mycobacterium tuberculosis, before and after vaccination to assess the magnitude of the immune memory responses. we observed a significant increase in ifn-γ upon stimulation with m. tuberculosis after bcg vaccination (figure 3h), indicative of induction of adaptive immune memory response. in addition, cytokine production also significantly increased in the elderly when cells were exposed to non-mycobacterial stimuli such as s. aureus and lps (figure 3i; figure s4a), indicative of induction of trained immunity. furthermore, we observed long-term changes in neutrophil phenotype 3 months upon bcg vaccination as compared to baseline (figure 3j). together, these findings indicate sustained trained immunity responses in the elderly and support our previous observation of non-specific beneficial effects against unrelated infections in the elderly upon bcg vaccination. in addition, we employed a targeted proteome platform to measure 92 inflammatory markers before and after bcg vaccination, which revealed no significant changes in the concentrations of circulating inflammatory proteins, including il-6 and il-18 after bcg (figure s4b; table s3). similarly, no significant changes in monocyte, granulocyte, or lymphocyte count were observed upon vaccination (figures s4c–s4e). this demonstrates that, while bcg vaccination induces trained immunity and cell responsiveness, it is not followed by excessive systemic inflammation. a trend for lower serious adverse events was recorded in the bcg vaccination group than in the placebo group (table 4). moreover, the incidence of non-serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. none of the adverse events were related to the study intervention. none of the patients developed tuberculosis.table 4list of severe adverse events and non-severe adverse events reported during the study periodserious adverse events (saes)placebo (n = 78)bcg (n = 72)p valuepresence of at least one sae,asome patients had more than one sae and/or more than one ae. no.

figures s2 and s3).figure s3time to first sepsis episode after placebo or bcg vaccination, related to table 2view large image figure viewerdownload hi-res image download (ppt) in a sub-group of 57 participants (31 placebo and 26 bcg vaccinated), we assessed production of innate immune responses at 2 time points (before and 3 months after vaccination) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs). heterologous production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-α), interleukin (il)-1β, and il-10 (trained immunity induction) (figures 3a–3e) but not of il-6 (data not shown) by pbmcs after stimulation with non-mycobacterial ligands was amplified among bcg-vaccinated individuals compared to placebo-vaccinated individuals. a trend toward amplified interferon-gamma (ifn-γ) (heterologous t cell responses) responses was also found (figure 3f). unfortunately, the number of bcg-vaccinated individuals in which cytokine data are available is too small to permit the prediction of trained immunity responses as correlates of protection. various studies have shown that the increased cytokine responses upon bcg vaccination are the result of epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes (arts et al., 2018arts r.j.w. moorlag s.j.c.f.m. novakovic b. li y. wang s.y. oosting m. kumar v. xavier r.j. wijmenga c. joosten l.a.b. et al.bcg vaccination protects against experimental viral infection in humans through the induction of cytokines associated with trained immunity.cell host microbe. 2018;

109: 17537-17542crossref pubmed scopus (1017) google scholar). in order to examine potential differences in the epigenetic profile between bcg-vaccinated individuals and controls, we determined at pro-inflammatory genes the level of histone h3 acetylation at lysine 27 (h3k27ac), a mark of active promoters and enhancers. in line with previous findings, we observed increased levels of h3k27ac at the regions of il-6 and tnf-α in bcg-vaccinated individuals as compared to individuals that received placebo, suggestive of epigenetic reprogramming upon bcg vaccination (figure 3g). to further validate the solidity of the observation that bcg induces trained immunity responses in the elderly, we assessed immune responses before bcg vaccination, 2 weeks and 3 months after vaccination in 14 healthy volunteers aged 55 years or older that took part in an independent bcg-vaccination study (300bcg cohort, www.humanfunctionalgenomics.org). all individuals in this cohort were vaccinated with the same bcg strain used in the activate trial and pbmcs were isolated and stimulated ex vivo with staphylococcus aureus, lipopolysaccharide (lps), or mycobacterium tuberculosis, before and after vaccination to assess the magnitude of the immune memory responses. we observed a significant increase in ifn-γ upon stimulation with m. tuberculosis after bcg vaccination (figure 3h), indicative of induction of adaptive immune memory response. in addition, cytokine production also significantly increased in the elderly when cells were exposed to non-mycobacterial stimuli such as s. aureus and lps (figure 3i; figure s4a), indicative of induction of trained immunity. furthermore, we observed long-term changes in neutrophil phenotype 3 months upon bcg vaccination as compared to baseline (figure 3j). together, these findings indicate sustained trained immunity responses in the elderly and support our previous observation of non-specific beneficial effects against unrelated infections in the elderly upon bcg vaccination. in addition, we employed a targeted proteome platform to measure 92 inflammatory markers before and after bcg vaccination, which revealed no significant changes in the concentrations of circulating inflammatory proteins, including il-6 and il-18 after bcg (figure s4b; table s3). similarly, no significant changes in monocyte, granulocyte, or lymphocyte count were observed upon vaccination (figures s4c–s4e). this demonstrates that, while bcg vaccination induces trained immunity and cell responsiveness, it is not followed by excessive systemic inflammation. a trend for lower serious adverse events was recorded in the bcg vaccination group than in the placebo group (table 4). moreover, the incidence of non-serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. none of the adverse events were related to the study intervention. none of the patients developed tuberculosis.table 4list of severe adverse events and non-severe adverse events reported during the study periodserious adverse events (saes)placebo (n = 78)bcg (n = 72)p valuepresence of at least one sae,asome patients had more than one sae and/or more than one ae. no.

(figure 1a ). remarkably, bcg-vaccinated mice showed a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality after iav infection (figure 1b). likewise, the lung viral load was significantly lower at day 3 post iav infection in bcg-i.v.-vaccinated mice compared with nonvaccinated controls (figure 1c). to test whether bcg vaccination likewise induces protection against sars-cov-2 infection in mice, we vaccinated transgenic mice expressing the human ace2 receptor (b6.cg-tg(k18-ace2)2prlmn/j) with bcg subcutaneously (s.c.)—which is the equivalent of intradermal bcg vaccination in humans—or i.v. at 4 weeks post vaccination, we i.n. infected the vaccinated and nonvaccinated control k18-hace2 mice with a lethal dose of sars-cov-2/sb2 (lineage b.4) (figure 1d). however, we did not observe differences in morbidity and mortality between vaccinated and control groups (figure 1e). in k18-hace2 mice, a low level of hace2 expression is detectable in the brain, and i.n. exposure to sars-cov-2 leads to rapid and severe neurological disorders that lead to death (kumari et al., 2021kumari p. rothan h.a. natekar j.p. stone s. pathak h. strate p.g. arora k. brinton m.a. kumar m. neuroinvasion and encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of sars-cov-2 in k18-hace2 mice.viruses. 2021; 13: 132crossref pubmed scopus (63) google scholar). to overcome this limitation, we next infected the hace2 mice intratracheally (i.t.) with sars-cov-2/sb2 to bypass the access of the virus to the brain via the olfactory system. however, bcg vaccination had no significant impact on either morbidity and survival (figure s1a) or pulmonary sars-cov-2 replication at either day 3 or 5 post i.t. infection with lethal or sublethal doses, respectively (figure 1f). similarly, no differences in the systemic myeloid cell numbers were observed (figure s1b, table s1). given the limitations of k18-hace2 transgenic mice expressing non-physiological levels of hace2 receptor (mccray et al., 2007mccray p.b. pewe l. wohlford-lenane c. hickey m. manzel l. shi l. netland j. jia h.p. halabi c. sigmund c.d. et al.lethal infection of k18-hace2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.j. virol. 2007; 81: 813-821crossref pubmed scopus (464) google scholar), we next examined the effects of bcg vaccination on iav and sars-cov-2 infections in a syrian golden hamster model (chan et al., 2020chan j.f. zhang a.j. yuan s. poon v.k. chan c.c. lee a.c. chan w.m. fan z. tsoi h.w. wen l. et al.simulation of the clinical and pathological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a golden syrian hamster model: implications for disease pathogenesis and transmissibility.clin. infect dis. 2020; 71: 2428-2446crossref pubmed scopus (131) google scholar). syrian golden hamsters naturally express ace2 receptor, are susceptible to sars-cov-2, and develop a moderate form of covid-19-like disease (imai et al., 2020imai m. iwatsuki-horimoto k. hatta m. loeber s. halfmann p.j. nakajima n. watanabe t. ujie m. takahashi k. ito m. et al.syrian hamsters as a small animal model for sars-cov-2 infection and countermeasure development.proc. natl. acad. sci. 2020; 117: 16587-16595crossref pubmed scopus (360) google scholar). likewise, they are moderately susceptible to iav infection (iwatsuki-horimoto et al., 2018iwatsuki-horimoto k. nakajima n. ichiko y. sakai-tagawa y. noda t. hasegawa h. kawaoka y. syrian hamster as an animal model for the study of human influenza virus infection.j. virol. 2018; 92 (e01693–17)crossref pubmed scopus (40) google scholar). at day 3 post iav infection (i.n.) (figure 2a ), bcg-i.v.-vaccinated syrian golden hamsters displayed significantly lower pulmonary viral load (figure 2b) and less weight loss (figure s2a) compared with nonvaccinated controls. we then infected bcg (s.c. and i.v.)-vaccinated syrian golden hamsters with sars-cov-2/sb2 strain (i.n.) (figure 2c). in contrast to iav infection, there were no significant differences in weight loss between bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated hamsters after sars-cov-2 infection (figure 2d). additionally, bcg vaccination had no effect on pulmonary viral loads at day 3 and 5 post infection, as determined by tcid50 (figure 2e), qpcr (brandolini et al., 2021brandolini m. taddei f. marino m.m. grumiro l. scalcione a. turba m.e. gentilini f. fantini m. zannoli s. dirani g. sambri v. correlating qrt-pcr, dpcr and viral titration for the identification and quantification of sars-cov-2: a new approach for infection management.viruses. 2021; 13: 1022crossref pubmed scopus (5) google scholar) (figure s2b), and immunofluorescence (figure 2f). the total lung leukocyte numbers were also similar between groups, with the exception of higher numbers in the bcg-i.v.-vaccinated animals after 3 days of sars-cov-2 infection (figure s2c). this increase was also reflected in the cellular populations of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), lung, spleen, and blood (figure s2d, table s1). recently, sequence analyses of sars-cov-2/sb2 strain revealed several mutations within the spike coding region (banerjee et al., 2020banerjee a. nasir j.a. budylowski p. yip l. aftanas p. christie n. ghalami a. baid k. raphenya a.r. hirota j.a. et al.isolation, sequence, infectivity, and replication kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.emerg. infect dis. 2020;

33: 108488abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (35) google scholar). however, similar to the syrian golden hamsters, bcg vaccination (s.c. or i.v.) did not provide any protection against sublethal or lethal doses of sars-cov-2/rim-1 infection in roborovski hamsters when infected at 4 weeks post vaccination (figures 3a–3d and s3a–s3c), or when infected with a sublethal dose of sars-cov-2/rim-1 at 6 months post bcg vaccination (figures s3d–s3e). collectively, these data indicate that bcg vaccination fails to provide protection against mild or severe forms of infection with sars-cov-2. to investigate why bcg vaccination offers protection against iav but not sars-cov-2 infections, we conducted in-depth comparative lung histological analyses. our data indicate that after sublethal or lethal iav infection, bcg-vaccinated mice revealed less lung damage in comparison with nonvaccinated mice (figure 4a , table s1). in contrast, bcg vaccination in k18-hace2 mice did not improve lung pathology at days 1, 3, or 5 following sars-cov-2 infection (figure 4b and table s1). likewise, after sars-cov-2 infection in bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated syrian golden hamsters that exhibit only a clinically mild disease phenotype, severe lung lesions were observed, with extensive damage to the pulmonary vasculature after 5 days of infection (figure 4c and table s1). pulmonary hemorrhage also occurs in 6-month bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated roborovski hamsters at day 3 post sublethal sars-cov-2 infection (figure s4a). in particular, we found that sars-cov-2 infection presented with (1) focal vasculitis and profound perivascular inflammatory infiltrates as well as severe endotheliitis; (2) pulmonary hemorrhage; and (3) a large quantity of lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs. vascular damage is relatively unique to sars-cov-2 infection as it is not frequently described in other pulmonary infections. in line with these findings, sars-cov-2 rna was detected in pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, and endothelial cells of a patient who died of covid-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (figure 4d). the presence of sars-cov-2 within the endothelial cells is consistent with another study (varga et al., 2020varga z. flammer a.j. steiger p. haberecker m. andermatt r. zinkernagel a.s. mehra m.r. schuepbach r.a. ruschitzka f. moch h. endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in covid-19.lancet. 2020;

28 (e5): 322-334abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (121) google scholar), we next investigated whether monocytes from bcg-vaccinated individuals react differently to iav and sars-cov-2 infection. we infected blood monocytes from healthy volunteers before and 90 days after bcg vaccination with live iav or sars-cov-2 (figure 5e). at 24 h post infection, il-1β, tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-α, and ccl2 expression was higher in response to iav infection post bcg vaccination, while sars-cov-2 induced only minimal levels of cytokines either pre or post bcg vaccination (figure 5f). thus, bcg-trained monocytes mounted an efficient cytokine response to iav infection, while this response was minimal during sars-cov-2 infection. the central mechanisms involved in innate memory responses depend on epigenetic reprogramming that modifies the chromatin accessibility and thereby the readable gene information. in the context of lavs, there are three known factors that can affect the epigenetic programming of an immune cell: (1) direct infection; (2) pamps from the microorganisms; and (3) endogenous cytokines released during the induction of the host response. the impact of these key factors occurs centrally, at the level of hscs in the bm, and peripherally at the tissue-specific level. recently, it has been demonstrated in pre-clinical (kaufmann et al., 2018kaufmann e. sanz j. dunn j.l. khan n. mendonca l.e. pacis a. tzelepis f. pernet e. dumaine a. grenier j.c. et al.bcg educates hematopoietic stem cells to generate protective innate immunity against tuberculosis.cell. 2018;

22: 2-6crossref pubmed scopus (79) google scholar). a growing body of literature indicates that live attenuated vaccines (lavs) such as bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg), measles-containing vaccines, smallpox, and oral poliovirus vaccines (opvs) induce cross-protection against other infectious diseases (namakula et al., 2020namakula r. de bree l.c.j. th a.t. netea m.g. cose s. hanevik k. monocytes from neonates and adults have a similar capacity to adapt their cytokine production after previous exposure to bcg and beta-glucan.plos one. 2020;

(figure 1a ). remarkably, bcg-vaccinated mice showed a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality after iav infection (figure 1b). likewise, the lung viral load was significantly lower at day 3 post iav infection in bcg-i.v.-vaccinated mice compared with nonvaccinated controls (figure 1c). to test whether bcg vaccination likewise induces protection against sars-cov-2 infection in mice, we vaccinated transgenic mice expressing the human ace2 receptor (b6.cg-tg(k18-ace2)2prlmn/j) with bcg subcutaneously (s.c.)—which is the equivalent of intradermal bcg vaccination in humans—or i.v. at 4 weeks post vaccination, we i.n. infected the vaccinated and nonvaccinated control k18-hace2 mice with a lethal dose of sars-cov-2/sb2 (lineage b.4) (figure 1d). however, we did not observe differences in morbidity and mortality between vaccinated and control groups (figure 1e). in k18-hace2 mice, a low level of hace2 expression is detectable in the brain, and i.n. exposure to sars-cov-2 leads to rapid and severe neurological disorders that lead to death (kumari et al., 2021kumari p. rothan h.a. natekar j.p. stone s. pathak h. strate p.g. arora k. brinton m.a. kumar m. neuroinvasion and encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of sars-cov-2 in k18-hace2 mice.viruses. 2021; 13: 132crossref pubmed scopus (63) google scholar). to overcome this limitation, we next infected the hace2 mice intratracheally (i.t.) with sars-cov-2/sb2 to bypass the access of the virus to the brain via the olfactory system. however, bcg vaccination had no significant impact on either morbidity and survival (figure s1a) or pulmonary sars-cov-2 replication at either day 3 or 5 post i.t. infection with lethal or sublethal doses, respectively (figure 1f). similarly, no differences in the systemic myeloid cell numbers were observed (figure s1b, table s1). given the limitations of k18-hace2 transgenic mice expressing non-physiological levels of hace2 receptor (mccray et al., 2007mccray p.b. pewe l. wohlford-lenane c. hickey m. manzel l. shi l. netland j. jia h.p. halabi c. sigmund c.d. et al.lethal infection of k18-hace2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.j. virol. 2007; 81: 813-821crossref pubmed scopus (464) google scholar), we next examined the effects of bcg vaccination on iav and sars-cov-2 infections in a syrian golden hamster model (chan et al., 2020chan j.f. zhang a.j. yuan s. poon v.k. chan c.c. lee a.c. chan w.m. fan z. tsoi h.w. wen l. et al.simulation of the clinical and pathological manifestations of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in a golden syrian hamster model: implications for disease pathogenesis and transmissibility.clin. infect dis. 2020; 71: 2428-2446crossref pubmed scopus (131) google scholar). syrian golden hamsters naturally express ace2 receptor, are susceptible to sars-cov-2, and develop a moderate form of covid-19-like disease (imai et al., 2020imai m. iwatsuki-horimoto k. hatta m. loeber s. halfmann p.j. nakajima n. watanabe t. ujie m. takahashi k. ito m. et al.syrian hamsters as a small animal model for sars-cov-2 infection and countermeasure development.proc. natl. acad. sci. 2020; 117: 16587-16595crossref pubmed scopus (360) google scholar). likewise, they are moderately susceptible to iav infection (iwatsuki-horimoto et al., 2018iwatsuki-horimoto k. nakajima n. ichiko y. sakai-tagawa y. noda t. hasegawa h. kawaoka y. syrian hamster as an animal model for the study of human influenza virus infection.j. virol. 2018; 92 (e01693–17)crossref pubmed scopus (40) google scholar). at day 3 post iav infection (i.n.) (figure 2a ), bcg-i.v.-vaccinated syrian golden hamsters displayed significantly lower pulmonary viral load (figure 2b) and less weight loss (figure s2a) compared with nonvaccinated controls. we then infected bcg (s.c. and i.v.)-vaccinated syrian golden hamsters with sars-cov-2/sb2 strain (i.n.) (figure 2c). in contrast to iav infection, there were no significant differences in weight loss between bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated hamsters after sars-cov-2 infection (figure 2d). additionally, bcg vaccination had no effect on pulmonary viral loads at day 3 and 5 post infection, as determined by tcid50 (figure 2e), qpcr (brandolini et al., 2021brandolini m. taddei f. marino m.m. grumiro l. scalcione a. turba m.e. gentilini f. fantini m. zannoli s. dirani g. sambri v. correlating qrt-pcr, dpcr and viral titration for the identification and quantification of sars-cov-2: a new approach for infection management.viruses. 2021; 13: 1022crossref pubmed scopus (5) google scholar) (figure s2b), and immunofluorescence (figure 2f). the total lung leukocyte numbers were also similar between groups, with the exception of higher numbers in the bcg-i.v.-vaccinated animals after 3 days of sars-cov-2 infection (figure s2c). this increase was also reflected in the cellular populations of bronchoalveolar lavage (bal), lung, spleen, and blood (figure s2d, table s1). recently, sequence analyses of sars-cov-2/sb2 strain revealed several mutations within the spike coding region (banerjee et al., 2020banerjee a. nasir j.a. budylowski p. yip l. aftanas p. christie n. ghalami a. baid k. raphenya a.r. hirota j.a. et al.isolation, sequence, infectivity, and replication kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.emerg. infect dis. 2020;

33: 108488abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (35) google scholar). however, similar to the syrian golden hamsters, bcg vaccination (s.c. or i.v.) did not provide any protection against sublethal or lethal doses of sars-cov-2/rim-1 infection in roborovski hamsters when infected at 4 weeks post vaccination (figures 3a–3d and s3a–s3c), or when infected with a sublethal dose of sars-cov-2/rim-1 at 6 months post bcg vaccination (figures s3d–s3e). collectively, these data indicate that bcg vaccination fails to provide protection against mild or severe forms of infection with sars-cov-2. to investigate why bcg vaccination offers protection against iav but not sars-cov-2 infections, we conducted in-depth comparative lung histological analyses. our data indicate that after sublethal or lethal iav infection, bcg-vaccinated mice revealed less lung damage in comparison with nonvaccinated mice (figure 4a , table s1). in contrast, bcg vaccination in k18-hace2 mice did not improve lung pathology at days 1, 3, or 5 following sars-cov-2 infection (figure 4b and table s1). likewise, after sars-cov-2 infection in bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated syrian golden hamsters that exhibit only a clinically mild disease phenotype, severe lung lesions were observed, with extensive damage to the pulmonary vasculature after 5 days of infection (figure 4c and table s1). pulmonary hemorrhage also occurs in 6-month bcg-vaccinated and nonvaccinated roborovski hamsters at day 3 post sublethal sars-cov-2 infection (figure s4a). in particular, we found that sars-cov-2 infection presented with (1) focal vasculitis and profound perivascular inflammatory infiltrates as well as severe endotheliitis; (2) pulmonary hemorrhage; and (3) a large quantity of lymphocytes infiltrating the lungs. vascular damage is relatively unique to sars-cov-2 infection as it is not frequently described in other pulmonary infections. in line with these findings, sars-cov-2 rna was detected in pneumocytes, pulmonary macrophages, and endothelial cells of a patient who died of covid-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards) (figure 4d). the presence of sars-cov-2 within the endothelial cells is consistent with another study (varga et al., 2020varga z. flammer a.j. steiger p. haberecker m. andermatt r. zinkernagel a.s. mehra m.r. schuepbach r.a. ruschitzka f. moch h. endothelial cell infection and endotheliitis in covid-19.lancet. 2020;

(2) pamps from the microorganisms; and (3) endogenous cytokines released during the induction of the host response. the impact of these key factors occurs centrally, at the level of hscs in the bm, and peripherally at the tissue-specific level. recently, it has been demonstrated in pre-clinical (kaufmann et al., 2018kaufmann e. sanz j. dunn j.l. khan n. mendonca l.e. pacis a. tzelepis f. pernet e. dumaine a. grenier j.c. et al.bcg educates hematopoietic stem cells to generate protective innate immunity against tuberculosis.cell. 2018;

183: 752-770 e22abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (58) google scholar). these studies provide a logical explanation of why short-lived innate immune cells can acquire memory and how trained immunity induced by lavs (e.g., bcg) can provide cross-protection against other infectious diseases. here our data suggest that, compared with iav infection, the unique pulmonary vascular damage induced during sars-cov-2 infection may allow for viral dissemination to the bm, effectively preventing the ability of bcg to generate trained immunity. furthermore, our results from monocytes of bcg-vaccinated humans suggest that, in contrast to iav infection, potential virulence factors from sars-cov-2 can substantially suppress the inflammatory programming of trained immune cells. thus, identifying these virulence factors can lead us closer to uncovering how sars-cov-2 hijacks our immune responses. our results contrast with a recent study demonstrating that bcg-i.v. vaccination increases survival of k18-hace2 transgenic mice following sars-cov-2 challenge (hilligan et al., 2022hilligan k.l. namasivayam s. clancy c.s. o'mard d. oland s.d. robertson s"

25: 771-784https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.68crossref pubmed scopus (819) google scholar). training effects may be mediated by metabolites functioning as cofactors for epigenetic enzymes to induce chromatin and dna modifications; upon rechallenge with a second stimulus that is unrelated to the first stimulus that induces training, trained cells can mount a more rapid and effective immune response (netea et al., 2016netea m.g. joosten l.a.b. latz e. mills k.h.g. natoli g. stunnenberg h.g. o’neill l.a.j. xavier r.j. trained immunity: a program of innate immune memory in health and disease.science. 2016;

table s2). a majority of significant metabolites belonged to the lipid superclass. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially abundant metabolites (dams) illustrated higher levels of lipid metabolites in the early bcg compared with the delayed bcg group. in contrast, early versus late bcg administration was associated with lower plasma amino acid concentrations (figure 2d).bcg-induced prominent shifts in plasma lipid pathwayscompared with the delayed bcg group, early bcg administration was associated with distinct concentrations of a range of lipid pathways and metabolites. of note, greater than half of the metabolites whose levels changed significantly (p < 0.05) between the groups belonged to the lipid superclass (figure 3a ), and 39% of dams were of the lysophospholipid (lpl) subclass (figure 3a). early bcg administration was consistently associated with robust production of selected sphingolipid, monoacylglycerol, steroid, and lpl metabolites (table s2). in contrast, palmitoylglycerols and pregnanediol disulfate (progestin steroids) were decreased in the early versus delayed bcg group (figure 3b;

25: 771-784https://doi.org/10.1038/cr.2015.68crossref pubmed scopus (819) google scholar). training effects may be mediated by metabolites functioning as cofactors for epigenetic enzymes to induce chromatin and dna modifications; upon rechallenge with a second stimulus that is unrelated to the first stimulus that induces training, trained cells can mount a more rapid and effective immune response (netea et al., 2016netea m.g. joosten l.a.b. latz e. mills k.h.g. natoli g. stunnenberg h.g. o’neill l.a.j. xavier r.j. trained immunity: a program of innate immune memory in health and disease.science. 2016;

table s2). a majority of significant metabolites belonged to the lipid superclass. unsupervised hierarchical clustering of differentially abundant metabolites (dams) illustrated higher levels of lipid metabolites in the early bcg compared with the delayed bcg group. in contrast, early versus late bcg administration was associated with lower plasma amino acid concentrations (figure 2d).bcg-induced prominent shifts in plasma lipid pathwayscompared with the delayed bcg group, early bcg administration was associated with distinct concentrations of a range of lipid pathways and metabolites. of note, greater than half of the metabolites whose levels changed significantly (p < 0.05) between the groups belonged to the lipid superclass (figure 3a ), and 39% of dams were of the lysophospholipid (lpl) subclass (figure 3a). early bcg administration was consistently associated with robust production of selected sphingolipid, monoacylglycerol, steroid, and lpl metabolites (table s2). in contrast, palmitoylglycerols and pregnanediol disulfate (progestin steroids) were decreased in the early versus delayed bcg group (figure 3b;

14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). an unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organizations, limited transmission and human disease. ten years later, a second coronavirus, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. as observed with sars-cov, mers-cov spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the arabian peninsula (∼2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for mers-cov. since the discovery of sars-cov, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1) have been discovered. sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (graham et al., 2013graham r.l. donaldson e.f. baric r.s. a decade after sars: strategies for controlling emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2013; 11: 836-848crossref pubmed scopus (493) google scholar). an appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of sars-cov and mers-cov as well as efforts to develop vaccines. in this forum, we discuss how the prior study of sars-cov and mers-cov enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). however, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the fundamental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response. sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus first isolated in wuhan, china, in december of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (zhou et al., 2020zhou p. yang x.l. wang x.g. hu b. zhang l. zhang w. si h.r. zhu y. li b. huang c.l. et al.a pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.nature. 2020; 579: 270-273crossref pubmed scopus (12911) google scholar). sars-cov-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (covid-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (guan et al., 2020guan w.j. ni z.y. hu y. liang w.h. ou c.q. he j.x. liu l. shan h. lei c.l. hui d.s.c. et al.china medical treatment expert group for covid-19clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in china.n. engl. j. med. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2002032crossref scopus (18405) google scholar). the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from covid-19. virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in china, italy, spain, germany, france, iran, and the united states and epicenters in large urban cities. most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. sars-cov-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 april 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at ∼4%. the extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. rapid implementation and deployment of an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return. coronaviruses are round, ∼120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (s) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. three additional viral structural proteins (envelope [e], membrane [m], and nucleocapsid [n]), together with a lipid membrane and ∼25–31 kilobase viral genome, comprise the virion (figure 1a; de wit et al., 2016de wit e. van doremalen n. falzarano d. munster v.j. sars and mers: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). the m and e proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the s protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. interactions between the m glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. the small structural e protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. the nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle. the s protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (de wit et al., 2016de wit e. van doremalen n. falzarano d. munster v.j. sars and mers: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). in some circumstances, the s protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. the s protein is a class i viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [ha], hiv-1 [gp160], and ebola [glycoprotein, gp]). this class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. accordingly, the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield s1 and s2 fragments, followed by further processing of s2 to yield a smaller s2′ protein. cleavage also may occur during viral egress. the s1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (rbd), whereas the carboxyl terminal s2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. the structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the sars-cov-2 s protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5å using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the sars-cov s protein (figure 1b; wrapp et al., 2020wrapp d. wang n. corbett k.s. goldsmith j.a. hsieh c.l. abiona o. graham b.s. mclellan j.s. cryo-em structure of the 2019-ncov spike in the prefusion conformation.science. 2020; 367: 1260-1263crossref pubmed scopus (82) google scholar). both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the rbd. the application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. for example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for zika virus (zikv) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. several vaccine strategies against sars-cov and mers-cov, many focused on the s protein, have been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (zhou et al., 2018zhou y. jiang s. du l. prospects for a mers-cov spike vaccine.expert rev. vaccines. 2018; 17: 677-686crossref pubmed scopus (98) google scholar). although multiple platforms of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine candidates were evaluated in human trials (e.g., viral vectored [nct03615911 and nct04170829], dna plasmid [nct00099463], and inactivated virus [nct00533741]), none advanced beyond phase 1 safety studies. similarly, no vaccines have been developed against other human coronaviruses. within months of publication of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence, work began on dozens of vaccine candidates (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1), enabled by insights from the sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development and well-characterized vaccine antigen expression platforms, including those shown to be safe in humans. several vaccines, described below, have entered phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate safety in small numbers of subjects (table 1). however, given the lack of established and tractable pre-clinical disease models of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis, these vaccines have advanced to human trials without data in animals establishing efficacy against covid-19.table 1vaccine candidates in development against sars-cov-2vaccine typeplatformprotein targetstageclinical trial designationcompany or institutionvaccine namestatusmrnalipid-encapsulated mrnasphase 1nct04283461 (45 subjects)modernamrna-1273recruitingdnadna plasmidsphase 1nct04336410 (40 subjects)inovio pharmaceuticalsino-4800recruitinghuman adenovirus (ad5)viral-vectoredsphase 1nct04313127 (108 subjects)cansino biologicsad5-ncovactivechimpanzee adenovirusviral-vectoredsphase 1/2nct04324606 (510 subjects)university of oxfordchadox1 ncov-19planned (4/20)spike proteinbacterially produced soluble protein (oral)sphase 1nct04334980 (84 subjects)symvivo corporationbactrl-spikeplanned (4/30)bcg vaccineimmune stimulatorynonephase 3nct04327206 (4170 subjects)nct04328441 (1000 subjects)murdoch childrens research instituteuniversity medical center, netherlandsbcg vaccinerecruitinginformation adapted from https://clinicaltrials.gov. open table in a new tab information adapted from https://clinicaltrials.gov. modified mrnas are synthetic molecules optimized for high-level and durable protein expression. this technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus (nct03076385 and nct03345043) and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including zikv. developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) in collaboration with moderna, mrna-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mrna expressing a prefusion-stabilized s protein. the design of the s protein antigen encoded by mrna-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class i fusion proteins of mers-cov and other coronaviruses (pallesen et al., 2017pallesen j. wang n. corbett k.s. wrapp d. kirchdoerfer r.n. turner h.l. cottrell c.a. becker m.m. wang l. shi w. et al.immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion mers-cov spike antigen.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2017;

(nct04313127). multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against covid-19 disease (table 1). bcg is a live-attenuated isolate of mycobacterium bovis delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb). multiple studies in humans and mice suggest bcg administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections (moorlag et al., 2019moorlag s.j.c.f.m. arts r.j.w. van crevel r. netea m.g. non-specific effects of bcg vaccine on viral infections.clin. microbiol. infect. 2019; 25: 1473-1478abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (269) google scholar). the mechanisms of bcg-mediated cross protections may include enhanced th1 and th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or “trained immunity” in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection. despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting, there remain substantive challenges for implementation due, in part, to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts. this approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years (e.g., influenza, dengue [denv], and respiratory syncytial viruses) for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses. while multiple vaccine platforms against sars-cov-2 focus on the s protein, questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response. (1) will neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection? do protective responses require antibody targeting of specific epitopes? is there a threshold neutralizing antibody response that protects against sars-cov-2? (2) do some of the assays commonly used in vitro to measure neutralization (e.g., pseudotyped viruses) faithfully predict protective activity in vivo? (3) what is the role of non-neutralizing anti-s antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells? could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via fc-γ-receptor interactions? (4) what is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination? (5) are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames (orfs) important for immunity, especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly? and (6) how important are cd4+ and cd8+ t cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection? while some of this information can be gleaned from pre-clinical and early vaccine trials with sars-cov and mers-cov, how certain are we that these correlates of protection will transfer to the pandemic sars-cov-2? the emergence and rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity. indeed, a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity. pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389), likely because mouse ace2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 (letko et al., 2020letko m. marzi a. munster v. functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for sars-cov-2 and other lineage b betacoronaviruses.nat. microbiol. 2020; 5: 562-569crossref pubmed scopus (1857) google scholar). transgenic mice that express human ace2 (hace2-tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing. beyond this, pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models (e.g., ferrets and hamsters) still are in early stages of development. safety is the primary consideration of any vaccine development program, given the anticipated administration to large numbers of people. beyond the expected reactogenicity profiles, studies with other distantly and closely related coronaviruses have raised concerns that humoral vaccine responses might potentiate sars-cov-2 infection via immune enhancement mechanisms. immune enhancement might occur via at least two distinct mechanisms, detailed below. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing fc-γ or complement receptors. ade of denv infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of denv or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal denv-immune igg. ade is an obstacle for denv-vaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by denv-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine dengvaxia. through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus s protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (vennema et al., 1990vennema h. de groot r.j. harbour d.a. dalderup m. gruffydd-jones t. horzinek m.c. spaan w.j. early death after feline infectious peritonitis virus challenge due to recombinant vaccinia virus immunization.j. virol. 1990; 64: 1407-1409crossref pubmed google scholar). in cell culture experiments, sars-cov entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-s antibodies through both fc-γ-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (jaume et al., 2011jaume m. yip m.s. cheung c.y. leung h.l. li p.h. kien f. dutry i. callendret b. escriou n. altmeyer r. et al.anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike antibodies trigger infection of human immune cells via a ph- and cysteine protease-independent fcγr pathway.j. virol. 2011;

94: e02015-19crossref pubmed scopus (449) google scholar). extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ade assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo. this may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ade assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. the inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many in vitro assays, reduces enhancement in an igg subclass-dependent manner. ade has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of denv infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral t cells. coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. is the infection of fc-γ-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to covid-19 disease severity? studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. for denv, the most compelling evidence for a role of ade in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans. a second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccine. enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a th2-directed t cell response (ruckwardt et al., 2019ruckwardt t.j. morabito k.m. graham b.s. immunological lessons from respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development.immunity. 2019; 51: 429-442abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (66) google scholar). immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. while preclinical studies of multiple sars-cov vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (bolles et al., 2011bolles m. deming d. long k. agnihothram s. whitmore a. ferris m. funkhouser w. gralinski l. totura a. heise m. baric r.s. a double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge.j. virol. 2011; 85: 12201-12215crossref pubmed scopus (354) google scholar). the structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. based on recent progress in rsv vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion s epitopes together with a th1 t cell response may be key features of a safe sars-cov-2 vaccine. the development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. this traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like sars-cov-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. however, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate sars-cov-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. in this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of sars-cov-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.",2020,"2023-07-03 03:14:45","2023-07-03 03:14:45",NA,"699–703",NA,5,27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: Cell Press Type: journal-article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"the challenges of vaccine development against a new virus during a pandemic the rapid emergence of a highly pathogenic, readily transmissible coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, affecting millions and destabilizing economies. this catastrophe triggered a clarion call for the immediate deployment of a protective vaccine. we describe the unique challenges of developing a vaccine against sars-cov-2 in a pandemic setting. the rapid emergence of a highly pathogenic, readily transmissible coronavirus has resulted in a global pandemic, affecting millions and destabilizing economies. this catastrophe triggered a clarion call for the immediate deployment of a protective vaccine. we describe the unique challenges of developing a vaccine against sars-cov-2 in a pandemic setting. historically, human coronaviruses have received limited attention from the research and medical communities. although infections by human coronaviruses (e.g., hcov-229e and hcov-oc43) frequently cause common cold symptoms in healthy individuals, severe clinical illness is relatively rare even in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and the elderly. considerably more has been known about animal coronaviruses, leading to vaccines to prevent the infection of commercially important domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, and cattle). experiments over many years with murine hepatitis virus (mhv), a neurotropic and hepatotropic coronavirus, have provided substantial insight into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and central nervous diseases, including multiple sclerosis. while these studies enhanced our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, only the recent explosive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans has sparked intense interest in developing countermeasures for human viruses in this family. in 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (sars-cov) virus emerged from bats and possibly civet cats in china. within eight months, sars-cov spread to 27 countries around the world, resulting in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (de wit et al., 2016de wit e. van doremalen n. falzarano d. munster v.j. sars and mers: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). an unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organizations, limited transmission and human disease. ten years later, a second coronavirus, the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (mers-cov), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. as observed with sars-cov, mers-cov spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the arabian peninsula (∼2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for mers-cov. since the discovery of sars-cov, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (hcov-nl63 and hcov-hku1) have been discovered. sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (graham et al., 2013graham r.l. donaldson e.f. baric r.s. a decade after sars: strategies for controlling emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2013; 11: 836-848crossref pubmed scopus (493) google scholar). an appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of sars-cov and mers-cov as well as efforts to develop vaccines. in this forum, we discuss how the prior study of sars-cov and mers-cov enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). however, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the fundamental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response. sars-cov-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded rna virus first isolated in wuhan, china, in december of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (zhou et al., 2020zhou p. yang x.l. wang x.g. hu b. zhang l. zhang w. si h.r. zhu y. li b. huang c.l. et al.a pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.nature. 2020; 579: 270-273crossref pubmed scopus (12911) google scholar). sars-cov-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (covid-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (guan et al., 2020guan w.j. ni z.y. hu y. liang w.h. ou c.q. he j.x. liu l. shan h. lei c.l. hui d.s.c. et al.china medical treatment expert group for covid-19clinical characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 in china.n. engl. j. med. 2020; https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa2002032crossref scopus (18405) google scholar). the elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from covid-19. virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in china, italy, spain, germany, france, iran, and the united states and epicenters in large urban cities. most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. sars-cov-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 april 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at ∼4%. the extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. rapid implementation and deployment of an effective sars-cov-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return. coronaviruses are round, ∼120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (s) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. three additional viral structural proteins (envelope [e], membrane [m], and nucleocapsid [n]), together with a lipid membrane and ∼25–31 kilobase viral genome, comprise the virion (figure 1a; de wit et al., 2016de wit e. van doremalen n. falzarano d. munster v.j. sars and mers: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). the m and e proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the s protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. interactions between the m glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. the small structural e protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. the nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle. the s protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (de wit et al., 2016de wit e. van doremalen n. falzarano d. munster v.j. sars and mers: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses.nat. rev. microbiol. 2016; 14: 523-534crossref pubmed scopus (2221) google scholar). in some circumstances, the s protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. the s protein is a class i viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [ha], hiv-1 [gp160], and ebola [glycoprotein, gp]). this class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. accordingly, the sars-cov and sars-cov-2 s proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield s1 and s2 fragments, followed by further processing of s2 to yield a smaller s2′ protein. cleavage also may occur during viral egress. the s1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (rbd), whereas the carboxyl terminal s2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. the structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the sars-cov-2 s protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5å using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the sars-cov s protein (figure 1b; wrapp et al., 2020wrapp d. wang n. corbett k.s. goldsmith j.a. hsieh c.l. abiona o. graham b.s. mclellan j.s. cryo-em structure of the 2019-ncov spike in the prefusion conformation.science. 2020; 367: 1260-1263crossref pubmed scopus (82) google scholar). both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the rbd. the application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. for example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for zika virus (zikv) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. several vaccine strategies against sars-cov and mers-cov, many focused on the s protein, have been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (zhou et al., 2018zhou y. jiang s. du l. prospects for a mers-cov spike vaccine.expert rev. vaccines. 2018; 17: 677-686crossref pubmed scopus (98) google scholar). although multiple platforms of sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine candidates were evaluated in human trials (e.g., viral vectored [nct03615911 and nct04170829], dna plasmid [nct00099463], and inactivated virus [nct00533741]), none advanced beyond phase 1 safety studies. similarly, no vaccines have been developed against other human coronaviruses. within months of publication of the sars-cov-2 genome sequence, work began on dozens of vaccine candidates (https://www.who.int/blueprint/priority-diseases/key-action/novel-coronavirus-landscape-ncov.pdf?ua=1), enabled by insights from the sars-cov and mers-cov vaccine development and well-characterized vaccine antigen expression platforms, including those shown to be safe in humans. several vaccines, described below, have entered phase 1 clinical trials to evaluate safety in small numbers of subjects (table 1). however, given the lack of established and tractable pre-clinical disease models of sars-cov-2 pathogenesis, these vaccines have advanced to human trials without data in animals establishing efficacy against covid-19.table 1vaccine candidates in development against sars-cov-2vaccine typeplatformprotein targetstageclinical trial designationcompany or institutionvaccine namestatusmrnalipid-encapsulated mrnasphase 1nct04283461 (45 subjects)modernamrna-1273recruitingdnadna plasmidsphase 1nct04336410 (40 subjects)inovio pharmaceuticalsino-4800recruitinghuman adenovirus (ad5)viral-vectoredsphase 1nct04313127 (108 subjects)cansino biologicsad5-ncovactivechimpanzee adenovirusviral-vectoredsphase 1/2nct04324606 (510 subjects)university of oxfordchadox1 ncov-19planned (4/20)spike proteinbacterially produced soluble protein (oral)sphase 1nct04334980 (84 subjects)symvivo corporationbactrl-spikeplanned (4/30)bcg vaccineimmune stimulatorynonephase 3nct04327206 (4170 subjects)nct04328441 (1000 subjects)murdoch childrens research instituteuniversity medical center, netherlandsbcg vaccinerecruitinginformation adapted from https://clinicaltrials.gov. open table in a new tab information adapted from https://clinicaltrials.gov. modified mrnas are synthetic molecules optimized for high-level and durable protein expression. this technology has shown promise as a vaccine platform for influenza virus (nct03076385 and nct03345043) and in preclinical studies with other infectious disease targets including zikv. developed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid) in collaboration with moderna, mrna-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mrna expressing a prefusion-stabilized s protein. the design of the s protein antigen encoded by mrna-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class i fusion proteins of mers-cov and other coronaviruses (pallesen et al., 2017pallesen j. wang n. corbett k.s. wrapp d. kirchdoerfer r.n. turner h.l. cottrell c.a. becker m.m. wang l. shi w. et al.immunogenicity and structures of a rationally designed prefusion mers-cov spike antigen.proc. natl. acad. sci. usa. 2017;

(nct04313127). multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against covid-19 disease (table 1). bcg is a live-attenuated isolate of mycobacterium bovis delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb). multiple studies in humans and mice suggest bcg administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections (moorlag et al., 2019moorlag s.j.c.f.m. arts r.j.w. van crevel r. netea m.g. non-specific effects of bcg vaccine on viral infections.clin. microbiol. infect. 2019; 25: 1473-1478abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (269) google scholar). the mechanisms of bcg-mediated cross protections may include enhanced th1 and th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or “trained immunity” in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection. despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting, there remain substantive challenges for implementation due, in part, to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts. this approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years (e.g., influenza, dengue [denv], and respiratory syncytial viruses) for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses. while multiple vaccine platforms against sars-cov-2 focus on the s protein, questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response.

the emergence and rapid spread of sars-cov-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity. indeed, a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity. pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to sars-cov-2 infection (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.07.939389), likely because mouse ace2 cannot act as a cellular receptor for sars-cov-2 (letko et al., 2020letko m. marzi a. munster v. functional assessment of cell entry and receptor usage for sars-cov-2 and other lineage b betacoronaviruses.nat. microbiol. 2020; 5: 562-569crossref pubmed scopus (1857) google scholar). transgenic mice that express human ace2 (hace2-tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing. beyond this, pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models (e.g., ferrets and hamsters) still are in early stages of development. safety is the primary consideration of any vaccine development program, given the anticipated administration to large numbers of people. beyond the expected reactogenicity profiles, studies with other distantly and closely related coronaviruses have raised concerns that humoral vaccine responses might potentiate sars-cov-2 infection via immune enhancement mechanisms. immune enhancement might occur via at least two distinct mechanisms, detailed below. antibody-dependent enhancement (ade) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing fc-γ or complement receptors. ade of denv infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of denv or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal denv-immune igg. ade is an obstacle for denv-vaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by denv-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine dengvaxia. through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus s protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (vennema et al., 1990vennema h. de groot r.j. harbour d.a. dalderup m. gruffydd-jones t. horzinek m.c. spaan w.j. early death after feline infectious peritonitis virus challenge due to recombinant vaccinia virus immunization.j. virol. 1990; 64: 1407-1409crossref pubmed google scholar). in cell culture experiments, sars-cov entry and infection were enhanced by some anti-s antibodies through both fc-γ-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms (jaume et al., 2011jaume m. yip m.s. cheung c.y. leung h.l. li p.h. kien f. dutry i. callendret b. escriou n. altmeyer r. et al.anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike antibodies trigger infection of human immune cells via a ph- and cysteine protease-independent fcγr pathway.j. virol. 2011; 85: 10582-10597crossref pubmed scopus (229) google scholar, wan et al., 2020wan y. shang j. sun s. tai w. chen j. geng q. he l. chen y. wu j. shi z. et al.molecular mechanism for antibody-dependent enhancement of coronavirus entry.j. virol. 2020; 94: e02015-19crossref pubmed scopus (449) google scholar). extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ade assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with in vivo outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease in vivo. this may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ade assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. the inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many in vitro assays, reduces enhancement in an igg subclass-dependent manner. ade has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of denv infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral t cells. coronavirus antibodies that enhance in vitro have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. is the infection of fc-γ-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to covid-19 disease severity? studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. for denv, the most compelling evidence for a role of ade in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans. a second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) vaccine. enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a th2-directed t cell response (ruckwardt et al., 2019ruckwardt t.j. morabito k.m. graham b.s. immunological lessons from respiratory syncytial virus vaccine development.immunity. 2019; 51: 429-442abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (66) google scholar). immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. while preclinical studies of multiple sars-cov vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (bolles et al., 2011bolles m. deming d. long k. agnihothram s. whitmore a. ferris m. funkhouser w. gralinski l. totura a. heise m. baric r.s. a double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge.j. virol. 2011; 85: 12201-12215crossref pubmed scopus (354) google scholar). the structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. based on recent progress in rsv vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion s epitopes together with a th1 t cell response may be key features of a safe sars-cov-2 vaccine. the development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. this traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like sars-cov-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. however, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate sars-cov-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. in this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of sars-cov-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future."

359: 91-97crossref pubmed scopus (2817) google scholar). despite growing evidence of a connection between the microbiota and the immune system, its impact on immunity to vaccination remains poorly understood. recent studies have demonstrated a profound impairment in vaccine-induced antibody responses during microbiota perturbation. yet, much of this evidence comes from studies in animal models, such as germ-free mice or mice treated with antibiotics. even though vaccines and antibiotics represent the most widely used and important public health interventions, surprisingly little is known about the interaction between them. in this review, we discuss the impact of the microbiota on vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. this review will primarily focus on gut bacteria, as this is by far the most studied aspect of the microbiota. first, we summarize the known knowns and known unknowns about how the microbiota, which is widely distributed in diverse tissues, can act locally or at distal sites in the body. then, we discuss how vaccine efficacies vary in populations throughout the world and between individuals and consider the ways in which the microbiota could contribute toward this variation. much of the experimental evidence for this comes from studies in mice and correlative studies in humans but establishing causality in humans has been challenging. however, emerging studies using systems vaccinology approaches to study vaccine responses in healthy humans that were given antibiotics are providing causal evidence for the role of the microbiota on human immunity (hagan et al., 2019hagan t. cortese m. rouphael n. boudreau c. linde c. maddur m.s. das j. wang h. guthmiller j. zheng n.y. et al.antibiotics-driven gut microbiome perturbation alters immunity to vaccines in humans.cell. 2019; 178: 1313-1328.e13abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (278) google scholar). we discuss these studies and the mechanistic insights into how the microbiota controls the immune system. we conclude by considering the major challenges that need to be addressed to understand the complex and dynamic interplay between the human microbiota and the host response to vaccines, especially in the very young and the very old, and how this knowledge can be exploited to advance novel vaccines. microbial communities are widely distributed in the gut, lung, skin, and other epithelial surfaces. the microbiota can influence host responses locally at the site, or act at a distance, and exercise profound systemic influence (figure 1a). this, in turn, could potentially impact immune responses to vaccination. the mechanisms by which the microbiota exerts local or systemic effects are considered below. the alimentary canal presents a very diverse set of niches for colonization by the microbiota. local interaction with the immune system primarily occurs in the small and large intestines, which harbor large numbers of b and t cells as well as antigen-presenting cells. these cells can detect many of the biomolecules produced by the microbiota, including short-chain fatty acids (scfas) (macia et al., 2015macia l. tan j. vieira a.t. leach k. stanley d. luong s. maruya m. ian mckenzie c. hijikata a. wong c. et al.metabolite-sensing receptors gpr43 and gpr109a facilitate dietary fibre-induced gut homeostasis through regulation of the inflammasome.nat. commun. 2015;

210: 2465-2476crossref pubmed scopus (80) google scholar). some of these compounds are passively or actively transported across the epithelial lining of the gut and can be detected and acted upon by immune cells in the lamina propria. antigen-specific immunity is generated by dendritic cells that continuously sample the intestinal lumen (macpherson and uhr, 2004macpherson a.j. uhr t. induction of protective iga by intestinal dendritic cells carrying commensal bacteria.science. 2004; 303: 1662-1665crossref pubmed scopus (1188) google scholar), and even simple bacterial cell adhesion to the gut epithelium has the potential to modulate the immune system (atarashi et al., 2015atarashi k. tanoue t. ando m. kamada n. nagano y. narushima s. suda w. imaoka a. setoyama h. nagamori t. et al.th17 cell induction by adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells.cell. 2015; 163: 367-380abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (684) google scholar). naturally, the responses to such stimuli are context dependent and have the potential to elicit complex changes in the gut immune system. imprinting of the gut immune system by the microbiota might also affect its capabilities to respond to pathogens. the most commonly administered oral vaccines are live-attenuated versions of microorganisms that replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, such as polio, cholera, typhoid fever, and rotavirus. understanding the local interplay between gut microbiota and the immune system is vital to improve the efficacy of oral vaccines. oral and systemic antibiotics can also have a profound effect on the gut microbiome and therefore potentially on responsiveness to (oral) vaccines. consistent with this idea, low microbiota diversity early in life has been associated with differences in immune phenotype (olin et al., 2018olin a. henckel e. chen y. lakshmikanth t. pou c. mikes j. gustafsson a. bernhardsson a.k. zhang c. bohlin k. brodin p. stereotypic immune system development in newborn children.cell. 2018;

176: 982-997.e16abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (122) google scholar). identifying specific signals has been difficult, but the secretomes of staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus provoked opposing effects on immune activation, indicating phylum-specific effects (laborel-preneron et al., 2015laborel-preneron e. bianchi p. boralevi f. lehours p. fraysse f. morice-picard f. sugai m. sato'o y. badiou c. lina g. et al.effects of the staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis secretomes isolated from the skin microbiota of atopic children on cd4+ t cell activation.plos one. 2015; 10: e0141067pubmed google scholar). lipopeptides binding the toll-like receptor-2/6 (tlr-2/6) heterodimer have also shown to be immunosuppressive in this context (skabytska et al., 2014skabytska y. wölbing f. günther c. köberle m. kaesler s. chen k.m. guenova e. demircioglu d. kempf w.e. volz t. et al.cutaneous innate immune sensing of toll-like receptor 2–6 ligands suppresses t cell immunity by inducing myeloid-derived suppressor cells.immunity. 2014;

363: 227-228crossref pubmed scopus (69) google scholar) and could potentially impact immunity to vaccination. while the lungs were long believed to be sterile, sequencing-based methods and new techniques of bacterial cell culture have revealed that the luminal surface harbors a microbiota, albeit a less diverse one than that of the gut (dickson et al., 2016dickson r.p. erb-downward j.r. martinez f.j. huffnagle g.b. the microbiome and the respiratory tract.annu. rev. physiol. 2016; 78: 481-504crossref pubmed scopus (485) google scholar). so far, the live-attenuated influenza vaccine is the only vaccine administered through the intranasal route. however, several vaccines for respiratory pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) are being developed (world health organization, 2020world health organizationdraft landscape of covid-19 candidate vaccines.https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccinesdate: 2020google scholar), and will require the appropriate quality and quantity of mucosal antibody response, and t cell response in the lung, to be effective. these mucosal responses could conceivably be influenced by the lung microbiota. for example, plasma cells and tissue-resident memory t cells (trms) in the lung may derive signals from lung bacterial products that enhance their survival and/or function. in this context, our recent study demonstrates that trms in the vaginal tissues provide signals to neighboring cells, including myeloid cells, to enhance antiviral responses in such cells (arunachalam et al., 2020arunachalam p.s. charles t.p. joag v. bollimpelli v.s. scott m.k.d. wimmers f. burton s.l. labranche c.c. petitdemange c. gangadhara s. et al.t cell-inducing vaccine durably prevents mucosal shiv infection even with lower neutralizing antibody titers.nat. med. 2020; 26: 932-940crossref pubmed scopus (76) google scholar). the extent to which the local microbiota could impinge on such trm-innate interactions and whether such interactions are pervasive in other tissues remain to be seen. in addition to affecting their local milieu, microbes can also influence immune reactions in anatomical locations distal from the site of colonization. this can conceivably happen through several mechanisms (figure 1b): (1) translocation of bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from mucosal sites to the systemic circulation (sandler and douek, 2012sandler n.g. douek d.c. microbial translocation in hiv infection: causes, consequences and treatment opportunities.nat. rev. microbiol. 2012; 10: 655-666crossref pubmed scopus (318) google scholar), (2) a “domino effect” mechanism, where signals from the microbiota are delivered to cells in the vicinity, which then circulate throughout the body and relay this information (perhaps through cytokines, metabolites, or other molecules), and (3) via dissemination of microbiota-derived metabolites (metabolite second messenger model). consistent with this idea, microbiota-derived metabolites can be identified in various tissues and, thus, have the potential to be detected by the immune system at those sites (uchimura et al., 2018uchimura y. fuhrer t. li h. lawson m.a. zimmermann m. yilmaz b. zindel j. ronchi f. sorribas m. hapfelmeier s. et al.antibodies set boundaries limiting microbial metabolite penetration and the resultant mammalian host response.immunity. 2018;

44: 647-658abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (232) google scholar). another fascinating example of how the microbiota could act globally comes from recent studies that suggest that the response to hiv, and perhaps other viruses, could be imprinted by prior exposure to antigenically cross-reactive microbiota-derived antigens (williams et al., 2018williams w.b. han q. haynes b.f. cross-reactivity of hiv vaccine responses and the microbiome.curr. opin. hiv aids. 2018; 13: 9-14crossref pubmed scopus (20) google scholar). haynes and colleagues showed that hiv vaccine-induced cd4+ t and b cell responses could originate from a pool of intestinal cross-reactive immune cells. when they examined anti-hiv responses in ileum b cells and probed their relationship to commensal bacteria, remarkably, a majority (82%) of the ileum hiv anti-gp41 antibodies cross-reacted with commensal bacteria, and of those, 43% showed non-hiv-1 antigen polyreactivity (trama et al., 2014trama a.m. moody m.a. alam s.m. jaeger f.h. lockwood b. parks r. lloyd k.e. stolarchuk c. scearce r. foulger a. et al.hiv-1 envelope gp41 antibodies can originate from terminal ileum b cells that share cross-reactivity with commensal bacteria.cell host microbe. 2014;

178: 1313-1328.e13abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (278) google scholar). we discuss these studies and the mechanistic insights into how the microbiota controls the immune system. we conclude by considering the major challenges that need to be addressed to understand the complex and dynamic interplay between the human microbiota and the host response to vaccines, especially in the very young and the very old, and how this knowledge can be exploited to advance novel vaccines. microbial communities are widely distributed in the gut, lung, skin, and other epithelial surfaces. the microbiota can influence host responses locally at the site, or act at a distance, and exercise profound systemic influence (figure 1a). this, in turn, could potentially impact immune responses to vaccination. the mechanisms by which the microbiota exerts local or systemic effects are considered below. the alimentary canal presents a very diverse set of niches for colonization by the microbiota. local interaction with the immune system primarily occurs in the small and large intestines, which harbor large numbers of b and t cells as well as antigen-presenting cells. these cells can detect many of the biomolecules produced by the microbiota, including short-chain fatty acids (scfas) (macia et al., 2015macia l. tan j. vieira a.t. leach k. stanley d. luong s. maruya m. ian mckenzie c. hijikata a. wong c. et al.metabolite-sensing receptors gpr43 and gpr109a facilitate dietary fibre-induced gut homeostasis through regulation of the inflammasome.nat. commun. 2015;

303: 1662-1665crossref pubmed scopus (1188) google scholar), and even simple bacterial cell adhesion to the gut epithelium has the potential to modulate the immune system (atarashi et al., 2015atarashi k. tanoue t. ando m. kamada n. nagano y. narushima s. suda w. imaoka a. setoyama h. nagamori t. et al.th17 cell induction by adhesion of microbes to intestinal epithelial cells.cell. 2015;

363: 227-228crossref pubmed scopus (69) google scholar) and could potentially impact immunity to vaccination. while the lungs were long believed to be sterile, sequencing-based methods and new techniques of bacterial cell culture have revealed that the luminal surface harbors a microbiota, albeit a less diverse one than that of the gut (dickson et al., 2016dickson r.p. erb-downward j.r. martinez f.j. huffnagle g.b. the microbiome and the respiratory tract.annu. rev. physiol. 2016;

10: 655-666crossref pubmed scopus (318) google scholar), (2) a “domino effect” mechanism, where signals from the microbiota are delivered to cells in the vicinity, which then circulate throughout the body and relay this information (perhaps through cytokines, metabolites, or other molecules), and (3) via dissemination of microbiota-derived metabolites (metabolite second messenger model). consistent with this idea, microbiota-derived metabolites can be identified in various tissues and, thus, have the potential to be detected by the immune system at those sites (uchimura et al., 2018uchimura y. fuhrer t. li h. lawson m.a. zimmermann m. yilmaz b. zindel j. ronchi f. sorribas m. hapfelmeier s. et al.antibodies set boundaries limiting microbial metabolite penetration and the resultant mammalian host response.immunity. 2018;

44: 647-658abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (232) google scholar). another fascinating example of how the microbiota could act globally comes from recent studies that suggest that the response to hiv, and perhaps other viruses, could be imprinted by prior exposure to antigenically cross-reactive microbiota-derived antigens (williams et al., 2018williams w.b. han q. haynes b.f. cross-reactivity of hiv vaccine responses and the microbiome.curr. opin. hiv aids. 2018; 13: 9-14crossref pubmed scopus (20) google scholar). haynes and colleagues showed that hiv vaccine-induced cd4+ t and b cell responses could originate from a pool of intestinal cross-reactive immune cells. when they examined anti-hiv responses in ileum b cells and probed their relationship to commensal bacteria, remarkably, a majority (82%) of the ileum hiv anti-gp41 antibodies cross-reacted with commensal bacteria, and of those, 43% showed non-hiv-1 antigen polyreactivity (trama et al., 2014trama a.m. moody m.a. alam s.m. jaeger f.h. lockwood b. parks r. lloyd k.e. stolarchuk c. scearce r. foulger a. et al.hiv-1 envelope gp41 antibodies can originate from terminal ileum b cells that share cross-reactivity with commensal bacteria.cell host microbe. 2014;

370: 20140144crossref pubmed scopus (46) google scholar). for example, the magnitude of hemagglutinin inhibition titers induced by vaccination with the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine can vary by more than 100-fold between individuals in a single cohort (nakaya et al., 2015nakaya h.i. hagan t. duraisingham s.s. lee e.k. kwissa m. rouphael n. frasca d. gersten m. mehta a.k. gaujoux r. et al.systems analysis of immunity to influenza vaccination across multiple years and in diverse populations reveals shared molecular signatures.immunity. 2015;

30 (39%) indications were recommended for reimbursement from the allocated budget expansion and a further 12 indications (15.5%), which were alternatives to previously approved medications, were recommended for reimbursement but without added cost to the overall budget (table a2). treatments with curative intent were given the highest priority. most submissions for potentially curative intent were recommended for funding (6 of 8, 75%), compared with only 36 of 69 (52%) indications for non-curative treatment. with one exception, the therapies with curative potential that were incorporated in the ranking achieved an esmo-mcbs score of a. the thirty interventions recommended for reimbursement from the allocated budget expansion were ranked for prioritization. five adjuvant treatments with curative intent were ranked above treatments with non-curative intent. with three exceptions, all non-curative indications in the top 30 list were scored by the esmo-mcbs v1.1 as three or above. the exceptions were: (i) olaparib as maintenance therapy for brca-mutated, unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer (esmo-mcbs v1.1 score 2) was ranked 20/30, because it delayed the need for further chemotherapy which the iscort gi-group members considered as a patient benefit not captured by the polo study design endpoints; (ii) ipilimumab and nivolumab after progression on a single agent ici in advanced melanoma (esmo-mcbs v1.1 not scorable) was ranked lowly (24/30). it was strongly endorsed by the melanoma specialty group since it is a common off-label clinical practice, though it is not yet supported by any prospective randomized study and (iii) the study supporting the indication of pembrolizumab for patients with bcg-unresponsive high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer15balar a.v. kamat a.m. kulkarni g.s. et al.pembrolizumab monotherapy for the treatment of high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer unresponsive to bcg (keynote-057): an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study.lancet oncol. 2021;

21: 671-684google scholar evidence for benefit for these indications was derived from single-arm studies with surrogate outcomes of overall response rate and duration of survival. the steering committee considered the rarity of certain driver mutations impacting the feasibility of conducting large registration trials, and accordingly ranked drugs with high response rate and durable response in this setting above what would be dictated by the esmo-mcbs score. to enhance the value and contain the total budget impact and thus allow inclusion of more drugs, the committee members recommended narrowing some of the indications requested by the sponsors (table a1). some of these recommendations were inferred from the indirect comparisons of clinical trials, planned and post hoc subgroup analyses and biological understanding of mechanisms of actions. thus, the final list recommended that coverage for the use of icis in urothelial, esophageal and gastric cancers should be restricted to programmed death-ligand 1-positive tumors only. the 12 indications for which reimbursement decisions did not require additional budget allocation (table a2) were all for indications where there was little or no added marginal benefit compared with other agents already fully covered by the national insurance scheme, but where listing of an alternative may have a positive economic impact by the introduction of competitive pricing. since equally effective therapies were already covered by the national insurance scheme, these 12 indications were not ranked for added clinical benefit. unlike other countries (e.g. australia, germany, austria, france, canada, hungary and uk), where submissions are considered on an ad hoc basis, the hta process in israel is an annual process whereby all new candidate technologies are considered simultaneously and competitively for funding from constrained budget expansion. since the annual health basket evaluation mechanism allows only one opportunity for drugs to be reimbursed each year, the ranking process presented here is, to our knowledge, the only annual formal national ranking of all new cancer drugs. ultimately, this process is not the final determinate. the list and the considerations underlying its development will be presented to the central hta committee where all the data are reviewed and where value, cost and total budget impact of each indication are additional considerations in the determination of the new therapies to be included in the “free for user” basket of services. this very hands-on experience highlights many of the difficulties challenging hta processes globally, illustrates the value of incorporating the esmo-mcbs as part of the process, but also points to the limitations of data objectification where uncertainty regarding the veracity and generalizability of the available data is high. among the non-curative therapies in addition to the esmo-mcbs score, clinical experience from the perspective of the members of the relevant subspecialty faculty groups was also influential.",2022,"2023-07-03 03:14:31","2023-07-03 03:14:31",NA,"100379–100379",NA,1,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: BMJ Type: journal-article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"implementation of the esmo-magnitude of clinical benefit scale: real world example from the 2022 israeli national reimbursement process in recent years there has been a surge in the number of new medications for the treatment of cancer.1xin yu j. hubbard-lucey v.m. tang j. immuno-oncology drug development goes global.nat rev drug discov. 2019;

21: 671-684google scholar evidence for benefit for these indications was derived from single-arm studies with surrogate outcomes of overall response rate and duration of survival. the steering committee considered the rarity of certain driver mutations impacting the feasibility of conducting large registration trials, and accordingly ranked drugs with high response rate and durable response in this setting above what would be dictated by the esmo-mcbs score. to enhance the value and contain the total budget impact and thus allow inclusion of more drugs, the committee members recommended narrowing some of the indications requested by the sponsors (table a1). some of these recommendations were inferred from the indirect comparisons of clinical trials, planned and post hoc subgroup analyses and biological understanding of mechanisms of actions. thus, the final list recommended that coverage for the use of icis in urothelial, esophageal and gastric cancers should be restricted to programmed death-ligand 1-positive tumors only. the 12 indications for which reimbursement decisions did not require additional budget allocation (table a2) were all for indications where there was little or no added marginal benefit compared with other agents already fully covered by the national insurance scheme, but where listing of an alternative may have a positive economic impact by the introduction of competitive pricing. since equally effective therapies were already covered by the national insurance scheme, these 12 indications were not ranked for added clinical benefit. unlike other countries (e.g. australia, germany, austria, france, canada, hungary and uk), where submissions are considered on an ad hoc basis, the hta process in israel is an annual process whereby all new candidate technologies are considered simultaneously and competitively for funding from constrained budget expansion. since the annual health basket evaluation mechanism allows only one opportunity for drugs to be reimbursed each year, the ranking process presented here is, to our knowledge, the only annual formal national ranking of all new cancer drugs. ultimately, this process is not the final determinate. the list and the considerations underlying its development will be presented to the central hta committee where all the data are reviewed and where value, cost and total budget impact of each indication are additional considerations in the determination of the new therapies to be included in the “free for user” basket of services. this very hands-on experience highlights many of the difficulties challenging hta processes globally, illustrates the value of incorporating the esmo-mcbs as part of the process, but also points to the limitations of data objectification where uncertainty regarding the veracity and generalizability of the available data is high. among the non-curative therapies in addition to the esmo-mcbs score, clinical experience from the perspective of the members of the relevant subspecialty faculty groups was also influential."

hypothesized that hkmm may also induce trained immunity and show an improved safety profile with respect to bcg and may therefore have the capacity to contribute to the management of the covid-19 pandemic. here we addressed whether hkmm induces trained immunity in vitro and in vivo and assessed the impact of oral uptake of nr on sars-cov-2 infection and the course of covid-19 disease (namely, incidence, severity, and absenteeism caused by the disease) in a cohort of highly exposed hcws in spain. the human monocytic thp-1 cell line has been widely used to model the function and regulation of human primary macrophages. here we sought to establish a protocol of trained immunity in the thp-1 cell line using heat-killed bcg (hkbcg) and test whether hkmm was also capable of inducing an equivalent response. to this end, we examined two hallmarks of trained immunity, namely enhanced inflammatory secretion and shift of macrophage metabolism toward glycolysis. the standardized protocol is shown in figure 1a. initial priming of the macrophages with hkbcg or hkmm led to higher tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β expression than in untrained cells when they were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (lps) as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313, figure 1b). likewise, higher levels of tnf-α and il-1β were observed when cells were challenged with heat-killed staphylococcus aureus (hk s. aureus) and inactivated (in) sars-cov-2, respectively (p = 0.0313, figures 1c and 1d). in contrast, no differences were detected in il-6 or il-1β production when cells were rechallenged with hks. aureus, in tnf-α or il-6 production when cells were rechallenged with insars-cov-2, or in tnf-α, il-6, or il-1β production after cells were stimulated with heat-killed m. tuberculosis (hkmtb) and in swine influenza virus (siv) h1n1 (data not shown). regarding metabolic activity, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained thp-1 cells showed increased levels of l(+)-lactate (p = 0.0313, figure 1e), although at this time point no differences in the expression of glycolytic enzymes were detected (figure s1a). taken together, these results suggest that hkmm induces trained immunity in vitro in thp-1 cells to the same extent as hkbcg. furthermore, it is remarkable that when analyzing cell size, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained thp-1 cells appeared to be larger than untrained cells (p = 0.0152 and p = 0.0087, respectively figure s1b)—an effect that was previously observed for β-glucan and bcg training.38bekkering s. blok b.a. joosten l.a.b. riksen n.p. van crevel r. netea m.g. in vitro experimental model of trained innate

vitro in the monocyte-like thp-1 cell line, we tested whether it could also induce trained immunity in primary monocytes. like hkbcg training, hkmm enhanced tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β production as compared to the control when monocytes were exposed to lps (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0156, respectively, figure 2a) and hks. aureus (p = 0.0313, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0078, respectively, figure 2b) as inflammatory stimuli. in addition, hkmm-trained monocytes showed greater tnf-α and il-6 production when challenged with hkmtb as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313 and p = 0.0078, figure 2c). however, stimulation with insars-cov-2 and insiv h1n1 had no effect on tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β production after the initial priming with hkbcg or hkmm (figures 2d and 2e). hkmm-trained primary monocytes rechallenged with lps, hkmtb, and insars-cov-2 showed an increase in the production of il-10, although this increase was not significant (figures 2a–2e). regarding il-1ra, no differences were detected in its production by either hkbcg- or hkmm-trained primary monocytes (figures 2a–2e). with respect to metabolic activity, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained human monocytes increased l(+)-lactate production (p = 0.0156, figure 2f). taken together, these results indicate that hkmm induces trained immunity in human primary monocytes in vitro by boosting metabolic functions and inflammatory responses against lps, hks. aureus, and hkmtb. next, we analyzed the epigenetic marks of tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β gene promoters, which have been proposed as key elements mediating long-term enhanced responses in trained immunity with bcg.39bekkering s. domínguez-andrés j. joosten l.a.b. riksen n.p. netea m.g. trained immunity: reprogramming innate immunity in health and disease.annu. rev. immunol. 2021; 39: 667-693crossref pubmed scopus (81) google scholar we applied chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) to study the histone modifications associated with open/active chromatin, such as trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 (h3k4me3) and acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 (h3k27ac). increased h3k4me3 and h3k27ac levels were found in the promoter regions of tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β in primary monocytes trained with hkmm (figures 3a and 3b , respectively). these observations suggest that chromatin is more active in the promoter regions of proinflammatory genes, thus leading to an increased expression and responsiveness to secondary stimuli. moreover, h3k4me3 and h3k27ac levels were highly correlated for the il-1β gene promoter (p value = 0.0083, ρ = 0.8333, figure 3c), thus emphasizing the role of il-1β in trained immunity. overall, these results suggest that in vitro training with hkmm increases h3k4me3 and h3k27ac at the promoter sites of proinflammatory genes. the manrecovid19 clinical trial included 317 participants, of which 214 were in the nr group and 103 in the placebo group. the demographics and baseline characteristics of the participants are described in table 1, and the professional categories of the hcws who participated in the study are described in table s2. a full description of participants is given in the flowchart in figure 4. the main variable to assess efficacy was the cumulative incidence of documented sars-cov-2 infection, as determined by rt-pcr, rapid antigenic test (rat), or serological blood test. the study procedures and variables collected at each visit are listed in table s3. all participants who met inclusion criteria were studied as “intention to treat” (itt) population. the “per protocol” (pp) population was composed of those participants with a confirmed negative result in the sars-cov-2 test before the start of the study who completed the final study visit without significant deviations from the protocol and had not received a covid-19 vaccine before the end of the study. in the itt population, 62 (19.6%) of the tests conducted were positive (table s4), while 21 (10.6%) were positive in the pp population (table s5). we found no significant differences in the positivity of the tests between the two treatment groups. tables s6 and s7 show the type of tests conducted and the vaccinations of the itt and the pp populations, respectively. the cumulative incidence of sars-cov-2 infection did not differ between the two treatment arms for the itt population (figure 5a), as shown in the logistic regression model (odds ratio [or] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.64–2.35) (table s6). women had a lower incidence of infection than men (or 0.96, 95% ci 0.94–0.99). a higher number of comorbidities were associated with a higher incidence of infection (or 1.54, 95% ci 1.05–2.25). previous vaccination (seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine) was also associated with a higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection (or 7.04, 95% ci 3.11–15.93). receiving a comedication at baseline was associated with a lower incidence of infection (or 0.25, 95% ci 0.1–0.6). the rest of the variables showed no statistical significance. for the pp sample, we did not find differences in the incidence of sars-cov-2 infection between the nr and placebo groups (figure 5b) (or 2.03, 95% ci 0.62–6.67, table s7). women had a lower incidence of infection than men (or 0.27, 95% ci 0.09–0.77). a higher bmi and previous seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine were associated with a higher risk of

hypothesized that hkmm may also induce trained immunity and show an improved safety profile with respect to bcg and may therefore have the capacity to contribute to the management of the covid-19 pandemic. here we addressed whether hkmm induces trained immunity in vitro and in vivo and assessed the impact of oral uptake of nr on sars-cov-2 infection and the course of covid-19 disease (namely, incidence, severity, and absenteeism caused by the disease) in a cohort of highly exposed hcws in spain. the human monocytic thp-1 cell line has been widely used to model the function and regulation of human primary macrophages. here we sought to establish a protocol of trained immunity in the thp-1 cell line using heat-killed bcg (hkbcg) and test whether hkmm was also capable of inducing an equivalent response. to this end, we examined two hallmarks of trained immunity, namely enhanced inflammatory secretion and shift of macrophage metabolism toward glycolysis. the standardized protocol is shown in figure 1a. initial priming of the macrophages with hkbcg or hkmm led to higher tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β expression than in untrained cells when they were exposed to lipopolysaccharides (lps) as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313, figure 1b). likewise, higher levels of tnf-α and il-1β were observed when cells were challenged with heat-killed staphylococcus aureus (hk s. aureus) and inactivated (in) sars-cov-2, respectively (p = 0.0313, figures 1c and 1d). in contrast, no differences were detected in il-6 or il-1β production when cells were rechallenged with hks. aureus, in tnf-α or il-6 production when cells were rechallenged with insars-cov-2, or in tnf-α, il-6, or il-1β production after cells were stimulated with heat-killed m. tuberculosis (hkmtb) and in swine influenza virus (siv) h1n1 (data not shown). regarding metabolic activity, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained thp-1 cells showed increased levels of l(+)-lactate (p = 0.0313, figure 1e), although at this time point no differences in the expression of glycolytic enzymes were detected (figure s1a). taken together, these results suggest that hkmm induces trained immunity in vitro in thp-1 cells to the same extent as hkbcg. furthermore, it is remarkable that when analyzing cell size, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained thp-1 cells appeared to be larger than untrained cells (p = 0.0152 and p = 0.0087, respectively figure

vitro in the monocyte-like thp-1 cell line, we tested whether it could also induce trained immunity in primary monocytes. like hkbcg training, hkmm enhanced tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β production as compared to the control when monocytes were exposed to lps (p = 0.001, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0156, respectively, figure 2a) and hks. aureus (p = 0.0313, p = 0.001, and p = 0.0078, respectively, figure 2b) as inflammatory stimuli. in addition, hkmm-trained monocytes showed greater tnf-α and il-6 production when challenged with hkmtb as secondary stimulus (p = 0.0313 and p = 0.0078, figure 2c). however, stimulation with insars-cov-2 and insiv h1n1 had no effect on tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β production after the initial priming with hkbcg or hkmm (figures 2d and 2e). hkmm-trained primary monocytes rechallenged with lps, hkmtb, and insars-cov-2 showed an increase in the production of il-10, although this increase was not significant (figures 2a–2e). regarding il-1ra, no differences were detected in its production by either hkbcg- or hkmm-trained primary monocytes (figures 2a–2e). with respect to metabolic activity, hkbcg- and hkmm-trained human monocytes increased l(+)-lactate production (p = 0.0156, figure 2f). taken together, these results indicate that hkmm induces trained immunity in human primary monocytes in vitro by boosting metabolic functions and inflammatory responses against lps, hks. aureus, and hkmtb. next, we analyzed the epigenetic marks of tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β gene promoters, which have been proposed as key elements mediating long-term enhanced responses in trained immunity with bcg.39bekkering s. domínguez-andrés j. joosten l.a.b. riksen n.p. netea m.g. trained immunity: reprogramming innate immunity in health and disease.annu. rev. immunol. 2021; 39: 667-693crossref pubmed scopus (81) google scholar we applied chromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) to study the histone modifications associated with open/active chromatin, such as trimethylation of histone h3 at lysine 4 (h3k4me3) and acetylation of histone h3 at lysine 27 (h3k27ac). increased h3k4me3 and h3k27ac levels were found in the promoter regions of tnf-α, il-6, and il-1β in primary monocytes trained with hkmm (figures 3a and 3b , respectively). these observations suggest that chromatin is more active in the promoter regions of proinflammatory genes, thus leading to an increased expression and responsiveness to secondary stimuli. moreover, h3k4me3 and h3k27ac levels were highly correlated for the il-1β gene promoter (p value = 0.0083, ρ = 0.8333, figure 3c), thus emphasizing the role of il-1β in trained immunity. overall, these results suggest that in vitro training with hkmm increases h3k4me3 and h3k27ac at the promoter sites of proinflammatory genes. the manrecovid19 clinical trial included 317 participants, of which 214 were in the nr group and 103 in the placebo group. the demographics and baseline characteristics of the participants are described in table 1, and the professional categories of the hcws who participated in the study are described in table s2. a full description of participants is given in the flowchart in figure 4. the main variable to assess efficacy was the cumulative incidence of documented sars-cov-2 infection, as determined by rt-pcr, rapid antigenic test (rat), or serological blood test. the study procedures and variables collected at each visit are listed in table s3. all participants who met inclusion criteria were studied as “intention to treat” (itt) population. the “per protocol” (pp) population was composed of those participants with a confirmed negative result in the sars-cov-2 test before the start of the study who completed the final study visit without significant deviations from the protocol and had not received a covid-19 vaccine before the end of the study. in the itt population, 62 (19.6%) of the tests conducted were positive (table s4), while 21 (10.6%) were positive in the pp population (table s5). we found no significant differences in the positivity of the tests between the two treatment groups. tables s6 and s7 show the type of tests conducted and the vaccinations of the itt and the pp populations, respectively. the cumulative incidence of sars-cov-2 infection did not differ between the two treatment arms for the itt population (figure 5a), as shown in the logistic regression model (odds ratio [or] 1.22, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.64–2.35) (table s6). women had a lower incidence of infection than men (or 0.96, 95% ci 0.94–0.99). a higher number of comorbidities were associated with a higher incidence of infection (or 1.54, 95% ci 1.05–2.25). previous vaccination (seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine) was also associated with a higher risk of sars-cov-2 infection (or 7.04, 95% ci 3.11–15.93). receiving a comedication at baseline was associated with a lower incidence of infection (or 0.25, 95% ci 0.1–0.6). the rest of the variables showed no statistical significance. for the pp sample, we did not find differences in the incidence of sars-cov-2 infection between the nr and placebo groups (figure 5b) (or 2.03, 95% ci 0.62–6.67, table s7). women had a lower incidence of infection than men (or 0.27, 95% ci 0.09–0.77). a higher bmi and previous seasonal influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine were associated with a higher risk of

52: 445-455google scholar wd is known to disrupt the gut barrier and evoke low-grade inflammation, but whether the barrier is repaired and whether low-grade inflammation is resolved after normal chow diet rest has yet to be explored. to tackle this question, we employed a training model by temporary wd exposure followed by 1-week normal chow resolution. to further rule out contributions of microbiota changes to any observed effects we then co-housed the wd-fed mice with control mice that had received with normal chow for a further 3 weeks (figure 1e). mice switched to normal diet gained less weight than those maintained on wd throughout (figure 1f). switching to normal diet also reversed colon shortening (figure 1g). after normal diet “wash-out”, wd exposed mice (hereafter termed trained mice) had comparable body weight and colon length to control untrained mice (figures 1f and 1g). intriguingly, colon cytokines profile revealed markedly higher il10 but lower il17a expression in trained mice (figure 1h), indicating an anti-inflammatory situation. in addition, trained mice revealed an enhanced intestinal barrier function: there were more goblet cells, thicker mucus (figure 1i) and increased expression of il13, core mucus structural components (e.g., muc2, clca1, and ctsz) and tjps (figure 1j) in distal colon compared with untrained mice. the data so far suggest that wd feeding damages the gut barrier, and that subsequent inflammatory response and repair results in potentially enhanced barrier function. to test these concepts, we challenged mice receiving wd or that had been previously trained with transient wd with dss to induce colitis. in a low-dose (1%) dss treatment model (figure 2a), mice maintained on wd showed increased weight loss (figure 2b) and significantly shorter colon (figure 2c) compared to mice receiving normal diet. those results are in accordance with previous in vivo findings7lee j.y. cevallos s.a. byndloss m.x. tiffany c.r. olsan e.e. butler b.p. young b.m. rogers a.w.l. nguyen h. kim k. et al.high-fat diet and antibiotics cooperatively impair mitochondrial bioenergetics to trigger dysbiosis that exacerbates pre-inflammatory bowel disease.cell host microbe. 2020;

6: 100171google scholar we next tested the response of trained mice to a dose of dss that induces frank inflammation and weight loss in normal diet fed mice (2% dss) (figure 2d). in agreement with markers for better gut barrier function and reduced inflammation, mice that received transient wd training showed less body mass loss (figure 2e) and longer colons (figure 2f). histological analysis of distal colon confirmed reduced epithelium damage (figure 2g) and lower histologic score (figure 2h) after dss treatment in trained mice. furthermore, colon from those trained mice exhibited lower il17a, il10, tnfa, il1b, il6 and cd206 expression (figure 2i). barrier related genes expression, especially goblet cell-specific genes (e.g., muc2, agr2 and spdef), were relatively high at mrna level in dss treated untrained mice (figure 2j), which may suggest a compensatory mechanism for destruction. these data support the conclusion that consumption of wd causes inflammation and barrier dysfunction that can be repaired on return to a healthier normal diet, and in fact this transient diet-driven inflammatory response provides future benefits to gut health by increasing resistance to injury-driven colitis. exacerbation of colitis severity by wd consumption has been reported in other colitis models.20an j. zhao x. wang y. noriega j. gewirtz a.t. zou j. western-style diet impedes colonization and clearance of citrobacter rodentium.plos pathog. 2021;

5: 18google scholar wd resulted in a substantial reduction in microbiota alpha diversity by rank abundance curve (figure 4a) and simpson and shannon diversity index (figures 4b and s3e), but no significant difference was found among chow diet, untrained and trained mice on alpha diversity. based on weighted unifrac distance, minimal difference was found between trained and untrained mice whereas wd mice showed general disruption of the fecal bacterial community structure to chow diet mice (figures 4c and s3f). later principal component analysis (figure 4d) and principal co-ordinates analysis (figure 4e) further confirmed comparable beta diversity between trained and untrained mice. analysis of molecular variance (amova) of unifrac distance showed the difference between trained and untrained mice did not reach significance (figure 4f). best discriminated taxa in each groups was presented as linear discriminant analysis (lda) effect size (lefse) (figure 4g), and difference was tested by species level (figure 4h). although there were a few differences (e.g., helicobacter typhlonius), overall trained mice and untrained mice harbor similar gut microbes. altogether, no obvious difference in gut flora between trained and untrained mice suggested the training benefits are not driven primarily by changes in gut microbes. except for gut microbiota dysbiosis, wd also leads to metabolic changes. being the biggest metabolic organ, the liver plays a vital role for lipid metabolism and protein synthesis (especially albumin synthesis). it is well known that wd is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (nafld) which can further progress to nash.2baratta f. pastori d. polimeni l. bucci t. ceci f. calabrese c. ernesti i. pannitteri g. violi f. angelico f. del ben m. adherence to mediterranean diet and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: effect on insulin resistance.am. j. gastroenterol. 2017; 112: 1832-1839google scholar even after only 4 weeks wd feeding, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) were elevated significantly (figure 5a), indicating the injury of hepatocytes. at the same time, though total protein and albumin levels shown no difference, increased cholesterol level but deceased triglyceride level were found after short-term wd feeding (figures 5b and 5c), which were further confirmed in 8-week wd fed mice (figure s4a). in addition, the expression of key enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis mevalonate pathway (figure s4b), like hmg-coa reductase (coded by hmgcr), mevalonate kinase, phosphomevalonate kinase, as well as mevalonate biphospho decarboxylase, changed markedly after wd feeding in both colon and mlns (figures 5d and 5e), indicating an adaptation for increased fat and carbohydrates intake. based on those results, we used statin, an inhibitor for mevalonate pathway rate-limiting enzyme hmg-coa reductase, in drinking water to prevent wd accompanied hypercholesterolemia in our training model (figure s5a). for mice receiving chow diet, statin treatment made no influence on weight gaining, but statin reduced weight gaining for wd feeding mice (figures 5f, 5g, s4c, and s4d). however, statin treatment had no beneficial on wd induced colon inflammation as measured by colon length (figure s4e). later, when dss was introduced (figure s5a), neither body weight (figure s5b) nor colon length (figure s5c) showed any difference among trained mice with or without statin treatment during training period. cytokines in colon also had similar expression (figure s5d), but barrier marker expression was reversed (figure s5e). similarly, 4-week statin treatment did not reverse the protective effects in the c. rodentium colitis model (figures s6a–s6e). these results suggest that wd induced colon low-grade inflammation and later training benefits are independent of enhanced cholesterol metabolism during wd feeding. altered cholesterol metabolism has been associated with innate immune cell training to inflammatory stimuli, and mevalonate is important for trained myeloid cells to more effectively combat a new infection.25bekkering s. arts r.j.w. novakovic b. kourtzelis i. van der heijden c. li y. popa c.d. ter horst r. van tuijl j. netea-maier r.t. et al.metabolic induction of trained immunity through the mevalonate pathway.cell. 2018;

4: 1-21google scholar]. from this niche, mtb must then cause inflammation, immunopathology, and cavitation to transmit and, although this can happen at any point, most cases reactivate in the first 2 years after infection [26.behr m.a. et al.revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis.bmj. 2018; 362k2738crossref pubmed scopus (172) google scholar]. with this time frame, disease evolution is typically a slow process, and changes in the peripheral transcriptome can be detected many months before presentation of active disease [27.scriba t.j. et al.sequential inflammatory processes define human progression from m. tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease.plos pathog. 2017; 13e1006687crossref pubmed scopus (114) google scholar]. as the t cell response develops, mtb needs to change strategy to reflect the more hostile environment of the host. the recent unpublished identification of changes in mtb metabolism in response to ifn-γ gives some insight into these events. in sensing host ifn-γ, mtb is able to change its metabolic rate and transcriptional programme, suggesting that it can respond to host immunological cues [28.ahmed m. et al.mycobacterium tuberculosis senses host interferon-γ via the membrane protein mmpl10.biorxiv. 2021; (published online november 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468344google scholar]. once into this second phase of the host–pathogen interaction, mtb must survive on a tightrope, ultimately needing to drive a host immune response that leads to cavitation while avoiding an effective immune response that causes its eradication. the critical structure during this ‘post-primary’ stage is the granuloma (figure 2) [29.pagan a.j. ramakrishnan l. the formation and function of granulomas.annu. rev. immunol. 2018; 36: 639-665crossref pubmed scopus (111) google scholar]. this was historically thought to be restrictive to mtb growth, but such concepts of granuloma function and structure have been questioned recently. for example, key studies in the mycobacterium marinum/zebrafish model have shown that recruitment of monocytes to the granuloma can favour pathogen proliferation [22.davis j.m. ramakrishnan l. the role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.cell. 2009;

505: 218-222crossref pubmed scopus (298) google scholar]. indeed, in the same model system, limiting the formation of epithelioid macrophages, which help to wall off the granuloma, in fact helps to limit mycobacterial growth by allowing immune cells access to the granuloma [31.cronan m.r. et al.macrophage epithelial reprogramming underlies mycobacterial granuloma formation and promotes infection.immunity. 2016; 45: 861-876abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (118) google scholar]. in addition, the traditional ‘sphere-like’ structure of granulomas has been questioned by micro-ct approaches, which suggest a more complex root-like structure of interconnected areas [32.wells g. et al.micro-computed tomography analysis of the human tuberculous lung reveals remarkable heterogeneity in 3d granuloma morphology.am. j. respir. crit. care med. 2021; 204: 583-595crossref pubmed scopus (9) google scholar], in which microenvironments may vary. in addition, whether cavities emerge from the middle of caseous necrotic granulomas or from confluent areas of lipoid pneumonia has also been disputed [33.hunter r.l. tuberculosis as a three-act play: a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis.tuberculosis (edinb). 2016; 97: 8-17crossref pubmed scopus (92) google scholar]. despite these uncertainties, it is clear that the immune response is both necessary to control infection and essential to drive the tissue destruction that leads to cavitation and spread [15.elkington p.t. et al.tuberculosis immunopathology: the neglected role of extracellular matrix destruction.sci. transl. med. 2011; 3: 71ps6crossref pubmed scopus (68) google scholar]. multiple types of immunodeficiency can lead to uncontrolled mtb infection, such as advanced hiv infection, anti-tnf-α treatment, and mutations within the ifn-γ/il-12/stat signalling pathway [19.o'garra a. et al.the immune response in tuberculosis.annu. rev. immunol. 2013; 31: 475-527crossref pubmed scopus (824) google scholar]. this has led to research that primarily focuses on identifying what is missing from the immune response to mtb that leads to disease. however, evidence that an absence of an immunological component(s) identified in individuals who progress to active tb disease does not mean that an excess will be beneficial [34.karp c.l. et al.tuberculosis vaccines: barriers and prospects on the quest for a transformative tool.immunol. rev. 2015; 264: 363-381crossref pubmed scopus (44) google scholar], and, in fact, diverse evidence shows that inflammation, driven by excessive immunity, is damaging in tb. this debate is not new and dates back to bitter disputes between koch and virchow [35.kaufmann s.h. a short history of robert koch's fight against tuberculosis: those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.tuberculosis (edinb). 2003; 83: 86-90crossref pubmed scopus (24) google scholar], over whether koch’s tuberculin vaccine would cure infection or provoke an immune response that degraded the granuloma and enhanced disease. on the one hand, human studies and animal models provide clear evidence that immunological memory from tb exposure is protective [36.andrews j.r. et al.risk of progression to active tuberculosis following reinfection with mycobacterium tuberculosis.clin. infect. dis. 2012;

14e1007305crossref pubmed scopus (43) google scholar]. on the other hand, in a seminal large-scale epidemiological study, comstock demonstrated the surprising finding that, among tuberculin reactors, those with the greatest delayed-type hypersensitivity response had the highest risk of subsequent development of tb many years later [38.comstock g.w. et al.the prognosis of a positive tuberculin reaction in childhood and adolescence.am. j. epidemiol. 1974; 99: 131-138crossref pubmed scopus (492) google scholar]. one potential interpretation is that an excessive immune response to mtb antigens is detrimental. with the onset of the hiv pandemic, the clinical features differentiating ‘standard’ tb from immunocompromised tb proved that the immune response contributes to lung immunopathology and spread, because cavities are rarely observed in individuals with advanced hiv-related immunocompromise, but occur on immune reconstitution with antiretroviral treatment [39.kwan c.k. ernst j.d. hiv and tuberculosis: a deadly human syndemic.clin. microbiol. rev. 2011; 24: 351-376crossref pubmed scopus (395) google scholar]. the demonstration that t cell epitopes of mtb are hyperconserved compared with nonepitope regions further suggests that the pathogen derives an evolutionary benefit from promoting the host t cell response [40.coscolla m. et al.m. tuberculosis t cell epitope analysis reveals paucity of antigenic variation and identifies rare variable tb antigens.cell host microbe. 2015;

201: 407-413crossref pubmed scopus (12) google scholar]. along similar lines, the concept that the optimal strategy for humans might be to sequester and tolerate mtb has been proposed, and the breakdown of this tolerance leads to active disease [44.olive a.j. sassetti c.m. tolerating the unwelcome guest; how the host withstands persistent mycobacterium tuberculosis.front. immunol. 2018; 9: 2094crossref pubmed scopus (11) google scholar,45.divangahi m. et al.beyond killing mycobacterium tuberculosis: disease tolerance.front. immunol. 2018; 9: 2976crossref pubmed scopus (17) google scholar]. the fraction of individuals defined as latently infected who in fact harbour viable bacteria is debated [46.behr m.a. et al.latent tuberculosis: two centuries of confusion.am. j. respir. crit. care med. 2021; 204: 142-148pubmed google scholar], but reactivation of mtb can occur decades after initial infection [47.lillebaek t. et al.molecular evidence of endogenous reactivation of mycobacterium tuberculosis after 33 years of latent infection.j. infect. dis. 2002; 185: 401-404crossref pubmed scopus (176) google scholar], suggesting that this tolerant phenotype can be extremely durable. adding to the complexity of tb immunology is the fact that tb lesions can have diverse outcomes even in the same individual [11.dubos r. dubos j. the white plague: tuberculosis, man, and society. rutgers university press, 1987google scholar]. this was summed up neatly by georges canetti in 1955, based on examining thousands of tuberculous lungs before the advent of antimicrobial treatment: ‘consider the bacillus in the lesion, experiencing such different fates in various foci of the same patient, and the same fate in widely different patients; destroyed in a certain histologic reaction and thriving in another nearby’ [48.canetti g. the tubercle bacillus in the pulmonary lesion of man: histobacteriology and its bearing on the therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis.the tubercle bacillus in the pulmonary lesion of man: histobacteriology and its bearing on the therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis. springer, 1955google scholar]. likewise, dubos wrote in 1952 ‘all these processes may occur in the same person either at different times or often simultaneously…which is still almost as much a puzzle today’. this concurrent progression and regression of lesions has been elegantly confirmed in modern imaging studies of infected non-human primates (nhps) [10.lin p.l. et al.sterilization of granulomas is common in active and latent tuberculosis despite within-host variability in bacterial killing.nat. med. 2014; 20: 75-79crossref pubmed scopus (325) google scholar]. consequently, it appears that the outcome of infectious foci is determined at a local granuloma level and not systemically, adding to the challenges of dissecting determinants of outcome. one proposed paradigm is that a balance within granulomas is necessary, with both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators leading to control of infection [49.cadena a.m. et al.heterogeneity in tuberculosis.nat. rev. immunol. 2017; 17: 691-702crossref pubmed scopus (216) google scholar,50.gideon h.p. et al.variability in tuberculosis granuloma t cell responses exists, but a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is associated with sterilization.plos pathog. 2015; 11e1004603crossref pubmed scopus (190) google scholar]. with their pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response, dendritic cells are also likely to have a central role in shaping the immune response and defining outcome [51.polak m.e. singh h. tolerogenic and immunogenic states of langerhans cells are orchestrated by epidermal signals acting on a core maturation gene module.bioessays. 2021; 43e2000182crossref pubmed scopus (3) google scholar]. however, because these events occur within tissue, they are challenging to investigate, and studying the host response in the periphery is unlikely to convey sufficient granularity about individual lesions [52.cliff j.m. et al.the human immune response to tuberculosis and its treatment: a view from the blood.immunol. rev. 2015; 264: 88-102crossref pubmed scopus (103) google scholar]. therefore, events determining outcome within individual tb granulomas remain a highly pressing question, and omics analyses should provide a wealth of data to give mechanistic understanding. recently, several studies reported unbiased analyses aiming to unpick the process. a strategy of comparing tb granulomas with sarcoidosis, a non-infectious granulomatous disease, was utilised to overcome the issue of cell-specific gene expression patterns [53.reichmann m.t. et al.integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.j. clin. invest. 2021; 131e148136pubmed google scholar]. diverse analytical approaches demonstrated that the collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp1) was highly upregulated in tb and was the most significantly differentially expressed gene between tb and sarcoidosis. analysis of gene correlations identified a seven-gene tb-specific cluster, comprising mmp1, the monocyte chemoattractants c-c motif chemokine ligand 7 and 8 (ccl7 and ccl8), the divalent transition metal transporter solute carrier family 11 member 1 (slc11a1; formerly known as nramp1), oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (olr1; formerly known as lox1), family with sequence similarity 124 member a (fam124a), and galectin 14 pseudogene (lgals17a). several of these genes have already been implicated in tb pathogenesis, and consideration of their known functions together informs a putative sequence of events that leads to progression of tb lesions (figure 3, key figure). thus, sequencing of clinical material followed by unbiased analysis generated a hypothesised cascade of disease evolution that can be experimentally investigated. further bioinformatic analyses in combination with a 3d biomimetic model identified that sphingosine 1 kinase inhibition suppressed mtb growth, thereby progressing from basic disease understanding to novel therapeutic targets in an unbiased manner [53.reichmann m.t. et al.integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.j. clin. invest. 2021; 131e148136pubmed google scholar]. using a similar transcriptomic approach, analysis of gene expression was compared in skin stimulated by tuberculin in patients with tb versus healthy controls [54.pollara g. et al.exaggerated il-17a activity in human in vivo recall responses discriminates active tuberculosis from latent infection and cured disease.sci. transl. med. 2021; 13: eabg7673crossref pubmed scopus (8) google scholar]. again, mmp1 emerged as a top divergently upregulated gene, and ingenuity pathway analysis suggested that an excessive il-17 response was a key regulator. the il-17/mmp1 profile resolved with treatment of infection, implying that mtb actively primes an excessive, matrix-destructive immune response that can be replicated by a distal antigenic challenge. the authors highlighted the double-edged sword of il-17 in tb, with data supporting a protective role [55.ogongo p. et al.tissue-resident-like cd4+ t cells secreting il-17 control mycobacterium tuberculosis in the human lung.j. clin. invest. 2021;

20: e117-e128abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (24) google scholar]. therefore, for efficient transmission, mtb must cause immunopathology and lung matrix destruction at the apices of the lung to exit the host and spread onward [15.elkington p.t. et al.tuberculosis immunopathology: the neglected role of extracellular matrix destruction.sci. transl. med. 2011; 3: 71ps6crossref pubmed scopus (68) google scholar]. in addition, recent pet-ct data suggest that propagation of tb within the lung starts with cavitation, followed by the seeding of new infection foci via bronchial spread [16.chen r.y. et al.radiological and functional evidence of the bronchial spread of tuberculosis: an observational analysis.lancet microbe. 2021; 2: e518-e526abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (6) google scholar]. therefore, cavitation appears to be central for disease progression within the host as well as onward transmission in the population. in initial infection, mtb aerosol droplets are typically inhaled to the well-ventilated lower lobes and phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages, although definitive proof in humans is difficult to obtain and not all early lesions are basal. alveolar macrophages are poor at controlling mtb [17.cohen s.b. et al.alveolar macrophages provide an early mycobacterium tuberculosis niche and initiate dissemination.cell host microbe. 2018; 24: 439-446 e4abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (159) google scholar], and an initial proliferation generates a large focus of infected cells, often over 5 mm in diameter, as demonstrated by the ghon focus in the lung base [18.ghon a. the primary lung focus of tuberculosis in children. churchill, london1916google scholar]. during this period, mtb proliferation is unrestricted by an adaptive host immune response, and it uses a variety of evasion capabilities to proliferate within a range of phagocytes, such as inhibiting phagolysosomal fusion [19.o'garra a. et al.the immune response in tuberculosis.annu. rev. immunol. 2013; 31: 475-527crossref pubmed scopus (824) google scholar]. subsequently, at around 6 weeks, a t cell response develops, which is delayed relative to other respiratory pathogens [20.ravesloot-chavez m.m. et al.the innate immune response to mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.annu. rev. immunol. 2021; 39: 611-637crossref pubmed scopus (9) google scholar] but ultimately leads to more efficacious control of mtb. by this stage, mtb needs to have spread to the lung apex, from where it will exit and restart the infectious cycle [13.elkington p.t. friedland j.s. permutations of time and place in tuberculosis.lancet infect. dis. 2015;

4: 1-21google scholar]. from this niche, mtb must then cause inflammation, immunopathology, and cavitation to transmit and, although this can happen at any point, most cases reactivate in the first 2 years after infection [26.behr m.a. et al.revisiting the timetable of tuberculosis.bmj. 2018; 362k2738crossref pubmed scopus (172) google scholar]. with this time frame, disease evolution is typically a slow process, and changes in the peripheral transcriptome can be detected many months before presentation of active disease [27.scriba t.j. et al.sequential inflammatory processes define human progression from m. tuberculosis infection to tuberculosis disease.plos pathog. 2017; 13e1006687crossref pubmed scopus (114) google scholar]. as the t cell response develops, mtb needs to change strategy to reflect the more hostile environment of the host. the recent unpublished identification of changes in mtb metabolism in response to ifn-γ gives some insight into these events. in sensing host ifn-γ, mtb is able to change its metabolic rate and transcriptional programme, suggesting that it can respond to host immunological cues [28.ahmed m. et al.mycobacterium tuberculosis senses host interferon-γ via the membrane protein mmpl10.biorxiv. 2021; (published online november 12, 2021)https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468344google scholar]. once into this second phase of the host–pathogen interaction, mtb must survive on a tightrope, ultimately needing to drive a host immune response that leads to cavitation while avoiding an effective immune response that causes its eradication. the critical structure during this ‘post-primary’ stage is the granuloma (figure 2) [29.pagan a.j. ramakrishnan l. the formation and function of granulomas.annu. rev. immunol. 2018; 36: 639-665crossref pubmed scopus (111) google scholar]. this was historically thought to be restrictive to mtb growth, but such concepts of granuloma function and structure have been questioned recently. for example, key studies in the mycobacterium marinum/zebrafish model have shown that recruitment of monocytes to the granuloma can favour pathogen proliferation [22.davis j.m. ramakrishnan l. the role of the granuloma in expansion and dissemination of early tuberculous infection.cell. 2009;

505: 218-222crossref pubmed scopus (298) google scholar]. indeed, in the same model system, limiting the formation of epithelioid macrophages, which help to wall off the granuloma, in fact helps to limit mycobacterial growth by allowing immune cells access to the granuloma [31.cronan m.r. et al.macrophage epithelial reprogramming underlies mycobacterial granuloma formation and promotes infection.immunity. 2016; 45: 861-876abstract full text full text pdf pubmed scopus (118) google scholar]. in addition, the traditional ‘sphere-like’ structure of granulomas has been questioned by micro-ct approaches, which suggest a more complex root-like structure of interconnected areas [32.wells g. et al.micro-computed tomography analysis of the human tuberculous lung reveals remarkable heterogeneity in 3d granuloma morphology.am. j. respir. crit. care med. 2021; 204: 583-595crossref pubmed scopus (9) google scholar], in which microenvironments may vary. in addition, whether cavities emerge from the middle of caseous necrotic granulomas or from confluent areas of lipoid pneumonia has also been disputed [33.hunter r.l. tuberculosis as a three-act play: a new paradigm for the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis.tuberculosis (edinb). 2016; 97: 8-17crossref pubmed scopus (92) google scholar]. despite these uncertainties, it is clear that the immune response is both necessary to control infection and essential to drive the tissue destruction that leads to cavitation and spread [15.elkington p.t. et al.tuberculosis immunopathology: the neglected role of extracellular matrix destruction.sci. transl. med. 2011; 3: 71ps6crossref pubmed scopus (68) google scholar]. multiple types of immunodeficiency can lead to uncontrolled mtb infection, such as advanced hiv infection, anti-tnf-α treatment, and mutations within the ifn-γ/il-12/stat signalling pathway [19.o'garra a. et al.the immune response in tuberculosis.annu. rev. immunol. 2013; 31: 475-527crossref pubmed scopus (824) google scholar]. this has led to research that primarily focuses on identifying what is missing from the immune response to mtb that leads to disease. however, evidence that an absence of an immunological component(s) identified in individuals who progress to active tb disease does not mean that an excess will be beneficial [34.karp c.l. et al.tuberculosis vaccines: barriers and prospects on the quest for a transformative tool.immunol. rev. 2015; 264: 363-381crossref pubmed scopus (44) google scholar], and, in fact, diverse evidence shows that inflammation, driven by excessive immunity, is damaging in tb. this debate is not new and dates back to bitter disputes between koch and virchow [35.kaufmann s.h. a short history of robert koch's fight against tuberculosis: those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.tuberculosis (edinb). 2003; 83: 86-90crossref pubmed scopus (24) google scholar], over whether koch’s tuberculin vaccine would cure infection or provoke an immune response that degraded the granuloma and enhanced disease. on the one hand, human studies and animal models provide clear evidence that immunological memory from tb exposure is protective [36.andrews j.r. et al.risk of progression to active tuberculosis following reinfection with mycobacterium tuberculosis.clin. infect. dis. 2012; 54: 784-791crossref pubmed scopus (226) google scholar,37.cadena a.m. et al.concurrent infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis confers robust protection against secondary infection in macaques.plos pathog. 2018; 14e1007305crossref pubmed scopus (43) google scholar]. on the other hand, in a seminal large-scale epidemiological study, comstock demonstrated the surprising finding that, among tuberculin reactors, those with the greatest delayed-type hypersensitivity response had the highest risk of subsequent development of tb many years later [38.comstock g.w. et al.the prognosis of a positive tuberculin reaction in childhood and adolescence.am. j. epidemiol. 1974; 99: 131-138crossref pubmed scopus (492) google scholar]. one potential interpretation is that an excessive immune response to mtb antigens is detrimental. with the onset of the hiv pandemic, the clinical features differentiating ‘standard’ tb from immunocompromised tb proved that the immune response contributes to lung immunopathology and spread, because cavities are rarely observed in individuals with advanced hiv-related immunocompromise, but occur on immune reconstitution with antiretroviral treatment [39.kwan c.k. ernst j.d. hiv and tuberculosis: a deadly human syndemic.clin. microbiol. rev. 2011; 24: 351-376crossref pubmed scopus (395) google scholar]. the demonstration that t cell epitopes of mtb are hyperconserved compared with nonepitope regions further suggests that the pathogen derives an evolutionary benefit from promoting the host t cell response [40.coscolla m. et al.m. tuberculosis t cell epitope analysis reveals paucity of antigenic variation and identifies rare variable tb antigens.cell host microbe. 2015;

201: 407-413crossref pubmed scopus (12) google scholar]. along similar lines, the concept that the optimal strategy for humans might be to sequester and tolerate mtb has been proposed, and the breakdown of this tolerance leads to active disease [44.olive a.j. sassetti c.m. tolerating the unwelcome guest; how the host withstands persistent mycobacterium tuberculosis.front. immunol. 2018; 9: 2094crossref pubmed scopus (11) google scholar,45.divangahi m. et al.beyond killing mycobacterium tuberculosis: disease tolerance.front. immunol. 2018; 9: 2976crossref pubmed scopus (17) google scholar]. the fraction of individuals defined as latently infected who in fact harbour viable bacteria is debated [46.behr m.a. et al.latent tuberculosis: two centuries of confusion.am. j. respir. crit. care med. 2021; 204: 142-148pubmed google scholar], but reactivation of mtb can occur decades after initial infection [47.lillebaek t. et al.molecular evidence of endogenous reactivation of mycobacterium tuberculosis after 33 years of latent infection.j. infect. dis. 2002; 185: 401-404crossref pubmed scopus (176) google scholar], suggesting that this tolerant phenotype can be extremely durable. adding to the complexity of tb immunology is the fact that tb lesions can have diverse outcomes even in the same individual [11.dubos r. dubos j. the white plague: tuberculosis, man, and society. rutgers university press, 1987google scholar]. this was summed up neatly by georges canetti in 1955, based on examining thousands of tuberculous lungs before the advent of antimicrobial treatment: ‘consider the bacillus in the lesion, experiencing such different fates in various foci of the same patient, and the same fate in widely different patients; destroyed in a certain histologic reaction and thriving in another nearby’ [48.canetti g. the tubercle bacillus in the pulmonary lesion of man: histobacteriology and its bearing on the therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis.the tubercle bacillus in the pulmonary lesion of man: histobacteriology and its bearing on the therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis. springer, 1955google scholar]. likewise, dubos wrote in 1952 ‘all these processes may occur in the same person either at different times or often simultaneously…which is still almost as much a puzzle today’. this concurrent progression and regression of lesions has been elegantly confirmed in modern imaging studies of infected non-human primates (nhps) [10.lin p.l. et al.sterilization of granulomas is common in active and latent tuberculosis despite within-host variability in bacterial killing.nat. med. 2014; 20: 75-79crossref pubmed scopus (325) google scholar]. consequently, it appears that the outcome of infectious foci is determined at a local granuloma level and not systemically, adding to the challenges of dissecting determinants of outcome. one proposed paradigm is that a balance within granulomas is necessary, with both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators leading to control of infection [49.cadena a.m. et al.heterogeneity in tuberculosis.nat. rev. immunol. 2017; 17: 691-702crossref pubmed scopus (216) google scholar,50.gideon h.p. et al.variability in tuberculosis granuloma t cell responses exists, but a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is associated with sterilization.plos pathog. 2015; 11e1004603crossref pubmed scopus (190) google scholar]. with their pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response, dendritic cells are also likely to have a central role in shaping the immune response and defining outcome [51.polak m.e. singh h. tolerogenic and immunogenic states of langerhans cells are orchestrated by epidermal signals acting on a core maturation gene module.bioessays. 2021; 43e2000182crossref pubmed scopus (3) google scholar]. however, because these events occur within tissue, they are challenging to investigate, and studying the host response in the periphery is unlikely to convey sufficient granularity about individual lesions [52.cliff j.m. et al.the human immune response to tuberculosis and its treatment: a view from the blood.immunol. rev. 2015; 264: 88-102crossref pubmed scopus (103) google scholar]. therefore, events determining outcome within individual tb granulomas remain a highly pressing question, and omics analyses should provide a wealth of data to give mechanistic understanding. recently, several studies reported unbiased analyses aiming to unpick the process. a strategy of comparing tb granulomas with sarcoidosis, a non-infectious granulomatous disease, was utilised to overcome the issue of cell-specific gene expression patterns [53.reichmann m.t. et al.integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.j. clin. invest. 2021; 131e148136pubmed google scholar]. diverse analytical approaches demonstrated that the collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1 (mmp1) was highly upregulated in tb and was the most significantly differentially expressed gene between tb and sarcoidosis. analysis of gene correlations identified a seven-gene tb-specific cluster, comprising mmp1, the monocyte chemoattractants c-c motif chemokine ligand 7 and 8 (ccl7 and ccl8), the divalent transition metal transporter solute carrier family 11 member 1 (slc11a1; formerly known as nramp1), oxidised low-density lipoprotein receptor 1 (olr1; formerly known as lox1), family with sequence similarity 124 member a (fam124a), and galectin 14 pseudogene (lgals17a). several of these genes have already been implicated in tb pathogenesis, and consideration of their known functions together informs a putative sequence of events that leads to progression of tb lesions (figure 3, key figure). thus, sequencing of clinical material followed by unbiased analysis generated a hypothesised cascade of disease evolution that can be experimentally investigated. further bioinformatic analyses in combination with a 3d biomimetic model identified that sphingosine 1 kinase inhibition suppressed mtb growth, thereby progressing from basic disease understanding to novel therapeutic targets in an unbiased manner [53.reichmann m.t. et al.integrated transcriptomic analysis of human tuberculosis granulomas and a biomimetic model identifies therapeutic targets.j. clin. invest. 2021; 131e148136pubmed google scholar]. using a similar transcriptomic approach, analysis of gene expression was compared in skin stimulated by tuberculin in patients with tb versus healthy controls [54.pollara g. et al.exaggerated il-17a activity in human in vivo recall responses discriminates active tuberculosis from latent infection and cured disease.sci. transl. med. 2021; 13: eabg7673crossref pubmed scopus (8) google scholar]. again, mmp1 emerged as a top divergently upregulated gene, and ingenuity pathway analysis suggested that an excessive il-17 response was a key regulator. the il-17/mmp1 profile resolved with treatment of infection, implying that mtb actively primes an excessive, matrix-destructive immune response that can be replicated by a distal antigenic challenge. the authors highlighted the double-edged sword of il-17 in tb, with data supporting a protective role [55.ogongo p. et al.tissue-resident-like cd4+ t cells secreting il-17 control mycobacterium tuberculosis in the human lung.j. clin. invest. 2021; 131e142014crossref pubmed scopus (11) google scholar,56.dijkman k. et al.prevention of tuberculosis infection and disease by local bcg in repeatedly exposed rhesus macaques.nat. med. 2019; 25: 255-262crossref pubmed scopus (123) google scholar] and a pathological role when present in excess [54.pollara g. et al.exaggerated il-17a activity in human in vivo recall responses discriminates active tuberculosis from latent infection and cured disease.sci. transl. med. 2021;

31: 231-236crossref pubmed scopus (78) google scholar]. for children, the various forms of undernutrition include low weight-for-age referred to as underweight, which can progress to a more severe wasting form. stunting or low height-for-age can result from chronic undernutrition or frequent recurrences of undernutrition and infection, with the consequence of impairing both cognitive and physical development. micronutrient deficiency, especially iron but also zinc and others, can also exacerbate the cognitive and physical impairments of stunting. the who estimates that approximately 462 million adults are underweight, while in 2020 approximately 149 million children under 5 years were stunted, and 45 million children wasted. moreover, almost one-half of the under-5-years’ childhood deaths result from undernutrition, predominantly in lmicsi. the university of washington’s institute for health metrics and evaluation (uw-ihme) found that protein–energy malnutrition caused 212 000 deaths among children under 5 years in 2019ii, such that protein–energy malnutrition is a leading cause of childhood suffering and deaths globally. in addition, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia was responsible for 42 300 deaths. the african continent and south and southeast asia share some of the highest rates of both iron-deficiency and protein–energy malnutrition. many of these regions also suffer the highest rates of infectious diarrheal disease and illness, as well as hookworm infection, and malaria (and other conditions), each of which exacerbates undernutrition. table 1 shows a comparison between the geographic distribution of protein–energy malnutrition, and iron micronutrient deficiency, hookworm infection, and diarrheal disease and illness.table 1comparison of protein–energy malnutrition with iron micronutrient deficiency and diarrheal diseaseadata from the global burden of disease study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019).conditionprevalence (no. of cases)deathsdisability-adjusted life yearsworst affected areasprotein–energy malnutrition148 million212 00015.3 millioneast africasahelian west africaindonesiamesoamericahaitiiron-micronutrient deficiency and anemianot determined42 30031.3 millioneast africasahelian west africayemenindia and pakistanpapua new guineahookworm disease173 million—1.0 millioneast and central africasahelian west africaindiapapua new guinea, laosmalaria181 million643 00046.4 millioncentral and west africaindiadiarrheal disease and illness99 million1.53 million80.9 millioneast africasahelian west africaindiaa data from the global burden of disease study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019). open table in a new tab in 2022, united nations (un) secretary general antonio guterres warned of a looming global food shortage with potentially 1.6 billion people not having enough to eat and 250 million living at the brink of famine. the un world food program finds that millions of people already face imminent famine, and project hundreds of millions are at risk for mass starvation. the major driver has been the war in ukraine, where a significant percentage of the world’s wheat and other grains and fertilizer is produced, in combination with drought, high temperatures from climate change, and supply-chain interruptions due to the pandemic. the interruptions from the war and the other factors listed in the preceding text caused the un’s food and agricultural price index to reach all-time highs. many food-insecure areas of the world, including the african continent and south and central asia can no longer afford food imports, or face reduced access due to their dependence on ukraine. the most vulnerable areas include east africa and the sahelian countries of west africa, where climate change has produced soaring temperatures, profound drought, and diminished agricultural production. certain human infections, especially chronic infections, can cause micronutrient deficiency, undernutrition, or in some cases both forms of malnutrition. in turn, undernutrition can often worsen or exacerbate the clinical course of infectious diseases. human hookworm infection is a classic example of a chronic infection producing a micronutrient deficiency. in africa, hookworm often combines with malaria and schistosomiasis. both children and women of reproductive age, including those who are pregnant, are especially vulnerable to the combined anemia that results from this polyparasitism [2.kinyoki d. et al.anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2018.nat. med. 2021; 27: 1761-1782crossref pubmed scopus (17) google scholar]. persistent or recurring diarrhea, especially from bacterial pathogens, may cause even greater levels of protein–energy malnutrition and stunting [1.walson j.l. berkley j.a. the impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.curr. opin. infect. dis. 2018; 31: 231-236crossref pubmed scopus (78) google scholar]. an exhaustive study to determine the etiology of childhood diarrheal illness concluded that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) producing heat stable toxin (st-etec) and shigella rank among the most important bacterial causes of moderate or severe diarrhea in children under 5 years, in addition to cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infection [3.kotloff k.l. bacterial diarrhoea.curr. opin. pediatr. 2022; 34: 147-155crossref pubmed scopus (5) google scholar]. however, in some localities, campylobacter, vibrio cholera o1 (cholera), and aeromonas are also important bacterial causes; with increasing rotavirus vaccination coverage the bacterial pathogens are becoming the dominant etiologies in lmics (with many strains exhibiting multidrug resistance). in addition to the diarrhea-causing pathogens, mycobacterium tuberculosis induces chronic inflammation leading to wasting or cachexia through the production of a cachectin inflammatory mediator [4.baazim h. et al.the interplay of immunology and cachexia in infection and cancer.nat. rev. immunol. 2022; 22: 309-321crossref pubmed scopus (17) google scholar]. the relationship between infection and malnutrition is bidirectional, meaning that the infections highlighted in the preceding text promote undernutrition, while undernutrition can simultaneously increase susceptibility to these infections [1.walson j.l. berkley j.a. the impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.curr. opin. infect. dis. 2018; 31: 231-236crossref pubmed scopus (78) google scholar]. the mechanisms proposed include destruction of the integrity and biogenesis of the gut and respiratory cellular mucosa, alterations in host microbiomes (microbiota), and dysfunctions in the hemopoietic and lymphoid organs and liver and biliary system [1.walson j.l. berkley j.a. the impact of malnutrition on childhood infections.curr. opin. infect. dis. 2018;

31: 231-236crossref pubmed scopus (78) google scholar]. for children, the various forms of undernutrition include low weight-for-age referred to as underweight, which can progress to a more severe wasting form. stunting or low height-for-age can result from chronic undernutrition or frequent recurrences of undernutrition and infection, with the consequence of impairing both cognitive and physical development. micronutrient deficiency, especially iron but also zinc and others, can also exacerbate the cognitive and physical impairments of stunting. the who estimates that approximately 462 million adults are underweight, while in 2020 approximately 149 million children under 5 years were stunted, and 45 million children wasted. moreover, almost one-half of the under-5-years’ childhood deaths result from undernutrition, predominantly in lmicsi. the university of washington’s institute for health metrics and evaluation (uw-ihme) found that protein–energy malnutrition caused 212 000 deaths among children under 5 years in 2019ii, such that protein–energy malnutrition is a leading cause of childhood suffering and deaths globally. in addition, iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia was responsible for 42 300 deaths. the african continent and south and southeast asia share some of the highest rates of both iron-deficiency and protein–energy malnutrition. many of these regions also suffer the highest rates of infectious diarrheal disease and illness, as well as hookworm infection, and malaria (and other conditions), each of which exacerbates undernutrition. table 1 shows a comparison between the geographic distribution of protein–energy malnutrition, and iron micronutrient deficiency, hookworm infection, and diarrheal disease and illness.table 1comparison of protein–energy malnutrition with iron micronutrient deficiency and diarrheal diseaseadata from the global burden of disease study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019).conditionprevalence (no. of cases)deathsdisability-adjusted life yearsworst affected areasprotein–energy malnutrition148 million212 00015.3 millioneast africasahelian west africaindonesiamesoamericahaitiiron-micronutrient deficiency and anemianot determined42 30031.3 millioneast africasahelian west africayemenindia and pakistanpapua new guineahookworm disease173 million—1.0 millioneast and central africasahelian west africaindiapapua new guinea, laosmalaria181 million643 00046.4 millioncentral and west africaindiadiarrheal disease and illness99 million1.53 million80.9 millioneast africasahelian west africaindiaa data from the global burden of disease study 2019 (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019). open table in a new tab in 2022, united nations (un) secretary general antonio guterres warned of a looming global food shortage with potentially 1.6 billion people not having enough to eat and 250 million living at the brink of famine. the un world food program finds that millions of people already face imminent famine, and project hundreds of millions are at risk for mass starvation. the major driver has been the war in ukraine, where a significant percentage of the world’s wheat and other grains and fertilizer is produced, in combination with drought, high temperatures from climate change, and supply-chain interruptions due to the pandemic. the interruptions from the war and the other factors listed in the preceding text caused the un’s food and agricultural price index to reach all-time highs. many food-insecure areas of the world, including the african continent and south and central asia can no longer afford food imports, or face reduced access due to their dependence on ukraine. the most vulnerable areas include east africa and the sahelian countries of west africa, where climate change has produced soaring temperatures, profound drought, and diminished agricultural production. certain human infections, especially chronic infections, can cause micronutrient deficiency, undernutrition, or in some cases both forms of malnutrition. in turn, undernutrition can often worsen or exacerbate the clinical course of infectious diseases. human hookworm infection is a classic example of a chronic infection producing a micronutrient deficiency. in africa, hookworm often combines with malaria and schistosomiasis. both children and women of reproductive age, including those who are pregnant, are especially vulnerable to the combined anemia that results from this polyparasitism [2.kinyoki d. et al.anemia prevalence in women of reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries between 2000 and 2018.nat. med. 2021;

31: 231-236crossref pubmed scopus (78) google scholar]. an exhaustive study to determine the etiology of childhood diarrheal illness concluded that enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) producing heat stable toxin (st-etec) and shigella rank among the most important bacterial causes of moderate or severe diarrhea in children under 5 years, in addition to cryptosporidiosis and rotavirus infection [3.kotloff k.l. bacterial diarrhoea.curr. opin. pediatr. 2022; 34: 147-155crossref pubmed scopus (5) google scholar]. however, in some localities, campylobacter, vibrio cholera o1 (cholera), and aeromonas are also important bacterial causes; with increasing rotavirus vaccination coverage the bacterial pathogens are becoming the dominant etiologies in lmics (with many strains exhibiting multidrug resistance). in addition to the diarrhea-causing pathogens, mycobacterium tuberculosis induces chronic inflammation leading to wasting or cachexia through the production of a cachectin inflammatory mediator [4.baazim h. et al.the interplay of immunology and cachexia in infection and cancer.nat. rev. immunol. 2022;

we compare the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) with mitomycin c on recurrence of stages ta and t1 bladder carcinoma. materials and methods: combined published and unpublished data from comparative studies on bcg versus mitomycin c for superficial bladder carcinoma considering possible confounding factors were analyzed. odds ratio (or) and its 95% ci were used as primary effect size estimate. toxicity data were evaluated descriptively. results: in 11 eligible clinical trials 1,421 patients were treated with bcg and 1,328 were treated with mitomycin c. within the overall median followup time of 26 months 38.6% of the patients in the bcg group and 46.4% of those in the mitomycin c group had tumor recurrence. in 7 of 11 studies bcg was significantly superior to mitomycin c, in 3 studies no significant difference was found, while in 1 study mitomycin c was significantly superior to bcg. an overall statistically significant superiority of bcg versus mitomycin c efficacy in reducing tumor recurrence was detected (or 0.56, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.84, p = 0.005). in the subgroup treated with bcg maintenance all 6 individual studies showed a significant superiority of bcg over mitomycin c (or 0.43, 95% ci 0.35 to 0.53, p <0.001). in 4 of the 5 studies with reported data on toxicity bcg associated cystitis was significantly more frequent than in the mitomycin c group (53.8% versus 39.2%). the combined cystitis or was 1.81 (95% ci 1.48 to 2.23, p <0.001). the or for cystitis in the bcg maintenance group did not significantly differ from that in the nonmaintenance therapy group. conclusions: the results suggest superiority of bcg over mitomycin c for prevention of tumor recurrences in the combined data and particularly in the bcg maintenance treatment subgroup, irrespective of the actual (intermediate or high) tumor risk status. the toxicity with bcg is higher but does not differ between bcg maintenance and nonmaintenance groups. references 1 : a combined analysis of european organization for research and treatment of cancer and medical research council randomized clinical trials for the

we compare the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of intravesical bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) with mitomycin c on recurrence of stages ta and t1 bladder carcinoma. materials and methods: combined published and unpublished data from comparative studies on bcg versus mitomycin c for superficial bladder carcinoma considering possible confounding factors were analyzed. odds ratio (or) and its 95% ci were used as primary effect size estimate. toxicity data were evaluated descriptively. results: in 11 eligible clinical trials 1,421 patients were treated with bcg and 1,328 were treated with mitomycin c. within the overall median followup time of 26 months 38.6% of the patients in the bcg group and 46.4% of those in the mitomycin c group had tumor recurrence. in 7 of 11 studies bcg was significantly superior to mitomycin c, in 3 studies no significant difference was found, while in 1 study mitomycin c was significantly superior to bcg. an overall statistically significant superiority of bcg versus mitomycin c efficacy in reducing tumor recurrence was detected (or 0.56, 95% ci 0.38 to 0.84, p = 0.005). in the subgroup treated with bcg maintenance all 6 individual studies showed a significant superiority of bcg over mitomycin c (or 0.43, 95% ci 0.35 to 0.53, p <0.001). in 4 of the 5 studies with reported data on toxicity bcg associated cystitis was significantly more frequent than in the mitomycin c group (53.8% versus 39.2%). the combined cystitis or was 1.81 (95% ci 1.48 to 2.23, p <0.001). the or for cystitis in the bcg maintenance group did not significantly differ from that in the nonmaintenance therapy group. conclusions: the results suggest superiority of bcg over mitomycin c for prevention of tumor recurrences in the combined data and particularly in the bcg maintenance treatment subgroup, irrespective of the actual (intermediate or high) tumor risk status. the toxicity with bcg is higher but does not differ between bcg maintenance and nonmaintenance groups. references 1 : a combined analysis of european organization for research and treatment of cancer and medical research council randomized clinical trials for the

the unwto estimates combine the length of stays of domestic and international tourists, including visitors from several countries other than the usa, canada, france, and taiwan; and for egypt, a country with rapid changes in the political, economic, and tourism fields, it would be inaccurate to confidently consider these incomplete statistical data for the present model of february, 2020. full-text pdf estimation of covid-19 burden in egypt – authors' replywe thank mohamed hassany and colleagues, ahmed negida, tarek sahmoud, and khaled elmeleegy for raising their concerns about our modelling study. we would like to reiterate that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in every country worldwide (egypt included) is an underestimate of the true burden of illness, regardless of the screening programmes in place. although we are aware that all modelling studies have limitations, we believe that it is important to rely on multiple sources of information to have a more accurate reflection of the so-called ground truth. full-text pdf estimation of covid-19 burden in egyptwe read with interest the correspondence by ashleigh tuite and colleagues.1 we thank them for their interest in estimating the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) burden in egypt. however, their model-based calculations used the number of patients known on march 6, and the numbers of patients and deaths are continuously changing. attempting to reach a more up-to-date estimate of the expected number of patients in egypt, we used other assumptions according to real-life data. full-text pdf",2020,"2023-07-03 03:14:54","2023-07-03 03:14:54",NA,"895–896",NA,8,20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Publisher: Elsevier BV Type: journal-article",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"estimation of covid-19 burden in egypt i read with interest the correspondence by ashleigh tuite and colleagues,1tuite ar ng v rees e et al.estimation of the covid-19 burden in egypt through exported case detection.lancet infect dis. 2020;

the unwto estimates combine the length of stays of domestic and international tourists, including visitors from several countries other than the usa, canada, france, and taiwan; and for egypt, a country with rapid changes in the political, economic, and tourism fields, it would be inaccurate to confidently consider these incomplete statistical data for the present model of february, 2020. full-text pdf estimation of covid-19 burden in egypt – authors' replywe thank mohamed hassany and colleagues, ahmed negida, tarek sahmoud, and khaled elmeleegy for raising their concerns about our modelling study. we would like to reiterate that the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) in every country worldwide (egypt included) is an underestimate of the true burden of illness, regardless of the screening programmes in place. although we are aware that all modelling studies have limitations, we believe that it is important to rely on multiple sources of information to have a more accurate reflection of the so-called ground truth. full-text pdf estimation of covid-19 burden in egyptwe read with interest the correspondence by ashleigh tuite and colleagues.1 we thank them for their interest in estimating the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) burden in egypt. however, their model-based calculations used the number of patients known on march 6, and the numbers of patients and deaths are continuously changing. attempting to reach a more up-to-date estimate of the expected number of patients in egypt, we used other assumptions according to real-life data. full-text pdf"

beijing institute of biological products/sinopharm). in addition to these novel approaches, a number of groups are looking to repurpose existing vaccines, the most high profile of which is the antituberculosis bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) vaccine, currently in phase iii studies (brace trial, murdoch children’s research institute, australia). the rationale for bcg includes intriguing epidemiologic data suggesting decreased mortality from covid-19 in populations previously exposed to bcg.16escobar l.e. molina-cruz a. barillas-mury c. bcg vaccine protection from severe coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).proc natl acad sci u s a. 2020;

324: 1572crossref scopus (134) google scholar this mandate translates into an approach such that older patients with ibd, patients who are steroid dependent, and those with other established covid-relevant comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, etc) should receive vaccines before other patients. additional factors of consideration will be based on regional prevalence of covid-19 and then, separately, ethnicity and race, recognizing the data of increased risk of infection and adverse outcomes in black and latinx populations. the risk of infection and adverse outcomes should be evaluated in conjunction with practical considerations of access to health care access. nationally, organized updates and a national surveillance plan for sars-cov-2 prevalence will be needed, and in the absence of such organization, local and regional public health officials should guide distribution and provide regular updates. finally, it is essential that we actively address misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccinations in general, and about the new sars-cov-2 vaccines. it is unfortunate that the scientific method and regulatory pathways for medical therapies and vaccines have become politicized and even discarded. we must promote reliable, scientifically rigorous information and consider the public health implications of an effectively vaccinated population. this process will include highlighting limitations to the datasets and advocating on behalf of our patients if there is insufficient information from which to draw conclusions. specifically, we should proactively remind our patients that ibd is not caused or exacerbated by vaccinations, and that the sars-cov-2 vaccines will not have risk of causing covid-19. the information about sars-cov-2 and ibd is evolving rapidly, but there remain many uncertainties and a pressing need for ongoing research. what is the true prevalence of anti–sars-cov-2 in the ibd population and how does that compare with non-ibd populations? a recent study from germany demonstrated low sars-cov-2 seroconversion in anticytokine-exposed patients with immune-mediated conditions, but the reasons for this finding are not known.23simon d. tascilar k. kronke g. et al.patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases receiving cytokine inhibitors have low prevalence of sars-cov-2 seroconversion.nat commun. 2020;

18: 34-40crossref pubmed scopus (73) google scholar so we must ourselves be informed and educated to provide clear, unambiguous messages to our patients and the medical communities in which we practice. first, we should advise all patients with ibd, regardless of immunosuppression, to receive the inactivated influenza vaccination and pneumococcal immunization. we must also be ready to respond to antivaccination tropes and nonscientifically valid arguments against preventive immunizations. second, we should stay apprised of the progress of sars-cov-2 vaccines and anticipate that our patients will look to us for guidance. thus far, we can reassure our patients that the major candidate vaccine mechanisms seem safe for most, if not all, patient populations, but that further clarity may be needed among those who are immunosuppressed. although it is unlikely that any vaccine will be 100% effective against sars-cov-2 transmission, the most effective prevention strategy will include both vaccination and continued hygiene practices, including handwashing and judicious masking and physical distancing. third, we must acknowledge that the initial demand for vaccines will exceed supply, and that a tiered approach to vaccine prioritization is ethically valid. this process will involve prioritizing health care workers as well as vulnerable populations with increased risk for covid-19 complications. finally, we should seek opportunities within the ibd community to enroll patients in postmarketing registries to better understand the effects of sars-cov-2 vaccines on various ibd population profiles and establish evidence to further guide optimal vaccination strategies for our patients with ibd. winter may be coming, but can spring be far behind?25shelley p.b. ode to the west wind. prometheus unbound. c and j ollier, london, england1820google scholar"

argote and ingram 2000; madsen and desai 2010; reeves et al. 2013). productivity gains from learning, termed the “learning curve,” accrue as a decrease in unit production cost as a function of cumulative volume.1 a wealth of literature shows the beneficial effects of learning on long-term costs (arrow 1962; krugman 1987; lucas 1988) and competitive advantage (spence 1981; ghemawat and spence 1985; amit 1986; thompson 2012; leiblein et al. 2021).2 although significant variations in learning rates exist across organizations (dutton and thomas 1984; argote et al. 2021), the underlying reasons for such variations are not well established (edmondson et al. 2001; pisano et al. 2001; e. g. anderson and lewis 2014). we address a question of importance to accounting research and practice—namely, what are the contextual factors that affect learning rates related to cost improvements? contextual factors can influence the opportunity to learn through organizational design, the motivation to learn signaled by the organization's focus on cost efficiency, and the ability to learn through transfer of successful learning routines (argote et al. 2003; dahlin et al. 2018). learning can be either autonomous or induced from elements within and outside the organization (dutton and thomas 1984). autonomous learning occurs on the job, and is often referred to as “learning-by-doing” (adler and clark 1991). autonomous learning yields productivity improvements from task repetition and experience. autonomous learning usually occurs in stable environments and can be augmented by organizational design or adoption of new technology. induced learning, which requires the recalibration of organizational routines, arises from deliberate activities and proactive managerial efforts. induced learning thrives in contexts where the environment is complex, rapidly changing, or uncertain, and tasks are not well defined (wiersma 2007; nembhard and tucker 2011). we study autonomous learning in an industry with immense contemporary relevance, namely, clinical labs. clinical labs conduct health screening, monitoring, and diagnostic testing, and are a critical element of the health-care value chain. in canada, approximately 260 million clinical lab tests were performed annually, while in the united states, over 7 billion clinical lab tests were performed each year before the covid-19 pandemic ballooned the demand for lab testing to greater levels.3 our empirical analyses use data for the period 1997–2015 from clinical labs in california. drawing on learning theory, we model cumulative average hours or cost as a nonlinear function of the cumulative number of units produced (wright 1936; datar and rajan 2017).4 results indicate significant learning rates. we predict and find that, first, outsourcing reduces learning rates because it impedes opportunities to retain and transfer knowledge. second, in labs with a high-quality focus, greater emphasis is given to remedying quality failures, which reduces the motivation to learn about factors that influence cost. third, the ability to learn is strengthened when employees engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (schilling et al. 2003; clark et al. 2018). specifically, product-mix breadth—the number of distinct types of tests—enhances the ability to learn from related task variety. finally, information technology (it) tools augment the ability to learn by facilitating knowledge sharing and the construction of organizational memory repositories. accordingly, we find higher learning rates in labs with it applications encompassing lab management, and employee and task interfaces. overall, we find robust evidence of learning for technical and supervisory labor time and cost, ranging from an 82% to an 88% learning curve.5 we make several contributions. first, while extant research shows the benefits from learning curves (argote 2013; lapré 2011) in new tasks or processes, such as the installation of an assembly line (epple et al. 1996) or introduction of a factory shift (epple et al. 1991), our study calibrates learning curves over almost two decades in a mature industry. we thus add to wiersma (2007) and provide new insights about how learning curves are influenced by contextual factors related to the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn. our study has implications for management accounting, specifically for budgeting and variance analysis. if learning curves are not factored into budgets, efficiency variances will be confounded (steven 1999). to enable appropriate intervention strategies, learning rate variances should be separated from price, volume, or efficiency variances to prevent forecasting errors, distorted budgeted costs, and imprecise efficiency variances (yelle 1979). second, we show that opportunities to learn diminish when activities are not coordinated within organizational boundaries. outsourcing can result in the loss of key organizational knowledge, hamper knowledge retention, and impede coordination routines (reagans et al. 2005). our results add to wiersma (2007), who finds that using temporary employees in the labor mix enhances learning rates. a difference in our setting is that when the lab outsources, the benefits from learning curves accrue to the vendor. in contrast, when the lab keeps the activity in-house (with temporary employees), the benefits from learning curves accrue within the organization. thus, while wiersma shows that the mix of employees is an important driver of learning rates, we show that organizational design in terms of whom the employee works for can influence learning rates. we also show that the organizational context, such as a quality-related focus, can influence the motivation to learn. organizations can enhance their ability to learn through task design and it investments. finally, we contribute to the accounting literature on cost functions. prior research documents asymmetric behavior of cost in response to changes in volume (m. c. anderson et al. 2003) attributed to differences in managerial resource adjustment decisions in declining versus expanding demand (chen et al. 2012; banker and byzalov 2014; banker et al. 2018). cost asymmetry has implications for analyst forecasts (weiss 2010; ciftci et al. 2016), earnings prediction models (banker and chen 2006), and the use of cost signals in fundamental analysis (m. c. anderson et al. 2007). while managerial resource adjustments introduce nonlinearity in short-run cost functions, learning curves represent another form of nonlinearity in short- and long-run cost functions. beginning with the empirical documentation by wright (1936) of a logarithmic pattern of unit cost reduction that occurs with cumulative volume, the learning curve has been a topic of interest in research and practice. learning curves have been documented in a variety of job costing settings, such as aircraft manufacturing (benkard 2000; wright 1936), ships (rapping 1965), technology support (kim et al. 2012), and process costing settings such as petroleum (hirschmann 1964) and chemicals (lieberman 1984). learning curves are theoretically and empirically distinct from economies of scale and managerial adjustment costs. learning curves occur from cumulative experience on the task, while economies of scale occur with a larger current volume. scale economies arise when fixed costs can be spread over a larger number of units (which reduces average cost as volume increases) and from contracting benefits (which reduce marginal costs as volume increases) (scherer and ross 1990). learning curve effects occur with accumulated volume, economies of scale materialize from the current output rate (spence 1981), and adjustment costs result in an asymmetric impact of a change in volume on change in cost.6 learning can be autonomous or induced (dutton and thomas 1984). autonomous learning represents “learning by doing,” where performance improvements occur from task repetition. these improvements are gradual, although they can be influenced by employee characteristics and task properties. autonomous learning is likely in contexts with well-defined tasks that are executed in stable environments and where knowledge growth or technology developments are steady rather than abrupt.7 induced learning results from deliberate activities spurred by external or internal events (sorensen 2002) and occurs in contexts that are not well defined, or where the environment is dynamic. induced learning requires considerable changes to organizational routines (nembhard and tucker 2011). research in organizational learning attests to the beneficial effect of repeated task execution on learning curves (yelle 1979; epple et al. 1996; zollo and winter 2002; boone et al. 2008). experience provides exposure to employees to learn from the knowledge accumulated by other employees, particularly in mature firms where documentation of processes allows the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (argote and miron-spektor 2011; aranda et al. 2017). such learning is widespread in the health-care industry and in common parlance it is described as “practice makes perfect” (gaynor et al. 2005). a variety of settings such as cardiac surgery, radiology, joint replacement, and other intensive care procedures show the effects of learning on procedure times, turnaround times, and error resolution (pisano et al. 2001; edmondson et al. 2003; reagans et al. 2005; huckman and pisano 2006; tucker et al. 2007). while learning is associated with performance improvements in new tasks or processes (adler and clark 1991; epple et al. 1991; epple et al. 1996; pisano et al. 2001), its effect on the cost of mature tasks and processes is understudied (wiersma 2007). clinical laboratory testing is an example of a task that gives employees opportunities for cost reduction as they acquire experience. clinical lab tasks follow a standardized structure and pre-determined process routines, which sets the stage for improvements in productive efficiency by learning from experience. thus, we hypothesize that: hypothesis 1 (h1).the average cumulative direct cost per unit decreases with experience. learning rates vary as a function of the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn provided by the organizational context (argote et al. 2003). contextual factors include organizational design, quality focus, task structures, and resource investments. we discuss the contextual factors in more detail below. knowledge transfer is enhanced when employees have opportunities to learn from each other through observation and interaction (simon 1991; loch et al. 2013). an employee can accumulate knowledge by observing and interacting with proximate colleagues performing the task (borgatti and cross 2003; nadler et al. 2003; see epple and romano 2011 for a review). accordingly, knowledge is more likely to be transferred among employees within the same organization than across organizations (argote et al. 2003; zellmer-bruhn 2003; a. a. kane et al. 2005). on the other hand, outsourcing can cause physical separation of intermediate tasks, which produces coordination problems and impedes knowledge transfers (leavy 1996; e. g. anderson and parker 2002; clement and puranam 2018). lab outsourcing is organized such that certain aspects of clinical laboratory testing move to the external venue of the vendor. for example, quest diagnostics manages portions of lab activities, such as testing, managing supplies, and procurement for its client hospitals. this manner of structuring lab activities reduces opportunities to gain expertise over the entirety of the testing process because the vendor's employees and the lab's employees are unlikely to be co-located, which deters the transfer of tacit knowledge (catalini 2018; s. lee 2019). outsourcing introduces a need to fit the vendor's outputs into the existing lab structure and can disrupt learning. when parts of a lab's activities are outsourced, they generate increased effort to integrate the outsourced component into the existing clinical and business support systems and can impede learning rates.8 integration problems require new task routines and team structures, and change the scope of employees' responsibilities, which negatively affects knowledge transfers (goodman and leyden 1991; pisano et al. 2001; lewis et al. 2007). when different parts of lab activities have heterogenous learning rates, outsourcing can influence learning rates depending on which parts of activities are outsourced. we predict: hypothesis 2 (h2).labs with higher levels of outsourcing have less favorable learning rates, relative to other labs. to learn and transfer knowledge successfully, organizations must aspire to acquire knowledge by identifying efficiency-enhancing combinations to perform an activity and form new routines through a process of deliberate choice and path-dependent trial and error (pisano et al. 2001). learning occurs when organizations have the motivation to search for solutions to existing or anticipated problems and make improvements to routines and capabilities (cyert and march 1963; nelson and winter 1982). this process of learning from the searching for solutions to current and potential future problems is referred to as problemistic search (see posen et al. 2018 for a review). organizations vary in what they set as aspirations, what they consider as “problems,” and what types of problems warrant initiation of problemistic search, and such variations are rooted in the relative importance attached to each of these problems. the search for cost efficiencies is less important in organizations where the prominence is placed on other critical performance dimensions (wiersma 2007). although most organizations give prominence to cost and quality, the degrees of emphasis differ, which has implications for problemistic search and learning curve. problemistic search efforts to identify opportunities to improve cost efficiencies can be impeded when quality improvement takes center stage (cyert and march 1963; kanfer and ackerman 1989; gavetti et al. 2007). in health-care settings, quality is a crucial metric that is the object of medical, public, and regulatory attention for all organizations. the lab testing process is complex, and quality failure in the form of medical errors can occur in patient identification, specimen collection, data entry, storage, and transport. errors can also occur in the post-analytic stage when the test results are interpreted, communicated, and utilized in treatment regimens. the technical specification released by the international organization for standardization (iso/ts 22367, 2008, section 3.1) defines laboratory error as “failure of planned action to be completed as intended, or use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim, occurring at any part of the laboratory cycle, from ordering examinations to reporting results and appropriately interpreting and reacting to them.” hence, an ideal measure to examine the effect of a lab's quality focus on learning rates is a quality metric at the lab level. however, clinical lab quality is difficult to measure because quality-related errors accrue downstream in the patient treatment process. indeed, poor lab quality is a major source of diagnostic errors, with potential catastrophic patient outcomes such as mortality (timbrook et al. 2016). consequently, lab quality is evaluated using a patient-centric approach in terms of any eventual negative impact on the patient (graber 2005; west et al. 2009). moreover, errors in lab testing cannot be fixed through rework, particularly if an error occurs in the post-analytic stage.9 accordingly, labs often have to make trade-offs between quality and cost, and labs with a strong quality focus may be more motivated to engage in quality-related learning and less motivated to engage in cost-related learning. we propose, therefore: hypothesis 3 (h3).quality focus adversely affects learning rates. research indicates that ability to learn is enhanced when organizations engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (clark et al. 2018). high-level abstract knowledge results from participation in related tasks that are bounded within the realm of an overall task know-how or schema. health-care tasks are replete with knowledge structures that are based on interpretive schemata that refer to shared assumptions, values, and frames that “give meaning to everyday activities and guide how organization members think and act” (rerup and feldman 2011, 578). related task variety enhances knowledge about the broader schema or “knowledge construct,” increases absorptive capacity, and enables better learning (schilling et al. 2003; narayanan et al. 2014). in related tasks, the process or content knowledge about any one task is portable and can help in the execution of other tasks (mitchell 2000; wiersma 2007; narayanan et al. 2009), independent of the level of scale or specialization in each activity (march and simon 1958; schilling et al. 2003; clark and huckman 2012). cognitive psychology provides a framework to predict how related task variety influences learning. if a task is organized as a specialized activity in which individuals perform the same task repeatedly, their skill development occurs at the level of the core task. thus, individuals obtain an in-depth understanding of a specific problem. on the other hand, if individuals are exposed to multiple related tasks, they develop abstract knowledge, that is, a schema, about a set of tasks (lapré and nembhard 2010). such learning is conducive to cost efficiency in the health-care industry, which deploys skilled employees in structured environments where knowledge can be synthesized across related domains (clark and huckman 2012). hospitals that cover a wide spectrum of lab testing services enhance the skillset to consider and adjust to “critical covariations in the environment” (reber 1989, 233). thus, we predict the following hypothesis: hypothesis 4 (h4).an increase in related task variety increases learning rates. although learning by doing results in knowledge creation, the ability to transfer such knowledge is constrained when it remains unrecorded. it enhances the ability of organizations to record such experience and retrieve it when needed (levitt and march 1988). for effective learning, new knowledge must be acquired, retained, and transferred. it encourages the automation of routines and avoids the cost involved in cumbersome manual record keeping or human coordination (g. kane and alavi 2007). for example, mukhopadhyay et al. (2011) find that it system upgrades in physician referral systems enhance coordination ability and enable learning. it can facilitate knowledge management, enhance organizational memory, and reduce search costs for efficient inputs (adler et al. 1999; edmondson et al. 2001). standardized templates and reports generated through it increase opportunities for knowledge transfer across employees and workstations. benefits of it tools in managing business opportunities are well documented (kearns and lederer 2003; k. iyengar et al. 2015; mithas and rust 2016; benitez et al. 2018), particularly in health care. in 2001, the institute of medicine stressed the clinical and operational roles of it capability in health-care outcomes including safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, efficiency, and equity. for example, hospitals in china leveraged it infrastructure for covid-19 awareness programs (yan et al. 2020). such programs can be useful in reducing the spread of diseases when society faces a new outbreak. however, substantial cross-sectional variations exist in the extent of investment in it capabilities across health-care organizations. the ability of a health-care organization to derive value from it is a function of munificence—that is, resources invested in it (burke and menachemi 2004). although its benefits percolate to all sectors, it can be valuable in health-care organizations where information creation, retention, retrieval, and dissemination is central (j. lee et al. 2013). even a routine lab test involves coordination of activities across many departments, and delays or errors can have devastating consequences on the health-care value chain. it can be particularly valuable in departments that employ skilled labor and perform routine tasks because it provides the potential to improve workflow, communication, and coordination. for example, business applications such as accounting, billing, and contract management can improve process efficiencies. clinical it systems, such as electronic medical records, can have beneficial effects on costs by reducing duplication. at the lab level, it can integrate functions and technologies such as patient registration systems, generating reports, and analyses of lab performance. therefore, we predict: hypothesis 5 (h5).it investments increase learning rates. the us clinical lab industry generates about 100 billion in annual revenues, employs over 620,000 people, and accounts for about 2% of total health-care costs (acla 2017). laboratory tests are crucial at all stages of medical care including diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, and preventative care. physicians and staff order clinical lab tests for approximately 98% of inpatients and 29% of outpatients (ngo et al. 2017). clinical labs can be hospital-based, physician office-based, or stand-alone entities (e.g., quest diagnostics). about 55% of all medical lab tests are conducted in hospital-based labs (wolcott et al. 2008). the task process begins when a specimen is collected from a patient (fischbach and dunning 2009). the lab technician ascertains that the specimen is appropriate and sends it to the lab where scientific testing occurs. results are transmitted to the physician, who makes a diagnosis. at the pre-analytic stage, a lab technician prepares the patient and collects the specimen. at the analytic stage, a lab technician processes the specimen and generates test results. the lab technician must determine that the test was properly conducted before forwarding the results to the physician for the post-analytic stage. results that are positive for a disease or a medical condition are frequently reanalyzed to reduce false positives. clinical labs employ licensed staff who have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited laboratory science program, passed a certification exam from the american society for clinical pathology (ascp), and have technical anatomical knowledge (e.g., dealing with patients with diabetes), practical knowledge (e.g., which needle to use), and problem-solving knowledge (e.g., prevent excessive bleeding). we use the cumulative average cost model where cost decreases by a constant percentage as the total quantity of units produced is doubled. the cumulative average formulation is a flexible functional form and appropriate for settings such as ours where data are available in historical blocks (wright 1936; miller et al. 2012; mislick and nussbaum 2015). this formulation reduces the measurement error in estimating the learning rate when a long time-series is used. we express the learning curve as ac = a x − b ac=a{x}^{-b} $ , where b is the learning rate or learning index, a is the number of labor hours or cost of producing the first unit, and ac is the cumulative average cost (or cumulative hours per unit) of producing x units.10 data for clinical lab tests for the period 1997–2015 are from the california hospital annual financial disclosure database of the office of state health planning and development (oshpd). the sample includes only hospitals for which audited lab-level data are available on direct and indirect cost pools. our final sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 5,054 lab-year observations for 211 to 297 labs for the period 1997–2015.11 table 1 provides a breakdown of observations used in the analyses. appendix 1 contains variable definitions. appendix 2 contains the location in the oshpd database for each variable. we compute separate learning rates for time and cost for two types of labor: (i) technical labor directly engaged in the testing process and (ii) supervisory and managerial labor overseeing technical labor. labor time (hours per unit) is the natural log of cumulative hours worked by lab technicians (technical hours per unit), or managers and supervisors (supervision hours per unit) in a clinical lab up to and including year t, divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. labor cost (wages per unit) is the natural log of the sum, up to and including year t, of technical hours worked by lab technicians (technical wages per unit) or managers and supervisors (supervision wages per unit) in the lab multiplied by the deflated average hourly wage rate for the corresponding labor pool (lab technicians or supervisors) and divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. learning rates for the aggregate employee cost pool for all the employees working in the clinical lab (salary per unit) is the natural log of deflated total salaries and wages incurred by a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by that lab up to and including year t. this variable (direct cost per unit) is the natural log of cumulative deflated direct expenses of a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. lab direct expenses include lab-specific overheads but exclude allocated hospital-level overheads. notes: the figure shows the difference between the effect of learning curves and economies of scale on cost per unit. economies of scale involve a movement along the average cost curve, whereas learning curve involves a shift in the average cost curve. outsourcing is measured as the natural logarithm of average deflated purchased services in a clinical lab for three years (including the current year) as a percentage

learning curve: evidence from cost behavior in clinical labs* clinical labs belong to a mature industry and fulfill a critical function in the health-care value chain. we examine factors that influence the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn in clinical labs. we hypothesize that with respect to learning about cost: (i) organizational design, such as the extent of outsourcing can impede the opportunity to learn, (ii) quality focus (measured by mortality rates and length of stay (los)) can reduce the motivation to learn, and (iii) related task variety (measured by product-mix breadth) and information technology investments can enhance the ability to learn. our empirical tests calibrate learning effects on disaggregate (technical and supervisory hours and cost) and aggregate (salary and total direct cost) cost and time pools. using longitudinal data from clinical labs in california for the period 1997–2015, we find that clinical labs with greater cumulative output have lower average costs, consistent with learning effects in clinical labs. we also find results consistent with our hypotheses about the contextual factors that influence learning rates in clinical labs. our findings contribute to a better understanding of learning rates with implications for budgeting, forecasting, and performance measurement. the results highlight that learning can be a crucial source of cost reduction in health-care settings. les facteurs qui influencent la courbe d'apprentissage : données relatives à l'évolution des couts dans les laboratoires cliniques les laboratoires cliniques appartiennent à un secteur développé et remplissent une fonction critique dans la chaine de valeur des soins de santé. les auteurs examinent les facteurs qui influencent l'occasion, la motivation et la capacité d'apprendre dans les laboratoires cliniques. en ce qui concerne l'apprentissage en matière de couts, les auteurs émettent l'hypothèse que : (i) le design organisationnel, tel que l'étendue de l'externalisation peut entraver la possibilité d'apprendre, (ii) l'accent mis sur la qualité (mesurée par les taux de mortalité et la durée du séjour) peut réduire la motivation à apprendre, et (iii) la variété des tâches connexes (mesurée par l'étendue de la gamme de produits) et les investissements dans les technologies de l'information peuvent améliorer la capacité à apprendre. les tests empiriques menés par les auteurs étalonnent les effets de l'apprentissage sur des groupes de couts et de temps désagrégés (heures et couts techniques et de supervision) et agrégés (salaire et cout direct total). en utilisant les données longitudinales des laboratoires cliniques en californie pour la période 1997-2015, les auteurs constatent que les laboratoires cliniques avec une plus grande production cumulative ont des couts moyens plus faibles, ce qui est cohérent avec les effets de l'apprentissage dans les laboratoires cliniques. les résultats des auteurs sont aussi conformes à leurs hypothèses sur les facteurs contextuels qui influencent les taux d'apprentissage dans les laboratoires cliniques. leurs conclusions contribuent à une meilleure compréhension des taux d'apprentissage et ont des implications pour la budgétisation, la prévision et la mesure de la performance. les résultats soulignent que l'apprentissage peut être une source cruciale de réduction des couts dans les établissements de soins de santé. in 1968, boston consulting group (bcg) emphasized that long-term competitive gains accrue to those firms where employees learn on the job and organizations facilitate such learning (henderson 1968). decades later, learning continues to be a source of competitive advantage in many industries (cho et al. 1998; argote and ingram 2000; madsen and desai 2010; reeves et al. 2013). productivity gains from learning, termed the “learning curve,” accrue as a decrease in unit production cost as a function of cumulative volume.1 a wealth of literature shows the beneficial effects of learning on long-term costs (arrow 1962; krugman 1987; lucas 1988) and competitive advantage (spence 1981; ghemawat and spence 1985; amit 1986; thompson 2012; leiblein et al. 2021).2 although significant variations in learning rates exist across organizations (dutton and thomas 1984; argote et al. 2021), the underlying reasons for such variations are not well established (edmondson et al. 2001; pisano et al. 2001; e. g. anderson and lewis 2014). we address a question of importance to accounting research and practice—namely, what are the contextual factors that affect learning rates related to cost improvements? contextual factors can influence the opportunity to learn through organizational design, the motivation to learn signaled by the organization's focus on cost efficiency, and the ability to learn through transfer of successful learning routines (argote et al. 2003; dahlin et al. 2018). learning can be either autonomous or induced from elements within and outside the organization (dutton and thomas 1984). autonomous learning occurs on the job, and is often referred to as “learning-by-doing” (adler and clark 1991). autonomous learning yields productivity improvements from task repetition and experience. autonomous learning usually occurs in stable environments and can be augmented by organizational design or adoption of new technology. induced learning, which requires the recalibration of organizational routines, arises from deliberate activities and proactive managerial efforts. induced learning thrives in contexts where the environment is complex, rapidly changing, or uncertain, and tasks are not well defined (wiersma 2007; nembhard and tucker 2011). we study autonomous learning in an industry with immense contemporary relevance, namely, clinical labs. clinical labs conduct health screening, monitoring, and diagnostic testing, and are a critical element of the health-care value chain. in canada, approximately 260 million clinical lab tests were performed annually, while in the united states, over 7 billion clinical lab tests were performed each year before the covid-19 pandemic ballooned the demand for lab testing to greater levels.3 our empirical analyses use data for the period 1997–2015 from clinical labs in california. drawing on learning theory, we model cumulative average hours or cost as a nonlinear function of the cumulative number of units produced (wright 1936; datar and rajan 2017).4 results indicate significant learning rates. we predict and find that, first, outsourcing reduces learning rates because it impedes opportunities to retain and transfer knowledge. second, in labs with a high-quality focus, greater emphasis is given to remedying quality failures, which reduces the motivation to learn about factors that influence cost. third, the ability to learn is strengthened when employees engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (schilling et al. 2003; clark et al. 2018). specifically, product-mix breadth—the number of distinct types of tests—enhances the ability to learn from related task variety. finally, information technology (it) tools augment the ability to learn by facilitating knowledge sharing and the construction of organizational memory repositories. accordingly, we find higher learning rates in labs with it applications encompassing lab management, and employee and task interfaces. overall, we find robust evidence of learning for technical and supervisory labor time and cost, ranging from an 82% to an 88% learning curve.5 we make several contributions. first, while extant research shows the benefits from learning curves (argote 2013; lapré 2011) in new tasks or processes, such as the installation of an assembly line (epple et al. 1996) or introduction of a factory shift (epple et al. 1991), our study calibrates learning curves over almost two decades in a mature industry. we thus add to wiersma (2007) and provide new insights about how learning curves are influenced by contextual factors related to the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn. our study has implications for management accounting, specifically for budgeting and variance analysis. if learning curves are not factored into budgets, efficiency variances will be confounded (steven 1999). to enable appropriate intervention strategies, learning rate variances should be separated from price, volume, or efficiency variances to prevent forecasting errors, distorted budgeted costs, and imprecise efficiency variances (yelle 1979). second, we show that opportunities to learn diminish when activities are not coordinated within organizational boundaries. outsourcing can result in the loss of key organizational knowledge, hamper knowledge retention, and impede coordination routines (reagans et al. 2005). our results add to wiersma (2007), who finds that using temporary employees in the labor mix enhances learning rates. a difference in our setting is that when the lab outsources, the benefits from learning curves accrue to the vendor. in contrast, when the lab keeps the activity in-house (with temporary employees), the benefits from learning curves accrue within the organization. thus, while wiersma shows that the mix of employees is an important driver of learning rates, we show that organizational design in terms of whom the employee works for can influence learning rates. we also show that the organizational context, such as a quality-related focus, can influence the motivation to learn. organizations can enhance their ability to learn through task design and it investments. finally, we contribute to the accounting literature on cost functions. prior research documents asymmetric behavior of cost in response to changes in volume (m. c. anderson et al. 2003) attributed to differences in managerial resource adjustment decisions in declining versus expanding demand (chen et al. 2012; banker and byzalov 2014; banker et al. 2018). cost asymmetry has implications for analyst forecasts (weiss 2010; ciftci et al. 2016), earnings prediction models (banker and chen 2006), and the use of cost signals in fundamental analysis (m. c. anderson et al. 2007). while managerial resource adjustments introduce nonlinearity in short-run cost functions, learning curves represent another form of nonlinearity in short- and long-run cost functions. beginning with the empirical documentation by wright (1936) of a logarithmic pattern of unit cost reduction that occurs with cumulative volume, the learning curve has been a topic of interest in research and practice. learning curves have been documented in a variety of job costing settings, such as aircraft manufacturing (benkard 2000; wright 1936), ships (rapping 1965), technology support (kim et al. 2012), and process costing settings such as petroleum (hirschmann 1964) and chemicals (lieberman 1984). learning curves are theoretically and empirically distinct from economies of scale and managerial adjustment costs. learning curves occur from cumulative experience on the task, while economies of scale occur with a larger current volume. scale economies arise when fixed costs can be spread over a larger number of units (which reduces average cost as volume increases) and from contracting benefits (which reduce marginal costs as volume increases) (scherer and ross 1990). learning curve effects occur with accumulated volume, economies of scale materialize from the current output rate (spence 1981), and adjustment costs result in an asymmetric impact of a change in volume on change in cost.6 learning can be autonomous or induced (dutton and thomas 1984). autonomous learning represents “learning by doing,” where performance improvements occur from task repetition. these improvements are gradual, although they can be influenced by employee characteristics and task properties. autonomous learning is likely in contexts with well-defined tasks that are executed in stable environments and where knowledge growth or technology developments are steady rather than abrupt.7 induced learning results from deliberate activities spurred by external or internal events (sorensen 2002) and occurs in contexts that are not well defined, or where the environment is dynamic. induced learning requires considerable changes to organizational routines (nembhard and tucker 2011). research in organizational learning attests to the beneficial effect of repeated task execution on learning curves (yelle 1979; epple et al. 1996; zollo and winter 2002; boone et al. 2008). experience provides exposure to employees to learn from the knowledge accumulated by other employees, particularly in mature firms where documentation of processes allows the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge (argote and miron-spektor 2011; aranda et al. 2017). such learning is widespread in the health-care industry and in common parlance it is described as “practice makes perfect” (gaynor et al. 2005). a variety of settings such as cardiac surgery, radiology, joint replacement, and other intensive care procedures show the effects of learning on procedure times, turnaround times, and error resolution (pisano et al. 2001; edmondson et al. 2003; reagans et al. 2005; huckman and pisano 2006; tucker et al. 2007). while learning is associated with performance improvements in new tasks or processes (adler and clark 1991; epple et al. 1991; epple et al. 1996; pisano et al. 2001), its effect on the cost of mature tasks and processes is understudied (wiersma 2007). clinical laboratory testing is an example of a task that gives employees opportunities for cost reduction as they acquire experience. clinical lab tasks follow a standardized structure and pre-determined process routines, which sets the stage for improvements in productive efficiency by learning from experience. thus, we hypothesize that: hypothesis 1 (h1).the average cumulative direct cost per unit decreases with experience. learning rates vary as a function of the opportunity, motivation, and ability to learn provided by the organizational context (argote et al. 2003). contextual factors include organizational design, quality focus, task structures, and resource investments. we discuss the contextual factors in more detail below. knowledge transfer is enhanced when employees have opportunities to learn from each other through observation and interaction (simon 1991; loch et al. 2013). an employee can accumulate knowledge by observing and interacting with proximate colleagues performing the task (borgatti and cross 2003; nadler et al. 2003; see epple and romano 2011 for a review). accordingly, knowledge is more likely to be transferred among employees within the same organization than across organizations (argote et al. 2003; zellmer-bruhn 2003; a. a. kane et al. 2005). on the other hand, outsourcing can cause physical separation of intermediate tasks, which produces coordination problems and impedes knowledge transfers (leavy 1996; e. g. anderson and parker 2002; clement and puranam 2018). lab outsourcing is organized such that certain aspects of clinical laboratory testing move to the external venue of the vendor. for example, quest diagnostics manages portions of lab activities, such as testing, managing supplies, and procurement for its client hospitals. this manner of structuring lab activities reduces opportunities to gain expertise over the entirety of the testing process because the vendor's employees and the lab's employees are unlikely to be co-located, which deters the transfer of tacit knowledge (catalini 2018; s. lee 2019). outsourcing introduces a need to fit the vendor's outputs into the existing lab structure and can disrupt learning. when parts of a lab's activities are outsourced, they generate increased effort to integrate the outsourced component into the existing clinical and business support systems and can impede learning rates.8 integration problems require new task routines and team structures, and change the scope of employees' responsibilities, which negatively affects knowledge transfers (goodman and leyden 1991; pisano et al. 2001; lewis et al. 2007). when different parts of lab activities have heterogenous learning rates, outsourcing can influence learning rates depending on which parts of activities are outsourced. we predict: hypothesis 2 (h2).labs with higher levels of outsourcing have less favorable learning rates, relative to other labs. to learn and transfer knowledge successfully, organizations must aspire to acquire knowledge by identifying efficiency-enhancing combinations to perform an activity and form new routines through a process of deliberate choice and path-dependent trial and error (pisano et al. 2001). learning occurs when organizations have the motivation to search for solutions to existing or anticipated problems and make improvements to routines and capabilities (cyert and march 1963; nelson and winter 1982). this process of learning from the searching for solutions to current and potential future problems is referred to as problemistic search (see posen et al. 2018 for a review). organizations vary in what they set as aspirations, what they consider as “problems,” and what types of problems warrant initiation of problemistic search, and such variations are rooted in the relative importance attached to each of these problems. the search for cost efficiencies is less important in organizations where the prominence is placed on other critical performance dimensions (wiersma 2007). although most organizations give prominence to cost and quality, the degrees of emphasis differ, which has implications for problemistic search and learning curve. problemistic search efforts to identify opportunities to improve cost efficiencies can be impeded when quality improvement takes center stage (cyert and march 1963; kanfer and ackerman 1989; gavetti et al. 2007). in health-care settings, quality is a crucial metric that is the object of medical, public, and regulatory attention for all organizations. the lab testing process is complex, and quality failure in the form of medical errors can occur in patient identification, specimen collection, data entry, storage, and transport. errors can also occur in the post-analytic stage when the test results are interpreted, communicated, and utilized in treatment regimens. the technical specification released by the international organization for standardization (iso/ts 22367, 2008, section 3.1) defines laboratory error as “failure of planned action to be completed as intended, or use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim, occurring at any part of the laboratory cycle, from ordering examinations to reporting results and appropriately interpreting and reacting to them.” hence, an ideal measure to examine the effect of a lab's quality focus on learning rates is a quality metric at the lab level. however, clinical lab quality is difficult to measure because quality-related errors accrue downstream in the patient treatment process. indeed, poor lab quality is a major source of diagnostic errors, with potential catastrophic patient outcomes such as mortality (timbrook et al. 2016). consequently, lab quality is evaluated using a patient-centric approach in terms of any eventual negative impact on the patient (graber 2005; west et al. 2009). moreover, errors in lab testing cannot be fixed through rework, particularly if an error occurs in the post-analytic stage.9 accordingly, labs often have to make trade-offs between quality and cost, and labs with a strong quality focus may be more motivated to engage in quality-related learning and less motivated to engage in cost-related learning. we propose, therefore: hypothesis 3 (h3).quality focus adversely affects learning rates. research indicates that ability to learn is enhanced when organizations engage in tasks that are related in terms of knowledge structures (clark et al. 2018). high-level abstract knowledge results from participation in related tasks that are bounded within the realm of an overall task know-how or schema. health-care tasks are replete with knowledge structures that are based on interpretive schemata that refer to shared assumptions, values, and frames that “give meaning to everyday activities and guide how organization members think and act” (rerup and feldman 2011, 578). related task variety enhances knowledge about the broader schema or “knowledge construct,” increases absorptive capacity, and enables better learning (schilling et al. 2003; narayanan et al. 2014). in related tasks, the process or content knowledge about any one task is portable and can help in the execution of other tasks (mitchell 2000; wiersma 2007; narayanan et al. 2009), independent of the level of scale or specialization in each activity (march and simon 1958; schilling et al. 2003; clark and huckman 2012). cognitive psychology provides a framework to predict how related task variety influences learning. if a task is organized as a specialized activity in which individuals perform the same task repeatedly, their skill development occurs at the level of the core task. thus, individuals obtain an in-depth understanding of a specific problem. on the other hand, if individuals are exposed to multiple related tasks, they develop abstract knowledge, that is, a schema, about a set of tasks (lapré and nembhard 2010). such learning is conducive to cost efficiency in the health-care industry, which deploys skilled employees in structured environments where knowledge can be synthesized across related domains (clark and huckman 2012). hospitals that cover a wide spectrum of lab testing services enhance the skillset to consider and adjust to “critical covariations in the environment” (reber 1989, 233). thus, we predict the following hypothesis: hypothesis 4 (h4).an increase in related task variety increases learning rates. although learning by doing results in knowledge creation, the ability to transfer such knowledge is constrained when it remains unrecorded. it enhances the ability of organizations to record such experience and retrieve it when needed (levitt and march 1988). for effective learning, new knowledge must be acquired, retained, and transferred. it encourages the automation of routines and avoids the cost involved in cumbersome manual record keeping or human coordination (g. kane and alavi 2007). for example, mukhopadhyay et al. (2011) find that it system upgrades in physician referral systems enhance coordination ability and enable learning. it can facilitate knowledge management, enhance organizational memory, and reduce search costs for efficient inputs (adler et al. 1999; edmondson et al. 2001). standardized templates and reports generated through it increase opportunities for knowledge transfer across employees and workstations. benefits of it tools in managing business opportunities are well documented (kearns and lederer 2003; k. iyengar et al. 2015; mithas and rust 2016; benitez et al. 2018), particularly in health care. in 2001, the institute of medicine stressed the clinical and operational roles of it capability in health-care outcomes including safety, effectiveness, patient centeredness, efficiency, and equity. for example, hospitals in china leveraged it infrastructure for covid-19 awareness programs (yan et al. 2020). such programs can be useful in reducing the spread of diseases when society faces a new outbreak. however, substantial cross-sectional variations exist in the extent of investment in it capabilities across health-care organizations. the ability of a health-care organization to derive value from it is a function of munificence—that is, resources invested in it (burke and menachemi 2004). although its benefits percolate to all sectors, it can be valuable in health-care organizations where information creation, retention, retrieval, and dissemination is central (j. lee et al. 2013). even a routine lab test involves coordination of activities across many departments, and delays or errors can have devastating consequences on the health-care value chain. it can be particularly valuable in departments that employ skilled labor and perform routine tasks because it provides the potential to improve workflow, communication, and coordination. for example, business applications such as accounting, billing, and contract management can improve process efficiencies. clinical it systems, such as electronic medical records, can have beneficial effects on costs by reducing duplication. at the lab level, it can integrate functions and technologies such as patient registration systems, generating reports, and analyses of lab performance. therefore, we predict: hypothesis 5 (h5).it investments increase learning rates. the us clinical lab industry generates about 100 billion in annual revenues, employs over 620,000 people, and accounts for about 2% of total health-care costs (acla 2017). laboratory tests are crucial at all stages of medical care including diagnosis, treatment, follow-up care, and preventative care. physicians and staff order clinical lab tests for approximately 98% of inpatients and 29% of outpatients (ngo et al. 2017). clinical labs can be hospital-based, physician office-based, or stand-alone entities (e.g., quest diagnostics). about 55% of all medical lab tests are conducted in hospital-based labs (wolcott et al. 2008). the task process begins when a specimen is collected from a patient (fischbach and dunning 2009). the lab technician ascertains that the specimen is appropriate and sends it to the lab where scientific testing occurs. results are transmitted to the physician, who makes a diagnosis. at the pre-analytic stage, a lab technician prepares the patient and collects the specimen. at the analytic stage, a lab technician processes the specimen and generates test results. the lab technician must determine that the test was properly conducted before forwarding the results to the physician for the post-analytic stage. results that are positive for a disease or a medical condition are frequently reanalyzed to reduce false positives. clinical labs employ licensed staff who have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited laboratory science program, passed a certification exam from the american society for clinical pathology (ascp), and have technical anatomical knowledge (e.g., dealing with patients with diabetes), practical knowledge (e.g., which needle to use), and problem-solving knowledge (e.g., prevent excessive bleeding). we use the cumulative average cost model where cost decreases by a constant percentage as the total quantity of units produced is doubled. the cumulative average formulation is a flexible functional form and appropriate for settings such as ours where data are available in historical blocks (wright 1936; miller et al. 2012; mislick and nussbaum 2015). this formulation reduces the measurement error in estimating the learning rate when a long time-series is used. we express the learning curve as ac = a x − b ac=a{x}^{-b} $ , where b is the learning rate or learning index, a is the number of labor hours or cost of producing the first unit, and ac is the cumulative average cost (or cumulative hours per unit) of producing x units.10 data for clinical lab tests for the period 1997–2015 are from the california hospital annual financial disclosure database of the office of state health planning and development (oshpd). the sample includes only hospitals for which audited lab-level data are available on direct and indirect cost pools. our final sample consists of an unbalanced panel of 5,054 lab-year observations for 211 to 297 labs for the period 1997–2015.11 table 1 provides a breakdown of observations used in the analyses. appendix 1 contains variable definitions. appendix 2 contains the location in the oshpd database for each variable. we compute separate learning rates for time and cost for two types of labor: (i) technical labor directly engaged in the testing process and (ii) supervisory and managerial labor overseeing technical labor. labor time (hours per unit) is the natural log of cumulative hours worked by lab technicians (technical hours per unit), or managers and supervisors (supervision hours per unit) in a clinical lab up to and including year t, divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. labor cost (wages per unit) is the natural log of the sum, up to and including year t, of technical hours worked by lab technicians (technical wages per unit) or managers and supervisors (supervision wages per unit) in the lab multiplied by the deflated average hourly wage rate for the corresponding labor pool (lab technicians or supervisors) and divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. learning rates for the aggregate employee cost pool for all the employees working in the clinical lab (salary per unit) is the natural log of deflated total salaries and wages incurred by a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by that lab up to and including year t. this variable (direct cost per unit) is the natural log of cumulative deflated direct expenses of a clinical lab up to and including year t divided by the cumulative number of clinical tests conducted by the lab up to and including year t. lab direct expenses include lab-specific overheads but exclude allocated hospital-level overheads. notes: the figure shows the difference between the effect of learning curves and economies of scale on cost per unit. economies of scale involve a movement along the average cost curve, whereas learning curve involves a shift in the average cost curve. outsourcing is measured as the natural logarithm of average deflated purchased services in a clinical lab for three years (including the current year) as a percentage of"

spreading in countries with fragile health systems. although countries like india, philippines, thailand and nepal have reported their first confirmed cases of the sars-cov-2 virus in january, widespread community spread have not been reported. contrary to such justified expectations/predictions, on 13 march 2020, who declared europe as the epicentre of the pandemic. even though we are still in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the disproportionately smaller number of cases reported from disadvantaged/low-income countries remains puzzling. we hypothesize that general bcg vaccination policies adopted by different countries might have impacted the transmission patterns and/or covid-19-associated morbidity and mortality. vaccines provide protection to a particular pathogen by inducing effector mechanisms directed to that pathogen. however, certain attenuated vaccines like the bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) can also protect against unrelated pathogens, some of which cause acute respiratory tract infections.1,s1-s6 the underlying mechanism for the bcg vaccination-induced non-specific protection is thought to be mediated via the induction of innate immune memory, or “trained immunity,” as was first proposed by netea and collaborators.2 trained immunity-inducing agents reprogramme bone marrow haematopietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors through epigenetic and metabolic changes, resulting in a more robust response in differentiated innate immune cells, following encounter with a pathogen.s7-s8 of interest, in a randomized placebo-controlled human study, bcg vaccination was demonstrated to induce epigenetic reprogramming in monocytes, conferring protection against experimental infection with an attenuated yellow fever virus vaccine strain.3 based on these observations, we hypothesized that countries who continue bcg immunization programmes would contain the spread of this new coronavirus better than those who did not have or have ceased their national bcg vaccination programmes. to check the validity of this hypothesis, we compared the number of cases and deaths per million people from all countries with at least 500 (23 march) or 1000 cases (29 and 31 march) according to their bcg vaccination status (figure 1a, b and figure s1 (for updated data from 6 april) and table s1). cases/million in countries with a national bcg vaccination programme were statistically significantly lower than those who did not have/ have ceased their national bcg vaccination programmes (p < .0001). we also compared the number of deaths per million. results showed that covid-19-associated deaths relative to the size of the population were significantly lower in countries with a national bcg vaccination programme than those without bcg vaccination (p < .0058 and p < .0001 for 23, 29 and 31 march, respectively). to correct for different stages of the spread of disease, we downloaded the data showing the total confirmed deaths since the 5th death from our world in data website (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-deaths-since-5th-death). instead of the 5th death as day 0, we chose the 100th death as day 0. the total deaths on 14th or 20th day after the 100th death were divided by the population of each country to obtain deaths/million. all countries that had data on these days were included, and the comparison between the bcg-vaccinated and bcg-unvaccinated populations was made (figure 1c). using this “disease stage normalized” data, there was still a highly significant difference between countries that adhered to national bcg vaccination policy vs those that had ceases/never had a national programme (figure 1c). if bcg vaccination has a general non-specific protective effect against spread of sars-cov-2 or covid-19-associated morbidity and mortality, then bcg re-vaccination of populations offer a viable alternative of partial protection until a specific vaccine is available. the duration of bcg-induced trained immunity or how different vaccine strains compare in terms of longevity of induced innate memory is not known. work by netea et al show that the “trained immunity status” is maintained for at least a year (the maximum time point they measured).s9 bcg-induced protection against tuberculosis lasts for approximately 20 years and wanes thereafter.s10 if one assumes that bcg-induced non-specific protective effect also lasts for 20 years and gradually wanes, then there should be a difference between countries that have stopped bcg vaccination earlier vs later. to assess this possibility, we analysed data from 13 european countries that have ceased their national bcg vaccination programmes (table s2). according to this, 5 countries (norway, france, finland, uk and germany) had ceased vaccination in the last 2 decades, whereas 8 countries had dropped national bcg vaccination in the last 3-4 decades (austria, belgium, switzerland, denmark, spain, netherlands and sweden) or had no national coverage (italy, represented with an arbitrary value of 50). we then downloaded the data representing the daily confirmed covid-19 deaths per million people from our world in data website (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-daily-deaths-trajectory-per-million) for these 13 countries (summarized in table s3). we chose the deaths/million on day 7 of the epidemic (highlighted in bold in the table s3) as the time point to compare the deaths/million between countries (ie before their health infrastructure was possibly overwhelmed). our results demonstrated a statistically significant difference in deaths/million on day 7 since the daily confirmed deaths reached 0.1/million (mann-whitney u test; p = .0109) between countries that had ceased vaccination in the last 2 vs the last 3-4 decades (figure 1d). this result suggests that bcg vaccination-induced heterologous non-specific protective effect could be of long-lasting duration ( 20 years) and therefore could potentially impact the dynamics of sars-cov-2-associated community spread and/or disease severity. there is also the question of which bcg vaccine strain to choose. the bcg vaccine strains used by different countries vary widely. bcg vaccine was first introduced in 1921, and the seed cultures were distributed to various countries. during their passage, bcg strains accumulated genomic alterations, including deletions, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and duplications, leading to the emergence of several substrains.4 based on their tandem duplication variants (du2), bcg vaccines fall into 4 groups (figure 2b). the du2-i and du2-ii groups consists of “early” bcg vaccine strains (japan, russia and moreau/brazil), whereas du2-iii and du2-iv are considered as more distant “late” vaccine strains (like pasteur, denmark and connaught).4 the strains differ in terms of their growth characteristics, biochemistry, immunogenicity and virulence. the late bcg strains are defective in production of cell wall methoxymycolic acids and possess only the alpha and ketomycolic acids.5 consistent with this, early bcg strains persist up to 6 months in the mesenteric lymph nodes of vaccinated children, whereas no live bacteria could be detected in late strain vaccines. similarly, methoxymycolate-producing early strains are more potent immunostimulating agents than the late strains.6 mycolic acids can condition macrophages to produce higher levels of ifn-γ, myeloperoxidase and tnf-α upon renewed exposure to innate triggers.7 accordingly, mycolic acids constitute an important group of ligands capable of inducing trained immunity. methoxymycolic acids are inflammatory and can activate macrophages, whereas ketomycolic acids promote anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated macrophages.7 since the persistence and immunostimulatory properties of bcg strains differ, their potential to induce trained immunity in vaccinated individuals could also vary. when we analysed available data on bcg vaccine strains used in different countries (figure 2a, modified from references 8 and 9), iran and china emerged as local producers of their own vaccines. evidence suggests that the bcg vaccine strain in iran is bcg-pasteur 1173p2s11 and the one in china is a strain derived from glaxo 1077,s12 representing the most modified and highly attenuated strains deficient of methoxymycolic acids when compared to the japan and russia strains. it is conceivable that the trained immunity induced by the iran and china bcg vaccine strains are short-lived compared to older strains widely utilized by other countries. the lower than expected number of cases detected in countries in asia and africa with extensive travel and trade links with china might stem from the bcg immunization-induced heterologous protective activity of the vaccine. should this hypothesis hold its ground, then there would be important repercussions that could save lives. since bcg vaccination was previously demonstrated to prevent acute respiratory tract infections even in the elderly, until a specific vaccine is developed, the results of clinical trials testing for bcg vaccine as defence against sars-cov-2 could be critical in the fight against the new coronavirus pandemic (list of ongoing/planned clinical trials are provided in table s4). we thank

they induce the secretion of antiviral molecules and place uninfected cells in a transient antiviral state. this type of defense is useful and decisive especially in the early phase of the infection, but in the late phase an excessive interferon response should induce to the cytokine release syndrome. it is therefore conceivable that the epigenetic upgrade of monocyte-macrophage line may favor a more effective interferon response, with an immediate resolution of the infectious process. another of the escape mechanisms of sars-cov2 should seem to be the inhibition of the natural killer cells, with consequent decrease of th1 response (reduction of il-12, il-15, il-18) and with reduction of the direct cytotoxic action of the infected cells. the improved response capacity of these enhanced cells seems to be linked essentially to specific cytokine secretion profiles that promote a more effective elimination of any infection;

promoters of cytokine genes are de-phased or de novo created. excluding any influence due to pollution and/or climate change,8 this epigenetic remodeling is maintained even after the disappearance of the primary stimulus (""nonspecific immunological memory of the antigen""), giving the cell the ability to respond more powerfully to the next stimulus, although not related to previous stimuli. in sars-cov infection (to verify for sars-cov-2 infection), type i interferons, by macrophages/monocytes, represent a fundamental mechanism of protection from viral infections;

vaccination seems to selectively protect adult males from covid‐19 infection","Allergy",NA,"0105-4538","10.1111/all.15186","https://doi.org/10.1111/all.15186","many studies have suggested a beneficial, non-specific effect of the now 100-year-old bacille calmette-guérin (bcg) vaccine on child mortality due to a reduction in neonatal sepsis and respiratory tract infections as well as protection against various specific viral diseases.1-6 two mechanisms have been demonstrated by which non-specific protection against unrelated pathogens is thought to occur: (i) epigenetic training of macrophages and natural killer (nk) cells and (ii) heterologous t helper 1 (th1) and th17 immune responses.7 in the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic, some countries had a substantially lower mortality and morbidity due to sars-cov-2. early on, some ecological studies concluded that bcg vaccination might be one of the underlying causes of the observed difference between countries, while others did not find such a correlation.3, 4, 8, 9 we used a case-control design to investigate whether bcg vaccination during childhood affects the risk of covid-19-infection in adults. the study was conducted in east germany at a time of the covid-19 pandemic before the so-called ‘variants of concern’ emerged in our region. we took advantage of a federally imposed contact tracing system in germany to selectively include uniformly defined close contacts of covid-19-infected persons thereby having a comparable risk of covid-19-transmission. close contacts were considered cases if they had a positive sars-cov-2-pcr test and/or if sars-cov-2-specific antibody testing—which was performed at least three weeks after contact—returned a positive result. bcg vaccination status was individually assessed under consideration of vaccination certificates and additional supportive parameters by a medical professional (appendix s1). 800 persons were invited (response rate 28.9%). due to rigorous bcg vaccination policy in east germany until the year 1990, age-adjusted analysis could not be conducted for older age groups due to the lack of bcg-non-vaccinated participants. 147 of 190 included individuals from 17 to 46 years of age were therefore selected for final analysis to form three age groups (17–26, 27–36 and 37–46). there were 87 females (59.2%) and 60 males (40.8%) (table 1). likelihood ratio tests performed to test for interaction by sex and age yielded a p value of 0.015 and 0.79, respectively, indicating that the association between bcg status and covid-19 infection was modified by sex but not by age. therefore, a final model of the relationship between bcg vaccination and covid-19 infections was fitted that included age as a confounder and sex as an effect modifier. bcg vaccination status was associated with a lower likelihood of covid-19 infection for men but not for women (ors 0.13 and 1.04, respectively). for men, we found a highly significant association with 95% cis ranging from 0.04 to 0.48 (p = 0.002), while for women, 95% cis ranged from 0.40 to 2.71 (p = 0.938) (table 2). grossly, we observed comparatively more infected bcg-non-vaccinated males and fewer infected bcg-vaccinated males than females which resulted in a roughly balanced distribution of covid-19 infections between males and females in our study (or: 1.06, 95% ci 0.53–2.09 p = 0.876). bcg vaccination might differentially affect men by turning them from a natural state of being at higher risk of covid-19 infection to a state of being at lower risk compared with women. bacille calmette-guérin vaccination status did not seem to affect covid-19-related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, joint pains, fatigue, dry cough and loss of smell), and no correlation between impact of symptoms on state of health and bcg vaccination status was found (overall estimate and conducted separately for males and females and two age groups [≤30 and >30 years of age] using chi-squared test and fisher's exact test as appropriate, appendix s1). a cross-sectional study conducted in los angeles found evidence of a protective effect of bcg vaccination but did not mention results from sex-stratified analysis.10 bcg vaccination was never part of the us routine vaccination programme. a case-control study from canada evaluated covid-19-related health outcomes for bcg-vaccinated and bcg-non-vaccinated born between 1956 and 1976 and did not find evidence of a protective effect from bcg vaccination.11 participants in the present study tended to be much younger limiting comparability. epidemiological investigations of sex-dependent differences in non-specific effects of bcg vaccination are scarce. a randomized trial (rct) found that non-specific effects of bcg vaccination concerning all-cause mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period differed between males and females in the first weeks of life.5 a case-control study on children <5 years of age in guinea-bissau found a protective effect of bcg vaccination against acute lower respiratory tract infection, especially caused by respiratory syncytial virus, that was most marked in girls.2 in contrast, a case-control study conducted in kenya found a statistically significant reduction in community-acquired pneumonia in bcg-vaccinated males (study population: 15–54 years of age), while no effect was present in women.6 the longevity of non-specific effects of bcg vaccination is not clear; however, monocytes stimulated with the tlr4 ligand lipopolysaccharide a year after bcg vaccination showed an increased expression of pattern recognition receptors such as cd14, toll-like receptors (tlr4) and mannose receptor correlating with increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. similarly, heterologous immune responses with th1 expressing ifn-γ and th17 expressing il-17 and il-22 upon stimulation remained highly elevated a year after bcg vaccination.7 the impact of bcg vaccination on systemic inflammation and cytokine responses to re-stimulation has been investigated by koeken, netea and collaborators. higher pre-vaccination levels and lower post-vaccination levels of inflammatory proteins were found in males. ex vivo pbmc-derived cytokine production upon re-stimulation (14 and 90 days after vaccination) was then investigated, and strong sex-depended correlations with baseline (pre-vaccination) circulating inflammatory protein levels were found. high levels of pre-vaccination inflammatory proteins were associated with increased ifn-γ production upon re-stimulation in males.12 very recently, homology between several sars-cov-2 peptides and peptides from bcg has been demonstrated. in a recent in vitro experiment, cd4+ and cd8+ cells primed with bcg-derived peptides developed enhanced reactivity to their corresponding homologous sars-cov-2-derived peptides. bcg-vaccinated individuals exhibited across all peptides showed a trend towards increased tnf and inf-γ responses in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. crucially, the participants had been bcg-vaccinated years before stimulation.13 in light of sex dependencies with respect to ifn-γ release after bcg vaccination and the recent evidence for t cell cross-reactivity between bcg and sars-cov-2-derived peptides, a mechanism involving heterologous immune responses mediated by th1 cells could be hypothesized. as the effect seen in the present study was limited to covid-19 infection with no influence on symptoms, instantaneous defence mechanisms such as pattern recognition receptors

calmette‐guérin vaccination seems to selectively protect adult males from covid‐19 infection many studies have suggested a beneficial, non-specific effect of the now 100-year-old bacille calmette-guérin (bcg) vaccine on child mortality due to a reduction in neonatal sepsis and respiratory tract infections as well as protection against various specific viral diseases.1-6 two mechanisms have been demonstrated by which non-specific protection against unrelated pathogens is thought to occur: (i) epigenetic training of macrophages and natural killer (nk) cells and (ii) heterologous t helper 1 (th1) and th17 immune responses.7 in the first wave of the covid-19 pandemic, some countries had a substantially lower mortality and morbidity due to sars-cov-2. early on, some ecological studies concluded that bcg vaccination might be one of the underlying causes of the observed difference between countries, while others did not find such a correlation.3, 4, 8, 9 we used a case-control design to investigate whether bcg vaccination during childhood affects the risk of covid-19-infection in adults. the study was conducted in east germany at a time of the covid-19 pandemic before the so-called ‘variants of concern’ emerged in our region. we took advantage of a federally imposed contact tracing system in germany to selectively include uniformly defined close contacts of covid-19-infected persons thereby having a comparable risk of covid-19-transmission. close contacts were considered cases if they had a positive sars-cov-2-pcr test and/or if sars-cov-2-specific antibody testing—which was performed at least three weeks after contact—returned a positive result. bcg vaccination status was individually assessed under consideration of vaccination certificates and additional supportive parameters by a medical professional (appendix s1). 800 persons were invited (response rate 28.9%). due to rigorous bcg vaccination policy in east germany until the year 1990, age-adjusted analysis could not be conducted for older age groups due to the lack of bcg-non-vaccinated participants. 147 of 190 included individuals from 17 to 46 years of age were therefore selected for final analysis to form three age groups (17–26, 27–36 and 37–46). there were 87 females (59.2%) and 60 males (40.8%) (table 1). likelihood ratio tests performed to test for interaction by sex and age yielded a p value of 0.015 and 0.79, respectively, indicating that the association between bcg status and covid-19 infection was modified by sex but not by age. therefore, a final model of the relationship between bcg vaccination and covid-19 infections was fitted that included age as a confounder and sex as an effect modifier. bcg vaccination status was associated with a lower likelihood of covid-19 infection for men but not for women (ors 0.13 and 1.04, respectively). for men, we found a highly significant association with 95% cis ranging from 0.04 to 0.48 (p = 0.002), while for women, 95% cis ranged from 0.40 to 2.71 (p = 0.938) (table 2). grossly, we observed comparatively more infected bcg-non-vaccinated males and fewer infected bcg-vaccinated males than females which resulted in a roughly balanced distribution of covid-19 infections between males and females in our study (or: 1.06, 95% ci 0.53–2.09 p = 0.876). bcg vaccination might differentially affect men by turning them from a natural state of being at higher risk of covid-19 infection to a state of being at lower risk compared with women. bacille calmette-guérin vaccination status did not seem to affect covid-19-related symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, joint pains, fatigue, dry cough and loss of smell), and no correlation between impact of symptoms on state of health and bcg vaccination status was found (overall estimate and conducted separately for males and females and two age groups [≤30 and >30 years of age] using chi-squared test and fisher's exact test as appropriate, appendix s1). a cross-sectional study conducted in los angeles found evidence of a protective effect of bcg vaccination but did not mention results from sex-stratified analysis.10 bcg vaccination was never part of the us routine vaccination programme. a case-control study from canada evaluated covid-19-related health outcomes for bcg-vaccinated and bcg-non-vaccinated born between 1956 and 1976 and did not find evidence of a protective effect from bcg vaccination.11 participants in the present study tended to be much younger limiting comparability. epidemiological investigations of sex-dependent differences in non-specific effects of bcg vaccination are scarce. a randomized trial (rct) found that non-specific effects of bcg vaccination concerning all-cause mortality and morbidity in the neonatal period differed between males and females in the first weeks of life.5 a case-control study on children <5 years of age in guinea-bissau found a protective effect of bcg vaccination against acute lower respiratory tract infection, especially caused by respiratory syncytial virus, that was most marked in girls.2 in contrast, a case-control study conducted in kenya found a statistically significant reduction in community-acquired pneumonia in bcg-vaccinated males (study population: 15–54 years of age), while no effect was present in women.6 the longevity of non-specific effects of bcg vaccination is not clear; however, monocytes stimulated with the tlr4 ligand lipopolysaccharide a year after bcg vaccination showed an increased expression of pattern recognition receptors such as cd14, toll-like receptors (tlr4) and mannose receptor correlating with increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production. similarly, heterologous immune responses with th1 expressing ifn-γ and th17 expressing il-17 and il-22 upon stimulation remained highly elevated a year after bcg vaccination.7 the impact of bcg vaccination on systemic inflammation and cytokine responses to re-stimulation has been investigated by koeken, netea and collaborators. higher pre-vaccination levels and lower post-vaccination levels of inflammatory proteins were found in males. ex vivo pbmc-derived cytokine production upon re-stimulation (14 and 90 days after vaccination) was then investigated, and strong sex-depended correlations with baseline (pre-vaccination) circulating inflammatory protein levels were found. high levels of pre-vaccination inflammatory proteins were associated with increased ifn-γ production upon re-stimulation in males.12 very recently, homology between several sars-cov-2 peptides and peptides from bcg has been demonstrated. in a recent in vitro experiment, cd4+ and cd8+ cells primed with bcg-derived peptides developed enhanced reactivity to their corresponding homologous sars-cov-2-derived peptides. bcg-vaccinated individuals exhibited across all peptides showed a trend towards increased tnf and inf-γ responses in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. crucially, the participants had been bcg-vaccinated years before stimulation.13 in light of sex dependencies with respect to ifn-γ release after bcg vaccination and the recent evidence for t cell cross-reactivity between bcg and sars-cov-2-derived peptides, a mechanism involving heterologous immune responses mediated by th1 cells could be hypothesized. as the effect seen in the present study was limited to covid-19 infection with no influence on symptoms, instantaneous defence mechanisms such as pattern recognition receptors suitable to prevent infection differentially expressed by bcg-vaccinated males might play a role but cannot be elucidated from the evidence currently available. adjustment for confounding factors other than age and sex was impeded by the study's limited sample size. analysis of effect modification by age was affected by the strong correlation between age and bcg vaccination status in our study population, limiting any inferences about the longevity of the effect of bcg vaccination of covid-19 infections. notwithstanding these limitations, we believe that this study contributes to the emerging picture of a protective effect of childhood bcg vaccination on covid-19 infection at a time, at which many countries struggle to scale up covid-19 vaccination programmes. the selective protective effect on males found in this study could broaden the understanding of covid-19 infection dynamics with possible use to implementation of covid-19-related public health measures. urgently needed further research will be challenging as increasing covid-19 vaccine coverage

(for further information see additional background text in the long version.) in contrast, ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab are all targeted therapies approved not only for the treatment of psoriasis, but also for the treatment of crohn’s disease and, in the case of adalimumab, infliximab and ustekinumab, ulcerative colitis; dosages may vary between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). notably, the anti-tnf fusion protein etanercept failed in clinical trials in crohn’s disease [18]. there is an ongoing phase ii/iii clinical development program for the il-23p19 inhibitors guselkumab and risankizumab in crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. in the case of risankizumab, positive clinical effects have been published for the induction and long term treatment of patients with crohn’s disease [19, 20] and are supported by immunological findings in the intestinal mucosa of patients with crohn’s disease receiving the drug [21]. there are several published case reports on the successful use of guselkumab in patients with crohn’s disease [22, 23]. due to their intestinal side effect profile with a relatively frequent induction of abdominal pain, loose stools and diarrhea, fumarates should not be used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). severe gastrointestinal diseases are listed as contraindication in the prescription information of fumaderm® and skilarence®. inhibition of pde4 with apremilast has shown positive effects in a phase ii trial with ulcerative colitis [24]. methotrexate has limited efficacy in crohn’s disease [25, 26] and probably even less in ulcerative colitis [27, 28], but there is a considerable body of experience and no signal for a worsening of these conditions. acitretin may be considered neutral in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease and has been used in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease that developed psoriasiform lesions (including cases of so called paradoxical psoriasis) during treatment with tnf antagonist [29]. ciclosporin (csa) is frequently used in the treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis and has demonstrated long term outcomes similar to those of infliximab [30]. in patients with psoriasis and active ibd or a history of ibd, we recommend preferentially using approved targeted therapies with a documented efficacy in these conditions: crohn’s disease: anti-tnf (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) and anti-il-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). ulcerative colitis: anti-tnf (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-il-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). if these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice targeted treatment options in patients with psoriasis and ibd: crohn’s disease: anti-il-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) ulcerative colitis: anti-il-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) if these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice oral treatment options in patients with psoriasis and ibd: crohn’s disease: methotrexate. active ulcerative colitis: ciclosporin (preferred), apremilast (also possible). this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) some studies have studied the possible association of the use of systemic therapies for psoriasis and incident cancer (in patients without previous history of cancer). a systematic review of rcts and observational studies exploring the risk of cancer in psoriasis patients treated with biologics described an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in those patients being treated with anti-tnfs. however, included studies lacked adjustment for highly relevant confounding factors such as prior phototherapy. data on other cancers do not show a risk associated with exposure to drugs. however, the studies are likely to be underpowered to ascertain the risk of individual types of cancer [31]. vaengebjerg et al. did not find increased risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on biologics compared with other systemic therapies [32]. there are also some studies describing the risk of cancer associated with systemic therapy for other immune-mediated disorders, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, other rheumatic disorders and inflammatory bowel disease. results in these disorders might not be appropriately extrapolated to psoriasis patients, as psoriatic patients receive less immunosuppressive therapy (specially corticosteroids) and the associated disorders are different [33]. most studies are reassuring and did not find a relationship between exposure to anti-tnfs and risk of incident cancer in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis [34]. luo et al., analyzing data from nine cohorts, described an increased risk of cancer in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, which was not seen in patients receiving biologics. however, this increase was due to nonmelanoma skin cancer (nmsc) and included studies have not considered the likely effect of previous puva therapy [35]. summary of product characteristics (smpcs) of tnf inhibitors contain information regarding the risk of lymphoma/leukemia. however, these are rare events and data supporting this association are conflicting. so far, no such association have been shown for psoriasis patients [31]. few studies provide information that is relevant for answering this question. regarding patients with precancerous conditions (data available only for cervical dysplasia), a study using routine data of women with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), describe that initiation of therapy with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bdmard) was associated with an increased, but not statistically significant, risk of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer compared to initiation of a nonbiological (nb)dmard [36]. conversely, a review analyzing 238 women with ra and a history of cervical carcinoma in situ, no genital cancer was observed in the tnf inhibitor (tnfi)-treated group over a median of 5.2 years of follow-up compared with two incidents of genital cancer in the nbdmard-treated group, during a median follow-up of 3.9 years [37]. a systematic review of studies of patients with a history of cancer and exposed to anti-tnf therapy assessing for the risk of the occurrence of new cancer or cancer re-occurrence compared to nbdmards, included nine studies with 11,679 patients. none of them were studies on psoriasis. the outcome measures were heterogeneous, with many studies focused on describing nmsc. overall, the study did not find an increased risk of recurrence in patients treated with anti-tnfs compared to nbdmards [38]. a retrospective study, based on routine data, of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and a previous nmsc, described an increased risk of a second nmsc in patients treated with methotrexate that was higher with longer exposures. anti-tnf use was also associated with an increased risk, mostly in a subgroup (patients with ra and concomitant use of methotrexate) [39]. another systematic review analyzed the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with immune-mediated diseases exposed to immune-suppressive therapies. they included 16 observational studies with 11,702 participants after a cancer diagnosis and with 1,698 new or recurrent cases of cancer. only one very small study, and not contributing to the final analysis, was focused on psoriasis patients. overall, rates of cancer recurrence were similar among participants receiving anti-tnf therapy, immune-modulator therapy or no immunosuppression, but was higher among patients receiving combination immune suppression [40]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for patients with recent malignancy we recommend topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band uvb)* and/or acitretin. *except patients with a recent and/or high risk of cutaneous malignancy. in case of inadequate response to topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band uvb), and/or acitretin we suggest using mtx in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer. **for patients with history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, see background text. we suggest anti-tnf or ustekinumab can be used based on existing safety data on a case-by-case basis including discussion with cancer specialist. we suggest anti-il17 or anti il23 can be used in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer despite the lack of long-term experience based on pathophysiological considerations on a case-by-case basis including discussion with a cancer specialist. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. psoriasis is associated with a higher risk for psychiatric comorbidities including anxiety and depression while results on suicide ideation and suicide are more unclear [12, 41–44]. in general, interventions that are effective for psoriasis correspondingly also improve symptoms of depression. clinical studies using adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab or fumarates for the treatment of psoriasis have shown that all these anti-inflammatory drugs not only improve psoriatic manifestations, but also symptoms of depression [43, 45–50]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) acitretin has been reported to be associated with depression in some case reports [51, 52]. however, more recent reviews of the literature conclude that except for very few cases of depression and suicidal ideation there are no convincing evidence-based data to support an association between acitretin and depression/suicidality [53, 54]. a formal review of retinoids (including acitretin and isotretinoin) carried out by the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (prac) of the european medicines agency (ema) in 2018 [55] concluded that it was not possible to identify a clear increase in the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in people taking oral retinoids compared to those that did not. however, the ema decided to include a warning about the possible risk in the product information for oral retinoids, since prac noticed that severe skin disorders themselves increase the risk of psychiatric disorders [56]. based on the above, the guideline group did not consider there to be sufficient evidence to specifically counsel against use of acitretin in those patients with mood disorders but, in common with all systemic therapies, clinicians should monitor for mood changes given that people with psoriasis are at increased risk of anxiety and depression. in two out of three phase iii studies of efficacy and safety of brodalumab in patients with plaque psoriasis (amagine 1–3) cases of suicide were reported (two patients in each of studies 1 and 2) [57, 58]. an expert opinion (2019) discussing these observed cases of suicide highlighted the following aspects [59]: further review of the suicides by the columbia classification algorithm of suicide assessment review board confirmed only three of the cases as suicides. all of them had underlying psychiatric disorders or stressors and all three suicides occurred at one center. both symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased during treatment with brodalumab [58]. in the european smpc, the reported suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide in patients treated with brodalumab was mentioned. however, it was also stated that a causal association between treatment with brodalumab and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. in the smpc, it is recommended that risk and benefit of treatment with brodalumab should be carefully weighed for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation. patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. if a patient suffers from new or worsening symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior is identified, it was recommended to discontinue treatment with brodalumab [60]. results from two phase iii studies including patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (esteem 1 and esteem 2) with open-label extension for up to four years, showed that patient reported depression occurred in 1.4 % of patients treated with apremilast and in 0.5 % of receiving placebo. the incidence of depression did not increase over time. there was one suicide attempt, and no completed suicides with apremilast [61]. similar results were achieved in an open-label extension study (for up to additional four years) of three phase iii studies of patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa); 1.2 % in patients treated with apremilast and 0.8 % in patients receiving placebo. there were two suicide attempts, and no completed suicides with apremilast [62]. post-marketing experience, including five cases of completed suicides, was reported and a new safety information was published for apremilast provided by celgene in agreement with the ema and the uk medicine and healthcare products regulatory authority in 2016 [63]. in here it was stated that evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggested a causal association between suicidal ideation and behavior with the use of apremilast. the smpc and patient leaflet for apremilast was updated to add a warning about depression (common adverse reaction [≥ 1/100 to < 1/10]) and suicidal behavior and ideation (uncommon adverse reaction [≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100]) [64]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) a systematic review was conducted. four prospective studies (oxford level 2) and four retrospective studies (oxford level 3) were included. for details, please refer to the guideline development report and appendix 5 of the evidence report. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) short-term treatment with methotrexate does not appear to have a negative effect on carbohydrate metabolism parameters in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis [65-67]. however, mtx should be administered with caution in the case of diabetes and obesity, due to the increased risk of hepatic fibrosis especially when the cumulative dose exceeds 1.5 g [68, 69]. ciclosporin can increase insulin resistance, interfere with fatty acid metabolism favoring the development of dyslipidemia and the increase of serum uric acid [70]. the diabetogenic effect of csa has been assumed to be related to inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [71], an effect that may be even more relevant in obese psoriatic patients. acitretin effects on insulin resistance are not clearly established. there is no evidence that fumarates and apremilast could affect insulin resistance. additionally, diabetes is not a contraindication for the use of apremilast or fumarates. for patients with renal impairment due to diabetic nephropathy, limitations apply of fumarates as stated in the smpc. clinically significant dyslipidemia has been rarely reported in patients receiving tnfα antagonists, but this is not a common issue in clinical practice [72]. body weight gain could occur in patients treated with tnfα antagonists [73, 74]. in contrast, ustekinumab and il-17 inhibitors usually do not increase body weight in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis [75, 76]. apremilast has been shown to cause weight loss in clinical trials [76]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) finally, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis are candidate for interventions aimed to reduce their cardiovascular risk profile. screening for cardiovascular risks including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia should be recommended for all psoriasis patients [12]. non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight loss, should be recommended to obese patients. indeed, it has been reported that a low-calorie diet inducing a moderate weight loss (i.e. 5 to 10 % of body weight) increases the responsiveness of obese patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to systemic treatments [77-80]. moreover, body weight loss could also increase insulin sensitivity in obese patients with psoriasis. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) finally, it should be considered that diabetic nephropathy occurring in patients with psoriasis could reduce the clearance of any systemic treatments for psoriasis including mtx and csa [81, 82]. ciclosporin should be considered cautiously in patients with diabetes mellitus as significantly increased serum creatinine concentration could be observed [83]. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. we suggest methotrexate as preferred first-line therapy in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease* if other patient characteristics do not preclude its use. in case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest anti-tnfs, ustekinumab, and il-17 inhibitors as preferred targeted therapies in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease*. in case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest that methotrexate, acitretin and apremilast be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *in case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest that ustekinumab, inhibitors of il-17 and of il-23 be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *in case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. a narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. a number of risk factors that predispose one to chronic kidney disease (ckd) are especially prevalent in people with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, being treated with drugs that may impair kidney function. a uk population-based study suggests that the risk of ckd was increased in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, independent of these risk factors [92]. thus, the optimal choice of systemic therapy in the context of ckd is likely to be a relatively common clinical scenario. this is supported by data from the spanish long-term pharmacovigilance registry indicating that 13 % of the total cohort were categorized as having “chronic renal failure” [93]. systemic therapies in summary, acitretin is not known to be nephrotoxic, and ckd (any stage) would not be predicted to markedly impact on drug disposition. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) apremilast has no known nephrotoxic potential. in the pivotal clinical trials there was no evidence for treatment emergent adverse events (aes) related to renal function [64, 94]. in patients with mild to moderate impairment of kidney function, no dose adjustment of apremilast is necessary. when patients have severe impairment of kidney function (egfr below 30 ml/min/1,73 m2 or clcr < 30 ml/min) the dose of apremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) fumarates are known to be potentially nephrotoxic, and may rarely cause an irreversible, proximal renal tubular nephropathy with long-term use. recent studies [95] of dimethyl fumarate (for ms) confirm proteinuria and reduction in egfr to occur more commonly than placebo; german guidelines and the smpc specify careful monitoring of serum creatinine, and treatment cessation in the event of significant change. in healthy individuals, fumarates are extensively metabolized by ubiquitous esterases, and so ckd would not be predicted to significantly impact on drug clearance [96, 97]. ciclosporin has established nephrotoxic potential. acute nephrotoxicity can occur within weeks of treatment initiation, is reversible, and arises due to dose-dependent vascular dysfunction, involving afferent arteriolar constriction that leads to increased vascular resistance and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. tubular dysfunction may also occur, characterized by decreased magnesium re-absorption, decreased uric acid excretion, decreased potassium and hydrogen ion secretion, and distal tubular acidosis. chronic nephrotoxicity [98, 99] is largely irreversible and is characterized by progressive arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular sclerosis. chronic nephrotoxicity is more likely to occur with higher daily doses, larger cumulative doses and long-term therapy (more than 1–2 years). (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) methotrexate is not generally considered nephrotoxic when used at low doses for inflammatory disease, although renal impairment is reported [100], and may be an under-recognized event. methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate are mainly excreted through the kidneys, via glomerular filtration and active transport. methotrexate clearance is therefore reduced (and thus risk of toxicity increased) in the context of ckd, depending on the stage. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) to date, nephrotoxicity has not been reported as an ae in relation to any groups of biologic agents (tnf antagonists, il-17a/il-17ra antagonists, il-12/23p40 antagonists, and il-23p19 antagonists). clearance of biological therapies should not be affected in case of ckd (of any stage). strong consensus, consensus-based we suggest acitretin*, apremilast*, fumarates*, methotrexate* may be used in psoriasis patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (egfr ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) *careful dosing/dose adjustment may be needed; for apremilast if < 30 ml/min/1.73 m². a narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) with the exception of tnf antagonists, any of the standard or biologic treatments can be used in people with co-existing neurological disease. although neurotoxicity is reported with csa, and (rarely) with mtx, there is no evidence that those with pre-existing neurological disease are more at risk. the causal association between tnf antagonists and demyelination remains yet to be proven, although accumulating anecdotal reports, biological plausibility and expert consensus indicate that this class of drugs should be avoided in patients with a clear history of central demyelination. given evidence for a genetic basis to multiple sclerosis (ms) [101], and that asymptomatic first-degree relatives may have morphological evidence of subclinical disease and/or cerebrospinal fluid (csf) oligoclonal bands (reviewed in [102]), it would seem prudent to use tnf antagonists with caution in this group too. dimethyl fumarate is licensed for use in ms, and so may be a preferred first line option, however, surveillance monitoring of peripheral leukocyte counts is strongly recommended in order to minimize the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). ustekinumab and anti-il-17 represent alternative treatment options. a systematic review on the treatment of psoriasis patients with viral hepatitis was conducted, which included 22 studies (oxford level 3). for details, please refer to the guideline development report and appendix 7 of the evidence report. screening choice of treatment depending on the individual health care setting and personal experience and training, we suggest consulting with a hepatologist to choose a systemic treatment for patients that have a positive anti-hbc with a neg. hbsag/hbv-dna test. we suggest, based on the common practice within the guideline group, acitretin, apremilast, fumarates, mtx, ustekinumab and the anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 antibodies as preferred systemic treatment options for this patient group. the available data published is insufficient to give strong recommendations for or against using the available antipsoriatic drugs in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant hepatitis b. an overview table in the long version of the guideline offers a summary of reported cases of reactivation. reported cases need to be seen in correlation to approval date, especially with years and numbers of psoriasis patients with hepatitis exposed to the drug. for detailed information, see the guideline development report. for some of the treatments, hepatitis is mentioned as a contraindication in the smpc, although clinical practice, available case series or registry data may indicate a safety profile in line with treatments where this is not mentioned as a contraindication. this hold particularly true for methotrexate, where study data indicates at least no increase in liver fibrosis [103]. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. this chapter will focus on screening and the next chapter on management in case of unclear tuberculosis (tb) status and/or suspicion of latent tuberculosis. the interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. it is not affected by prior bcg vaccination, but interpreting borderline results can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversion and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. the interferon gamma release assay does not allow for differentiation between active or latent tb [104]. a suppressed immune system (e.g., due to antipsoriatic medication) reduces the sensitivity of tests based on t cell responses. only positive results will be convincing in that case, while negative results cannot rule out a tb infection. negative results of a tuberculin skin test (tst) or igra of hiv-infected patients with a low cd4 count cannot rule out a tb infection. whether to re-screen during, or after a longer interruption and resumption of, biologic therapy depends in large part on the patient’s medical history and clinical examination. the approach is not fundamentally different from that used for initial tuberculosis screening. because there are no definite recommendations regarding the duration of a therapy interruption, a patient’s medical history is also decisive in this regard. in some centers, screening is usually repeated if therapy or care is interrupted for more than twelve months. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, the details of which can be found in the guideline development report. the interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. the interpretation of igra test results (especially borderline results) can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversions and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. in case of borderline results, repeating the test may be advisable [104]. means to distinguish between active and latent tb commonly used in the guidelines group experts’ setting include medical history (exposure risk), signs and symptoms (e.g., current cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats), chest x-ray [105] and urinalysis (pyuria) [106-108]. for details of differential diagnosis of latent versus active tb, please see respective guidelines and reviews [104, 105, 109]. data on reactivation risk with acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters and methotrexate and apremilast is scarce. most published guidelines so far have not recommended tb screening for these drugs (except mtx and csa) [110]. screening before treatment for mtx is recommended in the smpc. the sensitivity of igra and the tuberculin skin test (tst) may be influenced by conventional immunosuppressive treatments, so doing igra initially may be beneficial if a later switch, specially from mtx to other drug categories appears likely [111]. a higher risk of latent tb reactivation has been identified with (in descending order of risk): infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept. cases of latent tb reactivation with ustekinumab have been reported in a long-term study of up to five years [112]. the risk of latent tb reactivation seems to be lowest during treatment with anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 targeted treatments [34, 113]. in a systematic review by snast et al., 78 patients who developed active tb during biologic treatment were analyzed. eighty percent of all cases were treated with adalimumab or infliximab, 12 % were treated with etanercept. no case of active tb was identified with the anti-interleukin-17 agents (ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab). however, the total patient exposure years for these at the time of analysis were much shorter than for the tnf antagonists. all patients in this review had initially been screened for tb. in the majority of cases, patients had no risk factors for primary tb or active tb and presented mostly with extra-pulmonary disease within the first six months of biologic therapy [114]. the long version of the guideline contains a table with an overview of the screening recommendations according to the smpc and a presentation of the data on reports of reactivation under antipsoriatic treatments. the risk assessment may be biased due to the different time periods when the cases occurred. at the time of tnf alpha introduction, tbc screening was not always done, leading to higher numbers of patients with tb being exposed to the respective drugs. in addition to the reported cases of tb reactivation, pathophysiological considerations of the immune response to tb favor the group of anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 as treatment options. interleukin 12 has been reported to play a role in the anti tb immune response. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. psoriasis commonly affects men and women planning conception and women who are pregnant, so understanding the risks of therapy during conception and pregnancy is crucial. psoriasis is not known to have a significant impact on either male or female fertility. although pregnancy has an unpredictable effect on psoriasis, limited evidence suggests that psoriasis usually improves; around 55 % improve during pregnancy, 25 % report no change, and 25 % worsen [115, 116]. conversely in the post-partum period, psoriasis is more likely to flare; around 65 % worsen, 25 % demonstrate no change and 10 % improve. maternal and fetal health outcomes are vital considerations when deciding on the optimal treatment for individuals with psoriasis who are planning conception or are pregnant. although data are limited and not always consistent across studies [117], untreated severe psoriasis in the mother may be detrimental for fetal well-being and pregnancy outcomes, for example it has been shown to be associated with preterm birth and low birthweight babies [118, 119]. the risk of untreated psoriasis of the mother in pregnancy must therefore be weighed against any potential harm through drug exposure of the fetus. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for further information on acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates and methotrexate see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. when providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug smpc. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) all of the biologic agents that are currently licensed for psoriasis except certolizumab pegol contain a human igg1 fc region and are actively transported across the placenta via neonatal fc receptors [120, 121]. active placental transfer is thought to be very low during the first trimester when organogenesis takes place, hence the theoretical risk of teratogenicity of biologics is low. active transfer can, however, occur at around 13 weeks’ gestation and increases significantly after 20 weeks’ gestation. this increasing exposure to biologics during the second and third trimesters is hypothesized to adversely affect fetal development, leading to potential risk of neonatal immunosuppression and greater risk of neonatal infections [122]. biologic therapies typically disappear from an infant’s serum within the first six months of life. in contrast, certolizumab pegol is the only pegylated humanized antigen-binding fragment of a tnf antagonist and it lacks a fc domain [123]. certolizumab pegol therefore does not bind to the human neonatal fc receptor and it is not actively transferred across the placenta. this was underscored by an analysis of 31 pregnancies exposed to infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol (for inflammatory bowel disease), in which the median levels of infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol in the cord blood of infants compared with that of mother were 160 %, 153 %, and 3.9 %, respectively [124]. infliximab and adalimumab could be detected in the infants for as long as six months. post-marketing prospective pharmacokinetic research has confirmed no/minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol via the placenta (crib study, n = 16 [125]) and into breast milk (cradle study, n = 19 [126]). population-based cohort studies that report pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to biologics during conception and/or pregnancy are limited to tnf antagonist exposure only [127-139] (see respective table in the methods & evidence report of the euroguidderm version of the guideline). no evidence was identified on the use of il-12/il-23p40, il-17 or il-23p19 inhibitor biologics. overall, the available studies identified no clear evidence of drug-specific harm to the fetus following tnf antagonist exposure with respect to congenital malformations, live births, pre-term births or neonatal infections [127-139]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) when providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug smpc. all biologic drugs currently licensed for psoriasis (with the exception of certolizumab pegol) are actively transferred to the fetus during the second and third trimester, and the impact of this on neonatal development and risk of infection (to both mother and baby) has not been adequately studied. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for paternal use of acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates, methotrexate and biologics see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. we recommend that men discontinue methotrexate three months before attempting conception*. *ema recommends six months as a means of precaution; the practice of the guideline group differs from this. for chapters 3.13.

e.g., mtx), targeted synthetic disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (tsdmards; e.g., apremilast) and biological disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs (bdmards; e.g., tnf-antagonists). head-to-head trials allowing direct comparison between the different groups or between the individual drugs are extremely rare. indirect comparisons, e.g., network meta-analyses, are limited by the low number of trials for psoriatic arthritis. see table 3 for an overview of randomized controlled trial (rct) data on psoriatic arthritis. the role of nsaids is usually in the relief of symptoms of psoriatic arthritis for patients with mild and non-erosive articular as well as para-articular, entheseal involvement. treatment of nsaids should be limited to the lowest required dosage for the shortest period as needed [8]. methotrexate is recommended, taking the label, the efficacy on skin and peripheral joints, the safety profile and the available long-term experience in the treatment of rheumatic joint disorders into to account [8]. biological dmards for inadequately responding patients after at least one synthetic dmard, we recommend using biological dmards as monotherapy or in combination with synthetic dmards in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis with active joint involvement (psa). previously, guidelines have given a preference to tnf alpha antagonists over other bdmards. in the guideline group’s view, a preference for inhibitors of tnf treatments for psa is no longer mandatory, since ustekinumab (enthesitis) and the il-17a antibody treatments might be equally effective; however more data are needed for its real-life long-term efficacy, safety and co-medication. the treatment with a biological dmard can be performed in monotherapy or in combination with a conventional synthetic dmard. considering the evidence on skin and joint involvement and the experience of the expert group, apremilast is primarily suggested for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant psoriatic arthritis with an inadequate response to at least one csdmard, in whom biological treatments are not appropriate. local injection of glucocorticoids can be recommended in patients with active mono- or oligoarthritis, dactylitis with enthesitis or tendosynovitis. systemic usage of glucocorticoids should not be standard for treatment of psoriatic arthritis, but if needed, e.g., during flares, “systemic steroids at the lowest effective dose may be used with caution” [9]. tapering of glucocorticoids should be done slowly and stepwise when feasible. a narrative review of the existing literature and an assessment of the approval status of psoriasis therapies for crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis were conducted. existing guidelines were consulted [10-12]. likely due to an overlap in the pathophysiology and genetic background of psoriasis and crohn’s disease, the risk of psoriasis patients developing crohn’s disease is approximately two- to threefold higher compared to the general population [13, 14]. the il-17a antibody secukinumab and the il-17ra antibody brodalumab have failed in studies in crohn’s disease, with some patients experiencing worsening of their disease during treatment [15, 16]. cases of newly onset crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have been observed during treatment of psoriasis patients with il-17 inhibitors. the observed signal is, however, low, and it is presently unclear if the rate exceeds the rate expected in a psoriasis population [17]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version.) in contrast, ustekinumab, adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab are all targeted therapies approved not only for the treatment of psoriasis, but also for the treatment of crohn’s disease and, in the case of adalimumab, infliximab and ustekinumab, ulcerative colitis; dosages may vary between psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). notably, the anti-tnf fusion protein etanercept failed in clinical trials in crohn’s disease [18]. there is an ongoing phase ii/iii clinical development program for the il-23p19 inhibitors guselkumab and risankizumab in crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. in the case of risankizumab, positive clinical effects have been published for the induction and long term treatment of patients with crohn’s disease [19, 20] and are supported by immunological findings in the intestinal mucosa of patients with crohn’s disease receiving the drug [21]. there are several published case reports on the successful use of guselkumab in patients with crohn’s disease [22, 23]. due to their intestinal side effect profile with a relatively frequent induction of abdominal pain, loose stools and diarrhea, fumarates should not be used in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). severe gastrointestinal diseases are listed as contraindication in the prescription information of fumaderm® and skilarence®. inhibition of pde4 with apremilast has shown positive effects in a phase ii trial with ulcerative colitis [24]. methotrexate has limited efficacy in crohn’s disease [25, 26] and probably even less in ulcerative colitis [27, 28], but there is a considerable body of experience and no signal for a worsening of these conditions. acitretin may be considered neutral in patients with psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease and has been used in the treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease that developed psoriasiform lesions (including cases of so called paradoxical psoriasis) during treatment with tnf antagonist [29]. ciclosporin (csa) is frequently used in the treatment of steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis and has demonstrated long term outcomes similar to those of infliximab [30]. in patients with psoriasis and active ibd or a history of ibd, we recommend preferentially using approved targeted therapies with a documented efficacy in these conditions: crohn’s disease: anti-tnf (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) and anti-il-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). ulcerative colitis: anti-tnf (infliximab, adalimumab) and anti-il-12/23p40 (ustekinumab). if these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice targeted treatment options in patients with psoriasis and ibd: crohn’s disease: anti-il-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) ulcerative colitis: anti-il-23p19 (preferred risankizumab, guselkumab; also possible: tildrakizumab) if these first-choice treatments cannot be used, we suggest the following treatments to be considered as second choice oral treatment options in patients with psoriasis and ibd: crohn’s disease: methotrexate. active ulcerative colitis: ciclosporin (preferred), apremilast (also possible). this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) some studies have studied the possible association of the use of systemic therapies for psoriasis and incident cancer (in patients without previous history of cancer). a systematic review of rcts and observational studies exploring the risk of cancer in psoriasis patients treated with biologics described an increased risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in those patients being treated with anti-tnfs. however, included studies lacked adjustment for highly relevant confounding factors such as prior phototherapy. data on other cancers do not show a risk associated with exposure to drugs. however, the studies are likely to be underpowered to ascertain the risk of individual types of cancer [31]. vaengebjerg et al. did not find increased risk of cancer in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis on biologics compared with other systemic therapies [32]. there are also some studies describing the risk of cancer associated with systemic therapy for other immune-mediated disorders, mainly rheumatoid arthritis, other rheumatic disorders and inflammatory bowel disease. results in these disorders might not be appropriately extrapolated to psoriasis patients, as psoriatic patients receive less immunosuppressive therapy (specially corticosteroids) and the associated disorders are different [33]. most studies are reassuring and did not find a relationship between exposure to anti-tnfs and risk of incident cancer in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis [34]. luo et al., analyzing data from nine cohorts, described an increased risk of cancer in psoriatic arthritis patients treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, which was not seen in patients receiving biologics. however, this increase was due to nonmelanoma skin cancer (nmsc) and included studies have not considered the likely effect of previous puva therapy [35]. summary of product characteristics (smpcs) of tnf inhibitors contain information regarding the risk of lymphoma/leukemia. however, these are rare events and data supporting this association are conflicting. so far, no such association have been shown for psoriasis patients [31]. few studies provide information that is relevant for answering this question. regarding patients with precancerous conditions (data available only for cervical dysplasia), a study using routine data of women with rheumatoid arthritis (ra), describe that initiation of therapy with a biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (bdmard) was associated with an increased, but not statistically significant, risk of high-grade cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer compared to initiation of a nonbiological (nb)dmard [36]. conversely, a review analyzing 238 women with ra and a history of cervical carcinoma in situ, no genital cancer was observed in the tnf inhibitor (tnfi)-treated group over a median of 5.2 years of follow-up compared with two incidents of genital cancer in the nbdmard-treated group, during a median follow-up of 3.9 years [37]. a systematic review of studies of patients with a history of cancer and exposed to anti-tnf therapy assessing for the risk of the occurrence of new cancer or cancer re-occurrence compared to nbdmards, included nine studies with 11,679 patients. none of them were studies on psoriasis. the outcome measures were heterogeneous, with many studies focused on describing nmsc. overall, the study did not find an increased risk of recurrence in patients treated with anti-tnfs compared to nbdmards [38]. a retrospective study, based on routine data, of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, and a previous nmsc, described an increased risk of a second nmsc in patients treated with methotrexate that was higher with longer exposures. anti-tnf use was also associated with an increased risk, mostly in a subgroup (patients with ra and concomitant use of methotrexate) [39]. another systematic review analyzed the risk of cancer recurrence in patients with immune-mediated diseases exposed to immune-suppressive therapies. they included 16 observational studies with 11,702 participants after a cancer diagnosis and with 1,698 new or recurrent cases of cancer. only one very small study, and not contributing to the final analysis, was focused on psoriasis patients. overall, rates of cancer recurrence were similar among participants receiving anti-tnf therapy, immune-modulator therapy or no immunosuppression, but was higher among patients receiving combination immune suppression [40]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for patients with recent malignancy we recommend topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band uvb)* and/or acitretin. *except patients with a recent and/or high risk of cutaneous malignancy. in case of inadequate response to topical therapies, phototherapy (narrow band uvb), and/or acitretin we suggest using mtx in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer. **for patients with history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, see background text. we suggest anti-tnf or ustekinumab can be used based on existing safety data on a case-by-case basis including discussion with cancer specialist. we suggest anti-il17 or anti il23 can be used in psoriasis patients with a previous history of cancer despite the lack of long-term experience based on pathophysiological considerations on a case-by-case basis including discussion with a cancer specialist. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. psoriasis is associated with a higher risk for psychiatric comorbidities including anxiety and depression while results on suicide ideation and suicide are more unclear [12, 41–44]. in general, interventions that are effective for psoriasis correspondingly also improve symptoms of depression. clinical studies using adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, ixekizumab, guselkumab or fumarates for the treatment of psoriasis have shown that all these anti-inflammatory drugs not only improve psoriatic manifestations, but also symptoms of depression [43, 45–50]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) acitretin has been reported to be associated with depression in some case reports [51, 52]. however, more recent reviews of the literature conclude that except for very few cases of depression and suicidal ideation there are no convincing evidence-based data to support an association between acitretin and depression/suicidality [53, 54]. a formal review of retinoids (including acitretin and isotretinoin) carried out by the pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee (prac) of the european medicines agency (ema) in 2018 [55] concluded that it was not possible to identify a clear increase in the risk of neuropsychiatric disorders in people taking oral retinoids compared to those that did not. however, the ema decided to include a warning about the possible risk in the product information for oral retinoids, since prac noticed that severe skin disorders themselves increase the risk of psychiatric disorders [56]. based on the above, the guideline group did not consider there to be sufficient evidence to specifically counsel against use of acitretin in those patients with mood disorders but, in common with all systemic therapies, clinicians should monitor for mood changes given that people with psoriasis are at increased risk of anxiety and depression. in two out of three phase iii studies of efficacy and safety of brodalumab in patients with plaque psoriasis (amagine 1–3) cases of suicide were reported (two patients in each of studies 1 and 2) [57, 58]. an expert opinion (2019) discussing these observed cases of suicide highlighted the following aspects [59]: further review of the suicides by the columbia classification algorithm of suicide assessment review board confirmed only three of the cases as suicides. all of them had underlying psychiatric disorders or stressors and all three suicides occurred at one center. both symptoms of depression and anxiety decreased during treatment with brodalumab [58]. in the european smpc, the reported suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicide in patients treated with brodalumab was mentioned. however, it was also stated that a causal association between treatment with brodalumab and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established. in the smpc, it is recommended that risk and benefit of treatment with brodalumab should be carefully weighed for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation. patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they should contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. if a patient suffers from new or worsening symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior is identified, it was recommended to discontinue treatment with brodalumab [60]. results from two phase iii studies including patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis (esteem 1 and esteem 2) with open-label extension for up to four years, showed that patient reported depression occurred in 1.4 % of patients treated with apremilast and in 0.5 % of receiving placebo. the incidence of depression did not increase over time. there was one suicide attempt, and no completed suicides with apremilast [61]. similar results were achieved in an open-label extension study (for up to additional four years) of three phase iii studies of patients with psoriatic arthritis (psa); 1.2 % in patients treated with apremilast and 0.8 % in patients receiving placebo. there were two suicide attempts, and no completed suicides with apremilast [62]. post-marketing experience, including five cases of completed suicides, was reported and a new safety information was published for apremilast provided by celgene in agreement with the ema and the uk medicine and healthcare products regulatory authority in 2016 [63]. in here it was stated that evidence from clinical trials and post-marketing experience suggested a causal association between suicidal ideation and behavior with the use of apremilast. the smpc and patient leaflet for apremilast was updated to add a warning about depression (common adverse reaction [≥ 1/100 to < 1/10]) and suicidal behavior and ideation (uncommon adverse reaction [≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100]) [64]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) a systematic review was conducted. four prospective studies (oxford level 2) and four retrospective studies (oxford level 3) were included. for details, please refer to the guideline development report and appendix 5 of the evidence report. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) short-term treatment with methotrexate does not appear to have a negative effect on carbohydrate metabolism parameters in patients with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis [65-67]. however, mtx should be administered with caution in the case of diabetes and obesity, due to the increased risk of hepatic fibrosis especially when the cumulative dose exceeds 1.5 g [68, 69]. ciclosporin can increase insulin resistance, interfere with fatty acid metabolism favoring the development of dyslipidemia and the increase of serum uric acid [70]. the diabetogenic effect of csa has been assumed to be related to inhibition of insulin secretion from pancreas islet cells [71], an effect that may be even more relevant in obese psoriatic patients. acitretin effects on insulin resistance are not clearly established. there is no evidence that fumarates and apremilast could affect insulin resistance. additionally, diabetes is not a contraindication for the use of apremilast or fumarates. for patients with renal impairment due to diabetic nephropathy, limitations apply of fumarates as stated in the smpc. clinically significant dyslipidemia has been rarely reported in patients receiving tnfα antagonists, but this is not a common issue in clinical practice [72]. body weight gain could occur in patients treated with tnfα antagonists [73, 74]. in contrast, ustekinumab and il-17 inhibitors usually do not increase body weight in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis [75, 76]. apremilast has been shown to cause weight loss in clinical trials [76]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) finally, patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis are candidate for interventions aimed to reduce their cardiovascular risk profile. screening for cardiovascular risks including diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia should be recommended for all psoriasis patients [12]. non-pharmacological interventions, such as weight loss, should be recommended to obese patients. indeed, it has been reported that a low-calorie diet inducing a moderate weight loss (i.e. 5 to 10 % of body weight) increases the responsiveness of obese patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis to systemic treatments [77-80]. moreover, body weight loss could also increase insulin sensitivity in obese patients with psoriasis. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) finally, it should be considered that diabetic nephropathy occurring in patients with psoriasis could reduce the clearance of any systemic treatments for psoriasis including mtx and csa [81, 82]. ciclosporin should be considered cautiously in patients with diabetes mellitus as significantly increased serum creatinine concentration could be observed [83]. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. we suggest methotrexate as preferred first-line therapy in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease* if other patient characteristics do not preclude its use. in case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest anti-tnfs, ustekinumab, and il-17 inhibitors as preferred targeted therapies in patients with psoriasis and ischemic heart disease*. in case of concomitant congestive heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest that methotrexate, acitretin and apremilast be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *in case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. we suggest that ustekinumab, inhibitors of il-17 and of il-23 be considered as treatment in patients with psoriasis and advanced congestive heart failure*. *in case of concomitant ischemic heart failure, also note the recommendations from the respective section. a narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. a number of risk factors that predispose one to chronic kidney disease (ckd) are especially prevalent in people with multiple comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, being treated with drugs that may impair kidney function. a uk population-based study suggests that the risk of ckd was increased in people with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, independent of these risk factors [92]. thus, the optimal choice of systemic therapy in the context of ckd is likely to be a relatively common clinical scenario. this is supported by data from the spanish long-term pharmacovigilance registry indicating that 13 % of the total cohort were categorized as having “chronic renal failure” [93]. systemic therapies in summary, acitretin is not known to be nephrotoxic, and ckd (any stage) would not be predicted to markedly impact on drug disposition. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) apremilast has no known nephrotoxic potential. in the pivotal clinical trials there was no evidence for treatment emergent adverse events (aes) related to renal function [64, 94]. in patients with mild to moderate impairment of kidney function, no dose adjustment of apremilast is necessary. when patients have severe impairment of kidney function (egfr below 30 ml/min/1,73 m2 or clcr < 30 ml/min) the dose of apremilast should be reduced to 30 mg once daily. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) fumarates are known to be potentially nephrotoxic, and may rarely cause an irreversible, proximal renal tubular nephropathy with long-term use. recent studies [95] of dimethyl fumarate (for ms) confirm proteinuria and reduction in egfr to occur more commonly than placebo; german guidelines and the smpc specify careful monitoring of serum creatinine, and treatment cessation in the event of significant change. in healthy individuals, fumarates are extensively metabolized by ubiquitous esterases, and so ckd would not be predicted to significantly impact on drug clearance [96, 97]. ciclosporin has established nephrotoxic potential. acute nephrotoxicity can occur within weeks of treatment initiation, is reversible, and arises due to dose-dependent vascular dysfunction, involving afferent arteriolar constriction that leads to increased vascular resistance and a decrease in glomerular filtration rate. tubular dysfunction may also occur, characterized by decreased magnesium re-absorption, decreased uric acid excretion, decreased potassium and hydrogen ion secretion, and distal tubular acidosis. chronic nephrotoxicity [98, 99] is largely irreversible and is characterized by progressive arteriolar hyalinosis, interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, and glomerular sclerosis. chronic nephrotoxicity is more likely to occur with higher daily doses, larger cumulative doses and long-term therapy (more than 1–2 years). (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) methotrexate is not generally considered nephrotoxic when used at low doses for inflammatory disease, although renal impairment is reported [100], and may be an under-recognized event. methotrexate and 7-hydroxymethotrexate are mainly excreted through the kidneys, via glomerular filtration and active transport. methotrexate clearance is therefore reduced (and thus risk of toxicity increased) in the context of ckd, depending on the stage. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) to date, nephrotoxicity has not been reported as an ae in relation to any groups of biologic agents (tnf antagonists, il-17a/il-17ra antagonists, il-12/23p40 antagonists, and il-23p19 antagonists). clearance of biological therapies should not be affected in case of ckd (of any stage). strong consensus, consensus-based we suggest acitretin*, apremilast*, fumarates*, methotrexate* may be used in psoriasis patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (egfr ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) *careful dosing/dose adjustment may be needed; for apremilast if < 30 ml/min/1.73 m². a narrative review of the existing literature was conducted. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) with the exception of tnf antagonists, any of the standard or biologic treatments can be used in people with co-existing neurological disease. although neurotoxicity is reported with csa, and (rarely) with mtx, there is no evidence that those with pre-existing neurological disease are more at risk. the causal association between tnf antagonists and demyelination remains yet to be proven, although accumulating anecdotal reports, biological plausibility and expert consensus indicate that this class of drugs should be avoided in patients with a clear history of central demyelination. given evidence for a genetic basis to multiple sclerosis (ms) [101], and that asymptomatic first-degree relatives may have morphological evidence of subclinical disease and/or cerebrospinal fluid (csf) oligoclonal bands (reviewed in [102]), it would seem prudent to use tnf antagonists with caution in this group too. dimethyl fumarate is licensed for use in ms, and so may be a preferred first line option, however, surveillance monitoring of peripheral leukocyte counts is strongly recommended in order to minimize the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml). ustekinumab and anti-il-17 represent alternative treatment options. a systematic review on the treatment of psoriasis patients with viral hepatitis was conducted, which included 22 studies (oxford level 3). for details, please refer to the guideline development report and appendix 7 of the evidence report. screening choice of treatment depending on the individual health care setting and personal experience and training, we suggest consulting with a hepatologist to choose a systemic treatment for patients that have a positive anti-hbc with a neg. hbsag/hbv-dna test. we suggest, based on the common practice within the guideline group, acitretin, apremilast, fumarates, mtx, ustekinumab and the anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 antibodies as preferred systemic treatment options for this patient group. the available data published is insufficient to give strong recommendations for or against using the available antipsoriatic drugs in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and concomitant hepatitis b. an overview table in the long version of the guideline offers a summary of reported cases of reactivation. reported cases need to be seen in correlation to approval date, especially with years and numbers of psoriasis patients with hepatitis exposed to the drug. for detailed information, see the guideline development report. for some of the treatments, hepatitis is mentioned as a contraindication in the smpc, although clinical practice, available case series or registry data may indicate a safety profile in line with treatments where this is not mentioned as a contraindication. this hold particularly true for methotrexate, where study data indicates at least no increase in liver fibrosis [103]. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. this chapter will focus on screening and the next chapter on management in case of unclear tuberculosis (tb) status and/or suspicion of latent tuberculosis. the interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. it is not affected by prior bcg vaccination, but interpreting borderline results can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversion and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. the interferon gamma release assay does not allow for differentiation between active or latent tb [104]. a suppressed immune system (e.g., due to antipsoriatic medication) reduces the sensitivity of tests based on t cell responses. only positive results will be convincing in that case, while negative results cannot rule out a tb infection. negative results of a tuberculin skin test (tst) or igra of hiv-infected patients with a low cd4 count cannot rule out a tb infection. whether to re-screen during, or after a longer interruption and resumption of, biologic therapy depends in large part on the patient’s medical history and clinical examination. the approach is not fundamentally different from that used for initial tuberculosis screening. because there are no definite recommendations regarding the duration of a therapy interruption, a patient’s medical history is also decisive in this regard. in some centers, screening is usually repeated if therapy or care is interrupted for more than twelve months. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of the guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, the details of which can be found in the guideline development report. the interferon gamma release assay is a specific blood test. the interpretation of igra test results (especially borderline results) can be limited due to issues in the cut-off values, shifting conversions and reversion rates over time, and varying test reproducibility. in case of borderline results, repeating the test may be advisable [104]. means to distinguish between active and latent tb commonly used in the guidelines group experts’ setting include medical history (exposure risk), signs and symptoms (e.g., current cough, fever, weight loss, night sweats), chest x-ray [105] and urinalysis (pyuria) [106-108]. for details of differential diagnosis of latent versus active tb, please see respective guidelines and reviews [104, 105, 109]. data on reactivation risk with acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters and methotrexate and apremilast is scarce. most published guidelines so far have not recommended tb screening for these drugs (except mtx and csa) [110]. screening before treatment for mtx is recommended in the smpc. the sensitivity of igra and the tuberculin skin test (tst) may be influenced by conventional immunosuppressive treatments, so doing igra initially may be beneficial if a later switch, specially from mtx to other drug categories appears likely [111]. a higher risk of latent tb reactivation has been identified with (in descending order of risk): infliximab, adalimumab and etanercept. cases of latent tb reactivation with ustekinumab have been reported in a long-term study of up to five years [112]. the risk of latent tb reactivation seems to be lowest during treatment with anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 targeted treatments [34, 113]. in a systematic review by snast et al., 78 patients who developed active tb during biologic treatment were analyzed. eighty percent of all cases were treated with adalimumab or infliximab, 12 % were treated with etanercept. no case of active tb was identified with the anti-interleukin-17 agents (ixekizumab, secukinumab, and brodalumab). however, the total patient exposure years for these at the time of analysis were much shorter than for the tnf antagonists. all patients in this review had initially been screened for tb. in the majority of cases, patients had no risk factors for primary tb or active tb and presented mostly with extra-pulmonary disease within the first six months of biologic therapy [114]. the long version of the guideline contains a table with an overview of the screening recommendations according to the smpc and a presentation of the data on reports of reactivation under antipsoriatic treatments. the risk assessment may be biased due to the different time periods when the cases occurred. at the time of tnf alpha introduction, tbc screening was not always done, leading to higher numbers of patients with tb being exposed to the respective drugs. in addition to the reported cases of tb reactivation, pathophysiological considerations of the immune response to tb favor the group of anti-il-17 and anti-il-23 as treatment options. interleukin 12 has been reported to play a role in the anti tb immune response. this chapter is based on the related chapter in previous versions of this guideline [1, 2]. a systematic search was conducted, details of which can be found in the guideline development report. psoriasis commonly affects men and women planning conception and women who are pregnant, so understanding the risks of therapy during conception and pregnancy is crucial. psoriasis is not known to have a significant impact on either male or female fertility. although pregnancy has an unpredictable effect on psoriasis, limited evidence suggests that psoriasis usually improves; around 55 % improve during pregnancy, 25 % report no change, and 25 % worsen [115, 116]. conversely in the post-partum period, psoriasis is more likely to flare; around 65 % worsen, 25 % demonstrate no change and 10 % improve. maternal and fetal health outcomes are vital considerations when deciding on the optimal treatment for individuals with psoriasis who are planning conception or are pregnant. although data are limited and not always consistent across studies [117], untreated severe psoriasis in the mother may be detrimental for fetal well-being and pregnancy outcomes, for example it has been shown to be associated with preterm birth and low birthweight babies [118, 119]. the risk of untreated psoriasis of the mother in pregnancy must therefore be weighed against any potential harm through drug exposure of the fetus. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for further information on acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates and methotrexate see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. when providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug smpc. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) all of the biologic agents that are currently licensed for psoriasis except certolizumab pegol contain a human igg1 fc region and are actively transported across the placenta via neonatal fc receptors [120, 121]. active placental transfer is thought to be very low during the first trimester when organogenesis takes place, hence the theoretical risk of teratogenicity of biologics is low. active transfer can, however, occur at around 13 weeks’ gestation and increases significantly after 20 weeks’ gestation. this increasing exposure to biologics during the second and third trimesters is hypothesized to adversely affect fetal development, leading to potential risk of neonatal immunosuppression and greater risk of neonatal infections [122]. biologic therapies typically disappear from an infant’s serum within the first six months of life. in contrast, certolizumab pegol is the only pegylated humanized antigen-binding fragment of a tnf antagonist and it lacks a fc domain [123]. certolizumab pegol therefore does not bind to the human neonatal fc receptor and it is not actively transferred across the placenta. this was underscored by an analysis of 31 pregnancies exposed to infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol (for inflammatory bowel disease), in which the median levels of infliximab, adalimumab and certolizumab pegol in the cord blood of infants compared with that of mother were 160 %, 153 %, and 3.9 %, respectively [124]. infliximab and adalimumab could be detected in the infants for as long as six months. post-marketing prospective pharmacokinetic research has confirmed no/minimal transfer of certolizumab pegol via the placenta (crib study, n = 16 [125]) and into breast milk (cradle study, n = 19 [126]). population-based cohort studies that report pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to biologics during conception and/or pregnancy are limited to tnf antagonist exposure only [127-139] (see respective table in the methods & evidence report of the euroguidderm version of the guideline). no evidence was identified on the use of il-12/il-23p40, il-17 or il-23p19 inhibitor biologics. overall, the available studies identified no clear evidence of drug-specific harm to the fetus following tnf antagonist exposure with respect to congenital malformations, live births, pre-term births or neonatal infections [127-139]. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) when providing advice on use of systemic therapies in women planning conception or who are pregnant, prescribers are advised to use these recommendations with reference to the individual drug smpc. all biologic drugs currently licensed for psoriasis (with the exception of certolizumab pegol) are actively transferred to the fetus during the second and third trimester, and the impact of this on neonatal development and risk of infection (to both mother and baby) has not been adequately studied. (for further information see additional background text in the long version of the guideline.) for paternal use of acitretin, apremilast, ciclosporin, fumarates, methotrexate and biologics see additional background text in the long version of the guideline. we recommend that men discontinue methotrexate three months before attempting conception*. *ema recommends six months as a means of precaution; the practice of the guideline group differs from this. for chapters 3.13. (vaccinations) and 3.14. (immunogenicity) see long version of the guideline. for chapter 3.15. (covid-19), a narrative review of the existing literature was conducted in late april 2020. the most up to date version of this chapter can be found alongside the main guideline document on the edf website. the development of the euroguiderm guideline was funded by the european forum of dermatology. the german adaptation was funded by the german dermatological society. for authors of the german guideline: see guideline development report. for authors of the euroguiderm guideline: see euroguiderm guideline on the systemic treatment of psoriasis vulgaris – methods & evidence report. available at: https://www.edf.one/home/guidelines/euroguiderm-psoriasis-vulgaris.html open access funding enabled and organized by projekt deal."

Reviews",NA,"0105-2896","10.1111/imr.12970","https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12970","since the end of 2019, when the world was struck by the covid-19 pandemic,1, 2 discussions regarding immunology seem not to be restricted to lecture halls and laboratories anymore, but have moved beyond the scientific community into public society. popular talk shows and social media platforms nowadays not sporadically contain (non-scientific) conversations about herd immunity, neutralizing antibodies, the r-number, t cell cross-reactivity, rapid tests, host-directed therapy (chloroquine), and, of course, vaccines. with respect to the latter, the post-covid-19 laymen attention focuses, besides on availability, on vaccine composition, regimen, trials, boosters, and efficacy, topics that, not too long ago, were considered far from appealing topics of conversation by non-scientist. to pull us out of the economically and socially devastating restrictions imposed on society by this global pandemic, the hope of the public is now directed on the new anti-covid-19 vaccines that are currently being rolled out in many countries across the world. taken this present-day extent of public attention for immunology into consideration, it should have become common knowledge by now that long-term investments in research of immunology (inseparably linked with vaccinology) of infectious diseases, including those caused by pathogenic mycobacteria, have provided vital contributions to the current capability to develop and produce covid-19 vaccines in <1 year. still, development of better diagnostics and improved vaccines has been relatively slow despite their protracted impact on the health of humans and animals as well as global economies. this controversy is reflecting the unpropitious funding situation of this research domain, which is quite disproportional with the number of casualties particularly in the case of tuberculosis (tb), a respiratory disease that, before 2020, has been more lethal than any other disease from a single infectious agent.3 however, in contrast to covid-19, which has severely hit europe and the usa as well, mycobacterial diseases mostly affect individuals in low- and middle-income countries (lmics). this volume of immunological reviews comprises papers that encompass (recent) findings on the immunology of mycobacterial diseases caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb), m leprae, m ulcerans, m avium, m absessus, m bovis, and m avium subspecies paratuberculosis, as well as immunity induced by the vaccine strain m bovis bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg), thereby illustrating the progress made in basic research on immunity to mycobacteria. this includes the role that classical and more recently discovered (t) cells play in these intriguing host-pathogen interactions as well as potential application thereof within vaccination strategies and as correlates of protection and disease in diagnostics. to unravel mechanisms of disease various “omics” technologies have contributed, leading to new insights regarding (prospective) diagnostics for4-8 as well as immune mechanisms of mycobacterial diseases.9, 10 in addition, it addresses the plethora of sophisticated survival strategies including manipulation of phagosome maturation, autophagy, mitochondrial activity, antigen presentation, and metabolic pathways that these mycobacteria can employ to evade the hosts’ immune systems. despite the discovery of effective antibiotic treatments and neonatal bcg vaccination in endemic areas, tuberculosis (tb) has historically caused more deaths than any other single human infectious disease worldwide, even surpassing hiv/aids and malaria as the leading cause of death.11 globally, an estimated 10.0 million people fell ill with tb in 2019 and 1.4 million deaths (including 208 000 among hiv-positive people) were attributed to this disease representing more than 3800 deaths per day.11 it is estimated that about 1,7 billion people (23% of the world's population) are latently infected with mtb and thus at risk of developing active tb disease sometime during their lifetime.12 moreover, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (mdr-tb) represents a major obstacle to effective care and prevention worldwide. furthermore, the large gap (2.9 million) between the number of newly diagnosed patients reported and the estimated 10 million active tb cases, which is due to a combination of under-reporting of detected cases and under-diagnosis (if people with tb cannot access health care or are not diagnosed when they do),13 calls for better diagnostic tests. of note is also the one health aspect of this disease, as in lmics, a significant number of human tb cases are actually caused by m bovis infection.14-16 since vaccines, in general, represent an extremely efficient way to reduce disease burden by preventing disease or even infection,17 multiple research projects have focused on new vaccines and vaccination strategies to prevent tb as alternative to or combined with bcg.18-21 in order to develop new vaccines, detailed insight into the complex events of host immunity against mycobacteria has been deemed necessary for decades.22, 23 at the basis of such efforts lies the search for what substantiates the optimal protective, non-pathogenic t cell response.24-26 this involves a growing number of t cells that contribute to either enhancing or suppressing protective immunity and recognize antigens involved in various stages of infection and disease.21, 27, 28 a dominant role is reserved for cd4 t cells as clear from depletion of this subset or transduction of hla class ii in animal models and supported by the fact that patients with hiv infection who have reduced cd4 t cell counts are more susceptible to primary mtb infection, reinfection and reactivation.27, 29-31 in this issue, morgan and colleagues (imr-2021-001.r1) provide a holistic view on the role of classical, hla class ii-restricted cd4 t cells in mtb infection. from this perspective, they compare the presence of various classical cd4 t cell subsets (classified using proteomics in functional signatures according to extensive cell surface expression as well as cytokine production), that have been identified to have importance for mtb-specific immunity in either latent infection, active tb, severe tb, after bcg-vaccination, or environmental exposure (eg, by non-tuberculous mycobacteria). this involves a detailed subdivision into memory phenotypes and helper t cell phenotypes like th1, th2, th17, and the heterogeneous th1*, a distinct hybrid th1/th17 population.32 besides cd4 t cells, they discuss their antigenic targets which identified, for example, using epitope megapools33 (4,000 orfs of the mtb genome) as universal tool to measure hla class ii-restricted cd4 t cells across different disease states. jointly, cd4 activation markers, the epitopes they recognize, and proteins they secrete as well as transcriptomic and metabolomic markers are promising correlates of protection, although they may vary in different populations. on the other hand, ruibal and colleagues (imr-2020-074.r1), inspired by the limited success of vaccines against tb based on classical t and b cells, embark on the non-classical path and convincingly argue on the value of donor-unrestricted t-cells (durts) as targets for novel vaccines against tb. the attractiveness of these durts lies in the fact that they recognize antigenic ligands via genetically conserved antigen presentation molecules such that their application avoids. the attractiveness of such an approach is that durts, in contrast to classical t cells which are activated via highly polymorphic hla class i and ii molecules, can respond to the same ligands across diverse human populations. this not only provides advantages for vaccination but also for correlates of protection. in their contribution, they describe several populations of t cells categorized under durts such as hla-e-restricted t cells,34, 35 cd1-restricted t cells, mucosal-associated invariant t-cells (maits), and tcr γδ t cells. besides durts, they discuss nk cells and innate lymphoid cells (ilcs) and the gain of targeting these cells with vaccines against mtb. it needs to be assessed in future studies how, combined with classical immune responses, these unconventional subsets have potential to contribute essential, additional protective immunity against tb, leprosy, and ntm infections. the role of yet another t cell subset is scrutinized in the review by verma and colleagues (imr-2020-082.r2) who discuss regulatory t cells (tregs)36 in the context of homeostasis. but also the potential role of tregs in tipping the (th-treg) balance based on studies in humans and animal models of mtb that suggest tregs cannot only help reduce tissue-damaging inflammation, but also have immunosuppressive functions that interfere with protective responses against this mycobacterium. additionally, they describe immune mechanisms in the often difficult to treat infections with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (ntm) such as m avium and m absessus the prevalence of which is increasing at an alarming rate.37 from a completely different angle, kilinç and colleagues (imr-2020-087) believe in prospective use of host-directed therapy (hdt) to tackle the problems encountered in mycobacterial infections, namely the multiple counter-strategies that mycobacteria have ingeniously developed to persist and survive inside host cells. this has been investigated substantially already for the cunning tactics that mtb utilizes,38, 39 but receives warranted attention for ntm as well in this review for which they included all relevant studies of the past 20 years. in their review, they include not only mtb infection but also discuss what is known or assumed about ntm, particularly m avium infections. on yet another angle of approach, laval and colleagues (imr-2020-071.r1) have chosen to investigate the effect of macrophage fatty acid metabolism on host immunity to mtb. by integrating findings from immunological and microbiological studies, they introduce the new concept that lipid droplet formation in mtb-infected macrophages, besides allowing the bacterium to produce energy and build the lipid-rich cell wall, may also benefit the host. this pro-host mechanism by preventing mtb's access to host fatty acids while limiting the flux of fatty acids through β-oxidation. key in the metabolic adaptation of macrophages to mtb infection leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of fas which potentiates their anti-mycobacterial responses and forces the intracellular pathogen to shift into fat-saving, survival mode. despite years of intensive research, bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) remains the only licensed vaccine against tb. the 100-year-old vaccine protects against childhood tb, but is not unanimously effective in adult pulmonary tb. several vaccine trials using bcg have, however, established its protective effect against leprosy40 and ntm.41 it has also become clear that bcg can modulate the innate immune system leading to protection against unrelated pathogens through a mechanism referred to as trained immunity.42 these heterologous benefits of bcg may even prove relevant in vaccination strategies to prevent covid-19. to optimally utilize and improve upon the bcg vaccine in new vaccine strategies such as bcg re-vaccination17 or new administration routes,43 ahmed and colleagues (imr-2021-007) unravel what is known about protective immune responses elicited by bcg against tb and other mycobacterial ailments including factors that may be responsible for the variable efficacy of bcg such as host and environment. in view of the current covid-19 pandemic, these authors also involve the debate on potential protective responses against sars-cov-2 induced by bcg vaccination.44, 45 as opposed of addressing protection against tb disease, foster and colleagues (imr-2020-084.r1) focus on bcg-induced protection against mtb infection. they review evidence from observational and bcg re-vaccination studies, including limitations and variation in protection as well as possible underlying mechanisms such as antibody-mediated protection and innate immune mechanisms, particularly histone modifications at the promoter and enhancer regions of pro-inflammatory genes the hallmark of bcg-induced trained immunity. paratuberculosis, like bovine tb, is a mycobacterial disease of ruminants caused by mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map) which has a considerable impact on livestock health, welfare, and production.46 map causes a granulomatous chronic intestinal infection also known as johne's disease, impacting cattle, sheep, goat, and deer industries globally. although there are at least three vaccines, vaccinated animals can still shed map thereby maintaining transmission47 and disease detection still relies heavily on dated methods. de silva (imr-2020-086.r2) describes potential suitable biomarkers and the immunological mechanisms they represent, focusing on the resilience phenotype. since map is an enteric pathogen, she argues that vaccination inducing mucosal immunity should be prioritized. in this process, the ease of application and access to mucosal surfaces will determine the most practical and efficient vaccine. after tb, leprosy, caused by m leprae, ranks second in the order of severe human mycobacterial diseases. in contrast to mtb, it is not very contagious, requiring frequent and intense contact c. it predominantly affects the skin and peripheral nerves reflecting the optimal growth temperature of this mycobacterium. although leprosy is known to humans for many centuries, its immunopathology still represents a complex scientific challenge to clinicians as well as immunologists.48 characteristic for leprosy is its unique disease spectrum, in susceptible individuals, reflecting the vast inter-individual variability in clinical manifestations, whereas it shares issues on the lack of sensitive diagnostics for early disease and infection with other mycobacterial diseases. based on extensive immunological expertise in leprosy, particularly regarding animal models, adams (imr-2020-085.r1) presents a historic overview identifying key immunological aspects of the immune response against m leprae based on different animal models (mostly mice, non-human primates, and armadillos) that have been used for leprosy research compelled by the inability to culture this mycobacterium in vitro. the generation of various knockout mice has not only provided more insights into which immunoregulatory mechanisms lead to susceptibility or protection, but also provide well-defined models for different parts of the disease spectrum including leprosy reactions which are difficult to study in humans. since an additional advantage of animal models is that dose, time, and site of infection are known, the genetically altered mice represent useful tools for assessment of new (chemoprophylactic) treatment regimens, vaccines, and diagnostics. van hooij and geluk (imr-2021-003) aim to identify phase-specific biomarkers to improve leprosy diagnostics by assessing studies published about the role of various cell subtypes associated with m leprae infection and the various disease states in which leprosy occurs in humans. taking the alleged route m leprae follows in the host, this leads them to conclude that the innate immune system is dominant in the initiation of nerve damage, an early disease manifestation, whereas the adaptive immune system further aggravates nerve damage and determines the type of leprosy. application of biomarkers associated with different forms of leprosy will improve leprosy diagnosis and treatment. a different view on the maneuvers of m leprae to evade protective host immunity is provided by oliveira and colleagues (imr-2021-002.r2). driven by the findings that genetic variations in enzymes related to central metabolism and mitophagic process, such as hif-1α, famin, prkn, and lrrk2, are associated with leprosy, they focus on mitochondria as target of suppression of host defense. it is presumed that mleprae reduces the generation of oxidative stress concomitantly lowering inflammasome activation and other pertinent mitochondrial signaling involved in innate immunity. these insights generate options for new drugs that block mitochondrial deactivation. buruli ulcer (bu) represents a neglected tropical skin disease manifesting as chronic wounds that can leave victims with major, life-long deformity and disability. the causative agent, m ulcerans, possesses a unique trait as, in contrast to other pathogenic mycobacteria, it produces mycolactone, a diffusible lipid factor with unique cytotoxic and immunomodulatory properties.49 an additional divergence compared to tb and leprosy is that epidemiologic and genetic analyses argue against human-to-human transmission. bcg is the only vaccine available that has been studied for bu prevention, but only conferred short-lasting protection.50 demangel (imr-2020-083.r1), completes this issue with a comprehensive review on the immunosuppressive properties of mycolactone including blockade of sec61, the host receptor mediating the immunomodulatory effects of mycolactone and thereby the virulence of m ulcerans. finally, fevereiro and colleagues (imr-2020-088.r1) elegantly review the most recent data on “buruli ulceromics”, that is, omics-based studies on buruli ulcer including gwas to depict the mechanism of m ulcerans infection. they describe the resemblance with and differences from host immune responses in other mycobacterioses. as has been shown for tb and leprosy, application of omics-based research provides promising options for buruli ulcer research which are required to render this disease truly negligible. together, this volume provides a wide-ranging update on current views of immunological mechanisms involved in mycobacterial infection and disease which display potential for translational research regarding development of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics. the comprised reviews will hopefully instigate innovative research activities aimed at developing novel therapeutic strategies for mycobacterial disease in humans and animals that are as inventive as their causative agents. the author declares no conflict of interest.",2021,"2023-07-03

inventive, but some are more daedalean than others since the end of 2019, when the world was struck by the covid-19 pandemic,1, 2 discussions regarding immunology seem not to be restricted to lecture halls and laboratories anymore, but have moved beyond the scientific community into public society. popular talk shows and social media platforms nowadays not sporadically contain (non-scientific) conversations about herd immunity, neutralizing antibodies, the r-number, t cell cross-reactivity, rapid tests, host-directed therapy (chloroquine), and, of course, vaccines. with respect to the latter, the post-covid-19 laymen attention focuses, besides on availability, on vaccine composition, regimen, trials, boosters, and efficacy, topics that, not too long ago, were considered far from appealing topics of conversation by non-scientist. to pull us out of the economically and socially devastating restrictions imposed on society by this global pandemic, the hope of the public is now directed on the new anti-covid-19 vaccines that are currently being rolled out in many countries across the world. taken this present-day extent of public attention for immunology into consideration, it should have become common knowledge by now that long-term investments in research of immunology (inseparably linked with vaccinology) of infectious diseases, including those caused by pathogenic mycobacteria, have provided vital contributions to the current capability to develop and produce covid-19 vaccines in <1 year. still, development of better diagnostics and improved vaccines has been relatively slow despite their protracted impact on the health of humans and animals as well as global economies. this controversy is reflecting the unpropitious funding situation of this research domain, which is quite disproportional with the number of casualties particularly in the case of tuberculosis (tb), a respiratory disease that, before 2020, has been more lethal than any other disease from a single infectious agent.3 however, in contrast to covid-19, which has severely hit europe and the usa as well, mycobacterial diseases mostly affect individuals in low- and middle-income countries (lmics). this volume of immunological reviews comprises papers that encompass (recent) findings on the immunology of mycobacterial diseases caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb), m leprae, m ulcerans, m avium, m absessus, m bovis, and m avium subspecies paratuberculosis, as well as immunity induced by the vaccine strain m bovis bacillus calmette-guérin (bcg), thereby illustrating the progress made in basic research on immunity to mycobacteria. this includes the role that classical and more recently discovered (t) cells play in these intriguing host-pathogen interactions as well as potential application thereof within vaccination strategies and as correlates of protection and disease in diagnostics. to unravel mechanisms of disease various “omics” technologies have contributed, leading to new insights regarding (prospective) diagnostics for4-8 as well as immune mechanisms of mycobacterial diseases.9, 10 in addition, it addresses the plethora of

the world health organization (who) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) as a pandemic disease caused by sars-cov-2 (previously known as 2019-ncov).1, 2 by the 19th of april, 2 241 778 confirmed patients were reported worldwide with 152 552 covid-19-related deaths.3 the covid-19 pandemic represents the most serious health crisis facing the modern world resulting in unprecedented efforts to contain this pandemic and its consequences.1 all the coronaviruses (covs) belong to the ‘coronaviridae’ family, which, consists of a group of enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded rna viruses with an extended field of original roots. the covs are genotypically and serologically classified into four genera: α, β, γ and δ-covs, of which, the α and β covs are capable of infecting humans.4 sars-cov-2 was recognized as a member of β-covs with a genome sequence similar to the bat cov and sars-cov-1.5, 6 sars-cov-2 is characterized by the presence of specific spike glycoprotein that shows strong binding affinity to the angiotensinogen-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors; however, it is worth mentioning that sars-cov-2 has 10-20 folds higher binding affinity to ace2 receptors compared with sars-cov-1.6, 7 generally, ace2 may be expressed in different parts of the human body including the lung, small intestine, colon, duodenum, kidney, testis, gallbladder, heart, oesophagus and urinary bladder, rendering these organs a potential target for the sars-cov-2.6, 8 interestingly, an old report by hamming et al.9 demonstrated the presence of ace2 in the basal cell layer of the epidermis continuing to the basal cell layer of the hair follicles, the smooth muscle cells that enclose the sebaceous glands and the eccrine glands. in the same setting, goren et al.10 postulated a hypothesis that androgen receptors may play a role in the severity of the covid-19 patients. this hypothesis was based on the disproportionate prevalence of severe covid-19 among children and adult females compared with adult males. besides, the ace2 activity has shown to decrease with the reduction of the androgen hormones.10 however, this theory is not yet proven. the sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious disease that is characterized by a basic reproductive value (r0) of 2–3.5, reflecting the capability of one patient to transmit the disease to 2–3 other persons.11 according to the who, sars-cov-2 is transmitted through respiratory droplets of infected person in either a direct (close contact with infected person) or indirect (fomites surrounding the infected persons or tools used during examination such as dermatoscope).12, 13 finally, hidden transmission from asymptomatic carriers was reported.14 there is a broad spectrum of manifestations in covid-19 patients (fever, dry cough, dyspnoea and myalgia with headache, nausea and diarrhoea being less frequent manifestations).1 the presentations are categorized into four categories: asymptomatic patients (1%); mild to moderate (81%); severe (14%); and critically ill patients (5%). the overall mortality rate is 2.3%.15 several viral infections are characterized by the presence of related cutaneous manifestations.16 a recent italian study of 88 covid-19 patients showed that 20.4% of the patients demonstrated cutaneous manifestation in the form of erythematous rash, urticaria and chickenpox-like vesicles mainly in the trunk with little or no itching. furthermore, the authors reported that those skin lesions were not correlated with disease severity.17 similarly, henry et al.18 reported that covid-19 patients may present with urticarial eruption without any respiratory symptoms (cough or fever). on the same hand, a covid-19 patient was misdiagnosed as dengue in thailand as the principal presentations were skin rash with petechiae and low platelet count.19 generally, galván casas et al.20 performed the first prospective study to classify the cutaneous manifestations of covid-19 into five major clincal patterns including pseudo-chilblain (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapules (47%), and livedo or necrosis (6%). in these settings, dermatologists should pay particular consideration to patients presenting with viral-like skin rash so as not to miss covid-19 cases.21 generally, skin is considered a part of the immune system as it acts as a shield against different environmental stimuli.22 in this setting, compromising the integrity of this barrier by lacerations, scratching, needling, pre-existing infections or diseases of skin, wounds and burns may facilitate the invasion by micro-organisms.23 therefore, dermatological patients may be at higher risk of sars-cov-2 either due the loss of the skin integrity by dermatological diseases or the immunosuppressive therapy used in the management of some diseases.24, 25 many patients may take advantage of the quarantine period to do some cosmetic procedures considering that the quarantine period is an appropriate opportunity for healing and downtime of the skin; however, it should be noted that fractionated ablative laser resurfacing may result in narrow columns of dermal injuries allowing for potential infection.26 additionally, micro-needling especially home ones may carry high risk of infection and viral autoinoculation.27 since the start of covid-19 pandemic, many measures and protocols have been taken to reduce the risk of spread of infection, to flatten the peak of the epidemic curve and to prepare the different healthcare facilities to the expected surge of covid-19 patients.28, 29 based on the chinese experience, only urgent dermatological surgeries should be performed, the capacity of the outpatient clinics should be reduced, all patients should be screened at the clinic entrance for fever or history of travel to endemic areas, and all patients should be wearing masks; however, it is worth mentioning that sometimes the use of masks for patients may be difficult as most of the high-risk carcinomas are located in face region. furthermore, doctors should wear mask, goggles, protective suits, head caps and gloves.30-32 generally, the majority of the dermatological outpatient visits are elective, thus, it is recommended to cancel all non-urgent visits and only urgent outpatient visits (including surgeries for malignancies) should be performed provided that adequate protective measures are followed.24, 28, 33, 34 furthermore, the authors recommended that practitioners at risk of covid-19 (60 years or older, immunocompromised, pregnant and comorbidities) should avoid contact with patients.33 on the same hand, hospital admission should only be preserved for patients with severe skin disease not responding to outpatient treatment.28 in conclusion, covid-19 has dramatically affected the dermatological practice; however, dermatologists should pay careful attention not to compromise (by cancelling or deferring) urgent and high-risk cases. one of the medical technologies that gained interest during the current pandemic is the telemedicine that allows the dermatologists to diagnose the patients remotely and prescribe proper treatment without compromising the social distancing role.35-39 there are two types of consultation in teledermatology either synchronous (which include real-time interaction between the patient and the physician) or asynchronous (in which the patients data are stored and then reviewed later by the physician).37. interestingly, smart phone technology (especially whatsapp) has been proposed to overcome the lack of teledermatology equipment in most of healthcare facilities; however, it may limited by the poor video and images quality, and medicolegal and privacy issues.39 moreover, covid-19 pandemic has a great impact on teaching and scientific activities; however, remote teaching of medical students and residents through online lectures, seminars and case discussion is safer compared with the classic methods during this critical time.40 immunosuppressants are mainly used in the dermatological practice for the management of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris and pyoderma gangrenosum.41, 42 however, their use during the current pandemic is a matter of debate as a result of lack of evidence about covid-19 risk in immunosuppressed patients.43, 44 conforti et al.,43 suggested that these immunosuppressant drugs may be associated with higher risk of opportunistic infections as they weaken the immune response. this suggestion was based on previous reports about the increased risk of swine influenza a (h1n1) infection or death in psoriatic patients using immunosuppressant drugs.45, 46 therefore, conforti et al.,43 proposed that the use of biologics should be weighted in endemic areas with the aim to limit and/or reduce the administration time of these drugs and to stop all immunosuppressants in patients suspected for having covid-19. similarly, a consensus of experts’ opinion from new zealand and australia advised the cessation of all immunosuppressants (except systemic corticosteroids that should not be suddenly stopped or reduced) in covid-19-confirmed patients for at least 4 weeks, while for patients with influenza-like symptoms, the dose of immunomodulators should be reduced or stopped for a period of 2 weeks. on the contrary, bashyam et al.47 reported that some biologics may even play a protective role and enhance the aberrant immune response to covid-19. this hypothesis was supported by bardazzi et al.,48 who reported their experience with the use of biologics for psoriatic patients in italy during the covid-19 pandemic. the authors demonstrated that only 24/176 psoriatic patients developed influenza-like symptoms, of which, only two patients (from the highly infected regions in italy) tested positive for sars-cov-2, while, the remaining 22 patients did not require testing for covid-19. however, it is worth mentioning that those two patients were instructed to temporarily stop biologic therapy.48 interestingly, mihai et al.49 reported covid-19 in a 57-years-old woman with systemic sclerosis. the patient was on tocilizumab (interleukin-6 blocker) for the management of her systemic sclerosis and had a higher risk of severe course of covid-19 due to the associated comorbidities (insulin-dependent type-2 diabetes and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease); however, the patient showed just mild symptoms for 10 days and the tocilizumab was resumed 4 days after the negative sars-cov-2 test.49 several other authors reported that a case-by-case evaluation may be more convenient as some of these biologics may not be harmful during the covid-19 pandemic but even theoretically beneficial and their cessation may be associated with the development of anti-drug antibody.50-52 generally, the recommendation for the immunomodulators use should be based on the mechanism of action of each of drug and its associated risk of infection.53, 54 for example, tumour necrosis factor-α (tnf-α) inhibitors are associated with similar risk of infection by seasonal and h1n1 influenza as compared to normal population55; however, it was associated with up to 7% increased rate of overall infection compared with placebo (except for etanercept).53 theoretically, tnf-α inhibitors may play a protective role through modulation of inflammation and decreasing alveolar damage as the pneumonia caused by covid-19 is usually associated with cytokine storm with increased levels of tnf-α and other cytokines.56, 57 furthermore, adalimumab (tnf-α inhibitor) is currently under trial in china for the treatment of covid-19 patients.58 considering interleukin-17 blockers (il-17), it was associated with 11% increased risk of overall infection; however, major part of this infection was monilial infections. they are characterized by a paradoxical role in viral infections depending on the nature of the virus, where it may either enhance the host’s aberrant immune response or it may aggravate the disease.47 theoretically, covid-19 patients may benefit from il-17 blockers especially patients with higher plasma levels of interleukin-17.59 on the other hand, corticosteroids should be used with great caution as it was associated with delayed viral clearance in sars and mers patients but not with increased mortality.56 therefore, routine use of systemic steroids in the management of covid-19 patients is not recommended by the who.60 the american academy of dermatology recommends that patients on biologic therapy without suspicious or confirmed covid-19 and patients considering the initiation of their biologic therapy should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and a shared decision (between the physician and the patient) should be considered based on the risk versus the benefit of such therapy, while patients who test positive for covid-19 should consider postponing or cessation of their biologic therapy.44 similarly, the european task force on atopic dermatitis stated that immunomodulators (including immunosuppressants) should be continued in patients with atopic dermatitis; however, patients should take care of hygienic procedures such as hand washing. considering atopic dermatitis patients with positive tests for covid-19, careful risk assessment should be performed before cessation of immunomodulators as the abrupt stoppage of these drugs may be associated with exacerbations of the condition and comorbidities (including asthma, kidney disease and allergy), and topical therapy should be considered during the pause period.61 cancer patients may be at a higher risk for the development of infectious disease with a 3.5 folds increased risk of developing covid-19 adverse events including the need for mechanical ventilation and/or death due to their immunocompromised state that is associated to the nature and the aggressiveness of the neoplasm and the anti-cancer treatment.1 only one report in the literature discussed the adherence of patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma to hedgehog inhibitors during the covid-19 pandemic. the report included 37 patients, of which, only three patients interrupted the treatment as a result of severe comorbidities, while all the remaining patients either attended the outpatient clinic for the monthly prescription or used a modified treatment scheme to prolong their treatment. it is noteworthy to mention that there is no evidence against the continuation of these drugs during the current pandemic.62 on the other hand, immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis) are considered one of the promising treatment options for patients with advanced melanoma.63 noteworthy, the susceptibility of patients taking icis to infectious diseases has not been thoroughly discussed in the literature. the use of icis during the current pandemic may represent a matter of concern as a result of the potential overlap between the sars-cov-2-related pneumonia and the pulmonary toxicity of the icis (however, it should be mentioned that this pneumological toxicity is a rare event ranging from 2.5% to 5% in case of icis monotherapy to 7–10% in case of combination therapy). furthermore, the synergism between the icis mechanism of action and the sars-cov-2 pathogenesis may potentiate the pathological effect of covid-19. in this setting, the use of icis should be carefully weighted according to a case-by-case scenario.64 considering squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, the same precautions (discussed before) should be followed if immunomodulators are considered for treatment. arora et al.65 raised the concern that patients with rheumatologic skin disease may be at higher risk for covid-19 either due to the disease itself or its medications. furthermore, some rheumatological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis may be associated with new-onset or reactivation of arthritis during the remission following some viral infections (including coronavirus).65 considering sexually transmitted diseases (stds), the quarantine and social distancing measures may not only affect physical and psychosocial health of the individuals but also the sexual health, where, these measures may lower the opportunity for casual sex that in turn might reduce the incidence of stds such as syphilis, gonorrhoea and chlamydia in the future.66 furthermore, it is also recommended not to cancel the visits of std patients (it can be performed using teledermatology or virtual clinics) to avoid the consequences including the further spread of the disease. several skin complications may result from the prolonged use of personal protective equipment as a result of hyperhydration effect, friction and allergic contact reactions.25 the prevalence of skin damage resulting from wearing protective equipment was 97.0% among healthcare workers including lesions of the nasal bridge (83.1%), hands, cheek and forehead.67 furthermore, excessive hand washing with detergents and/or disinfectants may cause contact dermatitis.25 in these settings, a consensus of chinese experts on the protection of the skin and mucous membranes was released recommending that hand washing or gloves decontamination should be limited to the following moments: before touching the patients or any aseptic procedure and after exposure to body fluids, touching the patient or any of the patients’ items. furthermore, they recommended the use of ethanol for hand hygiene and applying hand cream following each time of hand hygiene if possible. however, in case of latex gloves it is recommended to wear a cotton gloves below and to use moisturizers with topical glucocorticoid cream. similarly, it is recommended to use a properly fitting mask and goggles and apply moisturizers or gel at contact areas.68 furthermore, yin et al.69 suggested the use of double protection (benzalkonium chloride paste on the nasal bridge followed by hydrocolloid dressing) before wearing the n95 masks. many vaccines had been injected intralesionally to treat warts, as bcg, which, results in il-12 increase and il-4 decrease and mmr vaccine, which, is capable of stimulating the cell-mediated and humoral immune response.70 children are characterized by significantly lower risks for developing severe form of covid-19 with lower mortality rates compared to adult population and this may be due to the global active viral immunization of children.71, 72 based on these observations, the vaccines that have been used to treat viral skin lesions can theoretically be a potential treatment option of covid-19; however, further studies are required to confirm the role of vaccines in covid 19 prophylaxis and/or treatment. there is a strong rationale for the use of antimalarial drugs [chloroquine (cq) and hydroxychloroquine] to treat infections. these drugs are considered to be immunomodulators as they reduce t-cell activation, suppress the toll-like receptors (tlr) signalling and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production by t cells and b cells.73 in animal studies, cq was capable of inhibiting sars-cov spread either prior to or after infection, suggesting that cq might have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages.74 in this setting, chinese experts recommend that patients with covid-19 (mild, moderate or severe) and without contraindications to chloroquine should be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice daily for 10 days.75 however, these drugs should be used with caution and under medical supervision to avoid macular retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders that may be life-threatening.76 ivermectin is an fda-approved antiparasitic drug that is characterized by anti-viral activity. an ex vivo study demonstrated that ivermectin is able to produce approximately 5000 folds reduction in the viral rna in the treated cells compared with the control samples. these promising results should promote in vivo studies.77 these recommendations are based on the findings of the current review, the protocols in the dermatology department in our universities, and the measures recommended by cdc (centre for disease control and prevention). table 1

coronavirus disease-2019 (covid-19) as a pandemic disease caused by sars-cov-2 (previously known as 2019-ncov).1, 2 by the 19th of april, 2 241 778 confirmed patients were reported worldwide with 152 552 covid-19-related deaths.3 the covid-19 pandemic represents the most serious health crisis facing the modern world resulting in unprecedented efforts to contain this pandemic and its consequences.1 all the coronaviruses (covs) belong to the ‘coronaviridae’ family, which, consists of a group of enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded rna viruses with an extended field of original roots. the covs are genotypically and serologically classified into four genera: α, β, γ and δ-covs, of which, the α and β covs are capable of infecting humans.4 sars-cov-2 was recognized as a member of β-covs with a genome sequence similar to the bat cov and sars-cov-1.5, 6 sars-cov-2 is characterized by the presence of specific spike glycoprotein that shows strong binding affinity to the angiotensinogen-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptors; however, it is worth mentioning that sars-cov-2 has 10-20 folds higher binding affinity to ace2 receptors compared with sars-cov-1.6, 7 generally, ace2 may be expressed in different parts of the human body including the lung, small intestine, colon, duodenum, kidney, testis, gallbladder, heart, oesophagus and urinary bladder, rendering these organs a potential target for the sars-cov-2.6, 8 interestingly, an old report by hamming et al.9 demonstrated the presence of ace2 in the basal cell layer of the epidermis continuing to the basal cell layer of the hair follicles, the smooth muscle cells that enclose the sebaceous glands and the eccrine glands. in the same setting, goren et al.10 postulated a hypothesis that androgen receptors may play a role in the severity of the covid-19 patients. this hypothesis was based on the disproportionate prevalence of severe covid-19 among children and adult females compared with adult males. besides, the ace2 activity has shown to decrease with the reduction of the androgen hormones.10 however, this theory is not yet proven. the sars-cov-2 is a highly contagious disease that is characterized by a basic reproductive value (r0) of 2–3.5, reflecting the capability of one patient to transmit the disease to 2–3 other persons.11 according to the who, sars-cov-2 is transmitted

eruption without any respiratory symptoms (cough or fever). on the same hand, a covid-19 patient was misdiagnosed as dengue in thailand as the principal presentations were skin rash with petechiae and low platelet count.19 generally, galván casas et al.20 performed the first prospective study to classify the cutaneous manifestations of covid-19 into five major clincal patterns including pseudo-chilblain (19%), other vesicular eruptions (9%), urticarial lesions (19%), maculopapules (47%), and livedo or necrosis (6%). in these settings, dermatologists should pay particular

the invasion by micro-organisms.23 therefore, dermatological patients may be at higher risk of sars-cov-2 either due the loss of the skin integrity by dermatological diseases or the immunosuppressive therapy used in the management of some diseases.24, 25 many patients may take advantage of the quarantine period to do some cosmetic procedures considering that the quarantine period is an appropriate

option of covid-19; however, further studies are required to confirm the role of vaccines in covid 19 prophylaxis and/or treatment. there is a strong rationale for the use of antimalarial drugs [chloroquine (cq) and hydroxychloroquine] to treat infections. these drugs are considered to be immunomodulators as they reduce t-cell activation, suppress the toll-like receptors (tlr) signalling and inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokines production by t cells and b cells.73 in animal studies, cq was capable of inhibiting sars-cov spread either prior to or after infection, suggesting that cq might have both prophylactic and therapeutic advantages.74 in this setting, chinese experts recommend that patients with covid-19 (mild, moderate or severe) and without contraindications to chloroquine should be treated with 500 mg chloroquine twice daily for 10 days.75 however, these drugs should be used with caution and under medical supervision to avoid macular retinopathy and cardiovascular disorders that may be life-threatening.76 ivermectin is an fda-approved antiparasitic drug that is characterized by anti-viral activity. an ex vivo study demonstrated that ivermectin is able to produce approximately 5000 folds reduction in the viral rna in the treated cells compared with the control samples. these promising results should promote in vivo studies.77 these recommendations are based on the findings of the current review, the protocols in the dermatology department in our universities, and the measures recommended by cdc (centre for disease control and prevention). table 1 shows a summary of recommendations based on the findings of the current review."

from burden of lifestyle diseases has recently been discussed [1-5]. since human health, environmental changes and animal welfare are closely related (i.e. the 'one health' or 'planetary health' approach), such studies require close interdisciplinary collaboration including medical doctors, veterinarians, zoologists, climate researchers, ecologists, biologists and anthropologists [6]. the ongoing coronavirus 2019 (covid-19) pandemic is a sobering example of the urgent need for global interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating human and animal health with environmental sustainability and ecosystem health. to begin with, it is worth noting that there is simply nothing uniquely chinese about the covid-19 outbreak. the explanations for why so many epidemics seem to arise in china may not only be cultural, but also a matter of its current economic geography paired with the close interface between wildlife, livestock and humans [7]. this is abundantly clear if we compare china to the united states, or europe, when the latter were hubs of global production and mass industrial employment. the geography of blame, naming a germ after a country or ethnic group, has often been a symbol of helplessness during previous pandemics, detracting from the global aspect and unfairly labelling a country or ethnic group as being solely responsible. ironically, the ‘spanish flu’ pandemic of 1918 likely originated from a farm community in south-western kansas [8]. whilst previous pandemics were mainly linked to crises resulting from wars, the covid-19 pandemic is linked to a crisis based on environmental pollution, exploitation of the natural world, wildlife abuse and subsequent cumulative consequences on human health. the transformative impacts of the covid-19 pandemic on human welfare, socio-economic and political structures are enormous. the planet is already experiencing an extraordinary loss of biodiversity (an ongoing sixth mass extinction) linked to human activity: illegal wildlife trade, habitat destruction, pollution, global warming and over-consumption of a sugar-rich high-protein diet, superimposed on population growth [9]. as gut microbiota regulate immune defences against respiratory tract influenza a infection [10], the role of the foodome in the severity of respiratory involvement during covid-19 infection requires attention. furthermore, a 'normal' food supply system has developed as factory farming, with massive numbers of livestock and poultry kept at high density, creating an environment ripe for the genesis of new viral diseases [11]. climate change can impact both vector-borne diseases, and even the evolution and progression of viruses, such as influenza a [12], whilst atmospheric pollution, due to small airborne particles, may also enhance spread of sars-cov-2 [13]. thus, anthropogenic environmental changes are redefining the nature of 21st century pathologies [9], and pandemics, such as covid-19, may not be an exception in years to come. it is estimated that in the united states alone, three out of four new infectious diseases have emerged from human–animal contact [14] and zoonoses are responsible for >2 billion cases of human illness and >2 million human deaths each year [15]. whilst the origin of the sars-cov-2 virus is still not certain, most studies suggest it originated in bats and infected people were exposed via the sale of wild meat at a wet market in wuhan, china [16]. indeed, bats are believed to be one of the more common wildlife species that carry zoonotic disease potential for domestic animals and humans. their special flight physiology, with high body temperatures, may have perfectly adapted viruses [17, 18] to survive a febrile status in sars-cov-2-infected human patients. over the last century, human activity has destroyed natural habitats and wildlife to develop more anthropocentric landscapes [7], providing the basis for emerging disease 'hotspots' and the spillover of new viral zoonoses [9]. exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans and has increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission [19]. in bats stressed by entrapment, habitat destruction, infections and climate change, spillover of the virus to other species is more likely to occur. indeed, intestines of virus-infected bats that were also co-infected with fungus contained on average 60-fold more coronavirus rna than bats with virus alone [20]. since sars-cov-2 recently was shown to infect intestinal cells of bats and the virus replicate in human intestinal organoids [21], there is a possibility of transmission to humans by contact with bat faeces, without need for an intermediate vector. we contend that lessons from nature (biomimetics) provide solutions for understanding, treating and preventing emergent diseases. biomimetic solutions, generated from insights from the natural world, may provide ingenious natural solutions not only for chronic noncommunicable lifestyle-related diseases [1] but also for zoonotic diseases. it seems likely that the major therapeutic dilemma in severe covid-19 infection is the combination of an inappropriate inflammatory response (cytokine storm) with reduced innate antiviral defence mechanisms [22]. the increased susceptibility to severe disease observed in the elderly and individuals with burden of lifestyle disease, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, argues for impaired interferon (ifn) antiviral host defence mechanisms. although there is a relatively large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, viral diseases in bats are mild [18]. since bats have developed unique mechanisms to control both excessive inflammation and having robust interferon antiviral responses [23], they may provide a biomimetic solution for the covid-19 pandemic. sars-cov-2 infection is characterized by a lack of robust type i/iii ifn signatures from infected cell lines [22] and patients with severe covid-19 demonstrate a profoundly impaired ifn-i response as compared to mild or moderate cases [24]. in covid-19 infection, orf3b – one of the viral proteins which is dominantly expressed – is a potent inf antagonist [25]. coronaviruses are known to have multiple other mechanisms for evasion of the host immune response. bats share many of the immunological features of other mammals but an understanding of the unique host–viral interaction in bats may help understand the pathogenesis of emerging zoonoses in humans. the long co-evolutionary history of bats and viruses has led to immunological adaptation of bats and the resident viruses allowing for apathogenic infection. some of these unique immunological differences in bats that have been studied include constitutive expression of inf-signalling molecules, impaired formation of inflammasomes, absence of a number of nk-cell receptors, lack of somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin heavy chain genes and an altered inf-stimulated gene profile, which is not associated with an acute inflammatory response [26]. the links between 'trained immunity' after live vaccinations, such as bacillus calmette–guérin (bcg), and reduced severity of sars-cov-2 infection [27] as well recent positive results in an open-label randomized trial of covid-19-infected patients with a triple regimen including inf beta-1b [28], support observations made in bats that a robust inf system plays a key role in protection against sars-cov-2. further understanding of evolutionary adaptation of both host and symbiont/pathogen may provide insights into both pathophysiology and potential therapeutic pathways. the current sars-cov-2 pandemic is the best proof of the necessity for recreation of sustainable human and ecosystem health [29], and for an increased protection of wildlife in its natural and undisturbed habitat, away from close human contact. a biomimetic approach would allow us to learn from animals that through evolution have managed to regulate viral persistence, and to develop novel antiviral drugs based on the planet’s own botanical medicine cabinet. a biomimetic initiative needs prompt action as loss of species diversity, habitat destruction and pollution will prevent this opportunity to learn from the biochemical

Medicine",NA,"0954-6820","10.1111/joim.13195","https://doi.org/10.1111/joim.13195","bacillus calmette–guérin (bcg) is derived from mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. the bacterium was cultivated between 1908 and 1921, and as demonstrated almost a century later [1], during these years of in vitro growth on solid culture media, it lost large regions of chromosomal dna, some of which encoded important virulence determinants. this loss of virulence made it harmless enough to allow administration of the vaccine to newborns, and it has become the world’s most widely used vaccine. today, it is recommended by the who for the protection of young children against the most severe and deadly forms of tuberculosis [2]. the never-fading interest in bcg is reflected in pubmed-listed citations emerging from the simple search ‘bcg’ revealing an accelerating ‘doubling-rate’ from 220 in 1950 to 400 around the millennial turn to 800 articles in 2020. just a brief dip in numbers of publications can be noted in the late 50s, probably as a result of the discovery of antibiotics and the premature conclusion that tb was history at that time. in december 2018, a conference was held at the institut pasteur de lille in lille, france, the birthplace of bcg. this was the second international workshop dedicated exclusively to bcg and was organized to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the first subculture of m. bovis, which finally led to the bcg. the conference gathered speakers from 17 different countries in europe, the americas, africa, asia and australia. all continents were represented, and the presentations covered a wide range of subjects, including the history of bcg, the place of bcg in the fight against mycobacterial diseases, genomics of bcg, next-generation bcgs, off-target effects of bcg and the effects of bcg in cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. this initially unexpected width of beneficial effects that bcg has unveiled over the years has led to major new discoveries and resulted in treatments against a wide variety of human diseases beyond tuberculosis and leprosy and ranging from cancer to diabetes. the full potential of bcg is only recently being systematically explored, including the possibility that bcg may have a protective effect on coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) [3], which was not heard of at the time of the conference. the underlying mechanisms of this variety of effects are currently an area of intense investigation throughout the world and has greatly contributed to the concept of ‘trained immunity’ [4]. the lille bcg conference inspired us to prepare a special issue for journal of internal medicine by asking some of the speakers at the conference for contributions. in the current issue of jim, we present four articles derived from work presented at the conference and two additional papers. early studies from sweden and france by naeslund and albert calmette himself demonstrated that childhood mortality was reduced after the introduction of bcg for reasons not related to tuberculosis. these findings have later been confirmed in studies from africa by stabell-benn and colleagues [5], who in this issue of jim present a meta-analysis on the correlation between bcg scarring and childhood survival. the study concludes that the presence of a bcg scar is correlated with reduced mortality in children in guinea–bissau and suggests that an early time-point for bcg vaccination (during the first month of life) should be assured in national vaccination programmes. the importance of scar formation is also highlighted by the finding that the formation of a scar, which results from a short period of replication of the bcg at the injection site and the accompanying inflammatory infiltration, is much more strongly associated with the reduction in childhood mortality than just the administration of the vaccine. finally, the consideration of revaccination of scar-negative children is discussed as a means to enhance the coverage of effective bcg vaccination in vulnerable populations. another unexpected effect of bcg that has been in clinical practice for a very long time is its effect as a cancer therapeutic. it is widely used to treat bladder cancer (the vaccine is repeatedly instilled into the bladder) and has shown to be effective in reducing recurrence of noninvasive bladder cancer. repeated injections of bcg have long been applied in veterinary science as well, to treat equine sarcoids, ‘white horse melanoma’, and here, lee and co-authors elucidate the clinical and molecular aspects of the use of bcg to treat melanoma in humans [6]. the review surveys the existing knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the promising effect of bcg as anticancer therapy, including both adaptive immune responses and epigenetic reprogramming associated with trained immunity. the work further summarizes the efficacy and safety of several studies on intralesional bcg therapy for melanoma and compares it with immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated melanoma, concluding that future studies should explore the possible synergistic effects of these approaches. type i diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, in which a dysregulated t-cell response causes the degradation of insulin-producing islets of langerhans in the pancreas. faustman presents her work on how the metabolic defects observed in immune cells in type i diabetes can be restored in their function through repeated bcg administration [7]. the work expands on the implications of bcg therapy for a number of autoimmune disorders. a mechanism that is discussed for the observed effects involves an increasing number of beneficial regulatory t cells as a result of bcg administration. a special issue on bcg should of course include work that discusses its use against tuberculosis, and lindestam arlehamn and colleagues provide a comprehensive summary of factors known to contribute to the variable antituberculosis efficacy of bcg [8]. administration routes different from the standard intradermal injection are discussed, including animal studies on intravenous injection and aerosol administration, also providing important information on how the efficacy of bcg could be improved. the work further summarizes the search for immune correlates of bcg protection, which remain enigmatic. of course, there are a number of tb vaccine candidates and harris and co-workers provide an overview of the highly diverse candidate tuberculosis vaccines in the current pipeline [9]. the work also performs a systematic review of mathematical modelling papers exploring the epidemiological impact of novel tuberculosis vaccines. modelling studies may inform vaccine trials to optimize

century‐old vaccine can contribute to modern medicine bacillus calmette–guérin (bcg) is derived from mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis. the bacterium was cultivated between 1908 and 1921, and as demonstrated almost a century later [1], during these years of in vitro growth on solid culture media, it lost large regions of chromosomal dna, some of which encoded important virulence determinants. this loss of virulence made it harmless enough to allow administration of the vaccine to newborns, and it has become the world’s most widely used vaccine. today, it is recommended by the who for the protection of young children against the most severe and deadly forms of tuberculosis [2]. the never-fading interest in bcg is reflected in pubmed-listed citations emerging from the simple search ‘bcg’ revealing an accelerating ‘doubling-rate’ from 220 in 1950 to 400 around the millennial turn to 800 articles in 2020. just a brief dip in numbers of publications can be noted in the late 50s, probably as a result of the discovery of antibiotics and the premature conclusion that tb was history at that time. in december 2018, a conference was held at the institut pasteur de lille in lille, france, the birthplace of bcg. this was the second international workshop dedicated exclusively to bcg and was organized to celebrate the 110th anniversary of the first subculture of m. bovis, which finally led to the bcg. the conference gathered speakers from 17 different countries in europe, the americas, africa, asia and australia. all continents were represented, and the presentations covered a wide range of subjects, including the history of bcg, the place of bcg in the fight against mycobacterial diseases, genomics of bcg, next-generation bcgs, off-target effects of bcg and the effects of bcg in cancer, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. this initially unexpected width of beneficial effects that bcg has unveiled over the years has led to major new discoveries and resulted in treatments against a wide variety of human diseases beyond tuberculosis and leprosy and ranging from cancer to diabetes. the full potential of bcg is only recently being systematically explored, including the possibility that bcg may have a protective effect on coronavirus disease 19 (covid-19) [3], which was not heard of at the time of the conference. the underlying mechanisms of this variety of effects are currently an area of intense investigation throughout the world and has greatly contributed to the concept of ‘trained immunity’ [4]. the lille bcg conference inspired us to prepare a special issue for journal of internal medicine by asking some of the speakers at the conference for contributions. in the current issue of jim, we present four articles derived from work presented at the conference and two additional papers. early studies from sweden and france by naeslund and albert calmette himself demonstrated that childhood mortality was reduced after the introduction of bcg for reasons not related to tuberculosis. these findings have later been confirmed in studies from africa by stabell-benn and colleagues [5], who in this issue of jim present a meta-analysis on the correlation between bcg scarring and childhood survival. the study concludes that the presence of a bcg scar is correlated with reduced mortality in children in guinea–bissau and suggests that an early time-point for bcg vaccination (during the first month of life) should be assured in national vaccination programmes. the importance of scar formation is also highlighted by the finding that the formation of a scar, which results from a short period of replication of the bcg at the injection site and the accompanying inflammatory infiltration, is much more strongly associated with the reduction in childhood mortality than just the administration of the vaccine. finally, the consideration of revaccination of scar-negative children is discussed as a means to enhance the coverage of effective bcg vaccination in vulnerable populations. another unexpected effect of bcg that has been in clinical practice for a very long time is its effect as a cancer therapeutic. it is widely used to treat bladder cancer (the vaccine is repeatedly instilled into the bladder) and has shown to be effective in reducing recurrence of noninvasive bladder cancer. repeated injections of bcg have long been applied in veterinary science as well, to treat equine sarcoids, ‘white horse melanoma’, and here, lee and co-authors elucidate the clinical and molecular aspects of the use of bcg to treat melanoma in humans [6]. the review surveys the existing knowledge of cellular and molecular mechanisms behind the promising effect of bcg as anticancer therapy, including both adaptive immune responses and epigenetic reprogramming associated with trained immunity. the work further summarizes the efficacy and safety of several studies on intralesional bcg therapy for melanoma and compares it with immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated melanoma, concluding that future studies should explore the possible synergistic effects of these approaches. type i diabetes is an autoimmune disorder, in which a dysregulated t-cell response causes the degradation of insulin-producing islets of langerhans in the pancreas. faustman presents her work on how the metabolic defects observed in immune cells in type i diabetes can be restored in their function through repeated bcg administration [7]. the work expands on the implications of bcg therapy for a number of autoimmune disorders. a mechanism that is discussed for the observed effects involves an increasing number of beneficial regulatory t cells as a result of bcg administration. a special issue on bcg should of course include work that discusses its use against tuberculosis, and lindestam arlehamn and colleagues provide a comprehensive summary of factors known to contribute to the variable antituberculosis efficacy of bcg [8]. administration routes different from the standard intradermal injection are discussed, including animal studies on intravenous injection and aerosol administration, also providing important information on how the efficacy of bcg could be improved. the work further summarizes the search for immune correlates of bcg protection, which remain enigmatic. of course, there are a number of tb vaccine candidates and harris and co-workers provide an overview of the highly diverse candidate tuberculosis vaccines in the current pipeline [9]. the work also performs a systematic review of mathematical modelling papers exploring the epidemiological impact of novel tuberculosis vaccines. modelling studies may inform vaccine trials to optimize delivery strategy and determine population-level impact and cost-efficacy. the conclusion of this work is that there is an increasing need for discovery and development of early pipeline candidates and clinical trial capacity to meet the need for effective methods to combat the tuberculosis epidemic. finally, in a perspective article, the possible relationship between national bcg vaccination programmes and covid-19 is presented [10]. the analysis arrives at the hypothesis that a high population coverage of bcg given to newborns results in heterologous herd immunity, which can protect a population against uncontrolled spread of covid-19. in summary, the century-old vaccine bcg is still one of the world’s most widely used vaccines, although it is suboptimal for the prevention of

it presents with symptoms similar to kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. of significance is that some adult patients may present in a dental practice reporting of loss of taste. in a case series of patients hospitalised in italy, the authors reported taste disorders in 10% of cases (dysgeusia 8.5% and ageusia 1.7%) and mixed taste and olfactory disorders in another 20% of patients (giacomelli et al., 2020). a young child may be brought in with a red tongue as a primary symptom of covid-19. in most cases, individuals are usually considered infectious while they have symptoms; how infectious individuals are, depends on the severity of their symptoms and stage of their illness. however, it is now widely recognised of possible infectivity prior to the onset of symptoms. virus shedding, as detected in the mouth or nose, could be present prior to onset of symptoms. a pcr test can determine whether the tested person is infected with sars-cov-2 and considered to be able to transmit the disease (a positive test) or is negative for the virus. patients seeking emergency care could be assessed by telephone and/or video in order to triage the patients’ initial complaint. many patients with oral problems can be managed with advice and treatment with analgesia and antibiotics. a follow-up telephone/video review within 3–7 days should be arranged for reassurance. however, a patient may need a dental visit for an emergency extraction, incision and drainage of a dental abscess, or for urgent visual oral examination for symptoms suspicious of oral cancer (e.g. a non-healing oral ulcer). when planning emergency treatment, the dentists should avoid or minimise operations that can produce droplets or aerosols (meng, hua, & bian, 2020). management of dental emergencies during covid-19 lockdown is beyond the scope of this publication and dentists would find guidelines circulated by nhs education for scotland useful (www.sdcep.org.uk). oral diseases have a significant interplay with systemic health especially among the elderly (jin et al., 2015). when managing the elderly, who may be in self-isolation during the covid outbreak a consultation with the patient's gp would be desirable before prescribing over the phone. to minimise spread and protect staff, initial risk assessment for covid status where possible should take place by phone, before making an appointment to visit the surgery. when booking emergency dental appointments, having a checklist of covid-19 symptoms at the reception may help to inform the dentist about symptomatic patients, to postpone non-urgent therapies and to direct such patients to hospital centres equipped for handling infected subjects and their relatives, living together. patients may be reluctant to discuss symptoms related to oral cancer and may postpone visiting a dentist during the coronavirus outbreak. arduino, conrotto, and broccoletti, (2020) in this journal have recently highlighted the issue of missed diagnoses of oral cancer that may later present in advanced stages. care should be taken not to miss oral malignancies due to surgery closures. according to current evidence, covid-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. dental surgery environments and procedures convey higher risks of transmission. an oral examination can generate an aerosol. aerosol generating procedures (agp) present risk of aerosolised transmission and high-speed drilling and ultrasonic scalers are particularly considered agps. other agps include extractions, incision and drainage of a dental abscess. coronaviruses can survive on surfaces (inanimate objects) and can remain viable for 3–5 days, dependent on the surface type, worst being plastics. fortunately, the infectivity decreases with time. dental patients could have a strong urge to spit after a procedure. covid-19 has been found in infected saliva (to et al., 2020); patient spitting could enhance the spread of the covid-19 within the dental premises. the same precautions should apply for all patients regardless of case status (positive, carrier or negative) during the period of sustained covid-19 transmission. hand hygiene should be practised and extended to exposed forearms. it is important to carry out hand hygiene after each patient contact. the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (ppe) will protect the dentist and staff from contamination in most circumstances. the ppe to be used in dental practices should be in line with the national recommendations given by the government chief dental officer or the professional organisation to which the dentist may belong to. for undertaking any direct patient care, dentists and dental surgery assistants and other oral health professionals are advised to wear, disposable gloves, aprons, eye protection and face shields where there is a risk of saliva, blood, other body fluids, secretions or excretions splashing into the face and eyes. sessional use of some ppe, other than hand gloves, may be rational. challacombe, kirk-bayley, sunkaraneni, and combes (2020) propose the use of 10 ml of povidone iodine (pvp-i) 0.5% solution - an effective virucide- applied as a mouth rinse for all patients (in those without contraindications to its use eg. history of allergy to pvp, thyroid disease etc) requiring dental treatment during the current covid-19 pandemic, just prior to treatment. decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed after each patient and should be carried out as per practice protocols. decontamination of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in aerosols (liu et al., 2020). it is generally advisable to avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air. all non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be removed from reception and waiting areas. careful and thorough decontamination practice of laboratory items (e.g. impressions, prostheses) remains the responsibility of dental practices before any such items are dispatched to dental laboratories, in order to prevent all types of cross-infection. demographic data on the current covid-19 pandemic suggest that the disease incidence and observed fatality proportion of cases vary widely in different parts of the world. bacillus calmette–guérin (bcg) vaccination status has been implicated as providing some immune protection to vaccinated communities. bcg utilises a weakened strain of mycobacterium bovis to vaccinate against tuberculosis. many countries began bcg vaccination programmes in the 1940s, and in particular, the commonwealth countries have continued this public health practice to vaccinate babies at birth or at school entry. between 1980 and 2007 several countries have ceased their bcg vaccination campaigns notably in europe, spain, denmark austria, germany, the isle of man, slovenia, uk, finland and france, and some countries have not had a universal bcg vaccination policy, for example italy, usa, lebanon, the netherland and belgium. a global map (figure 1) displaying bcg vaccination policy by country has been published (zwerling et al., 2011; zwerling & pai, 2011). using european data, hegarty, sfakianos, giannarini, dinardo, and kamat (2020) and global data miller et al. (2020) have shown considerable overlap with the map of countries with and without a national programme of bcg vaccination and the incidence of covid-19 infection. they speculate that countries with bcg vaccination programmes have far fewer coronavirus cases (by a factor 10), compared to where bcg programmes are no longer deployed. for example, italy, where the covid-19 mortality is very high, never implemented universal bcg vaccination. portugal which had an effective bcg vaccination policy demonstrated a low incidence of covid-19 and fewer deaths, than neighbouring spain. bcg vaccination has shown to stimulate the innate immune system to develop “memory,” termed trained immunity, which helps to eliminate various non-mycobacterium infections including influenza (covián et al., 2019). in view of bcg vaccine's heterologous beneficial effect against non-tuberculosis infections (miller et al., 2020), the question has been raised “whether bcg may enhance one's immunity against covid-19.” there are two trials under way studying the effect of bcg vaccination to increase resistance to infections in the elderly population and to try and to help prevent severe covid-19 infection in healthcare workers: brace in australia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04327206] and bcg-corona in the netherlands [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04328441). a lot of pharma companies are working on vaccines and the development of those vaccines are at various stages. on 23rd april, who announced that seven vaccines have now been approved for human testing through clinical trials (world health organization, 2020). of the seven, 3 are being tested in china, one in the uk, two in usa and one in germany. the university of oxford has taken the lead with a double-blind rct testing their chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine, which uses an adenovirus vaccine vector and the sars-cov-2 spike protein. the trial vaccine is being tested on close to 1,100 healthy volunteers and using a vaccine against meningococcus as a control. a timeframe for vaccine development of 12 to 18 month is needed but it is believed that an effective candidate may be announced sooner. equal distribution of the vaccine around the world would remain a challenge. as means of protecting dental staff and patients, triaging patients over the telephone or video systems, room ventilation, appropriate ppe, sanitization of protective apparel is recommended. proper use and disinfection of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in aerosols (liu et al., 2020). relatives or friends accompanying patients to a dental practice should be restricted to essential visitors only, such as parents of paediatric patients. at patient reception areas, distancing measures should be carried out—ensuring a distance of two metres is kept. dentists should keep up to date with and have regard to the latest advice from government, the health service and the chief medical (dental) officer. the position may change daily and therefore it is important to check that advice regularly. none.",2020,"2023-07-03 03:14:52","2023-07-03

symptoms related to oral cancer and may postpone visiting a dentist during the coronavirus outbreak. arduino, conrotto, and broccoletti, (2020) in this journal have recently highlighted the issue of missed diagnoses of oral cancer that may later present in advanced stages. care should be taken not to miss oral malignancies due to surgery closures. according to current evidence, covid-19 virus is primarily transmitted between people through respiratory droplets and contact routes. dental surgery environments and procedures convey higher risks of transmission. an oral examination can generate an aerosol. aerosol generating procedures (agp) present risk of aerosolised transmission and high-speed drilling and ultrasonic scalers are particularly considered agps. other agps include extractions, incision and drainage of a dental abscess. coronaviruses can survive on surfaces (inanimate objects) and can remain viable for 3–5 days, dependent on the surface type, worst being plastics. fortunately, the infectivity decreases with time. dental patients could have a strong urge to spit after a procedure. covid-19 has been found in infected saliva (to et al., 2020); patient spitting could enhance the spread of the covid-19 within the dental premises. the same precautions should apply for all patients regardless of case status (positive, carrier or negative) during the period of sustained covid-19 transmission. hand hygiene should be practised and extended to exposed forearms. it is important to carry out hand hygiene after each patient contact. the appropriate use of personal protective equipment (ppe) will protect the dentist and staff from contamination in most circumstances. the ppe to be used in dental practices should be in line with the national recommendations given by the government chief dental officer or the professional organisation to which the dentist may belong to. for undertaking any direct patient care, dentists and dental surgery assistants and other oral health professionals are advised to wear, disposable gloves, aprons, eye protection and face shields where there is a risk of saliva, blood, other body fluids, secretions or excretions splashing into the face and eyes. sessional use of some ppe, other than hand gloves, may be rational. challacombe, kirk-bayley, sunkaraneni, and combes (2020) propose the use of 10 ml of povidone iodine (pvp-i) 0.5% solution - an effective virucide- applied as a mouth rinse for all patients (in those without contraindications to its use eg. history of allergy to pvp, thyroid disease etc) requiring dental treatment during the current covid-19 pandemic, just prior to treatment. decontamination of equipment and the care environment must be performed after each patient and should be carried out as per practice protocols. decontamination of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in aerosols (liu et al., 2020). it is generally advisable to avoid the use of fans that re-circulate the air. all non-essential items including toys, books and magazines should be removed from reception and waiting areas. careful and thorough decontamination practice of laboratory items (e.g. impressions, prostheses) remains the responsibility of dental practices before any such items are dispatched to dental laboratories, in order to prevent all types of cross-infection. demographic data on the current covid-19 pandemic suggest that the disease incidence and observed fatality proportion of cases vary widely in different parts of the world. bacillus calmette–guérin (bcg) vaccination status has been implicated as providing some immune protection to vaccinated communities. bcg utilises a weakened strain of mycobacterium bovis to vaccinate against tuberculosis. many countries began bcg vaccination programmes in the 1940s, and in particular, the commonwealth countries have continued this public health practice to vaccinate babies at birth or at school entry. between 1980 and 2007 several countries have ceased their bcg vaccination campaigns notably in europe, spain, denmark austria, germany, the isle of man, slovenia, uk, finland and france, and some countries have not had a universal bcg vaccination policy, for example italy, usa, lebanon, the netherland and belgium. a global map (figure 1) displaying bcg vaccination policy by country has been published (zwerling et al., 2011; zwerling & pai, 2011). using european data, hegarty, sfakianos, giannarini, dinardo, and kamat (2020) and global data miller et al. (2020) have shown considerable overlap with the map of countries with and without a national programme of bcg vaccination and the incidence of covid-19 infection. they speculate that countries with bcg vaccination programmes have far fewer coronavirus cases (by a factor 10), compared to where bcg programmes are no longer deployed. for example, italy, where the covid-19 mortality is very high, never implemented universal bcg vaccination. portugal which had an effective bcg vaccination policy demonstrated a low incidence of covid-19 and fewer deaths, than neighbouring spain. bcg vaccination has shown to stimulate the innate immune system to develop “memory,” termed trained immunity, which helps to eliminate various non-mycobacterium infections including influenza (covián et al., 2019). in view of bcg vaccine's heterologous beneficial effect against non-tuberculosis infections (miller et al., 2020), the question has been raised “whether bcg may enhance one's immunity against covid-19.” there are two trials under way studying the effect of bcg vaccination to increase resistance to infections in the elderly population and to try and to help prevent severe covid-19 infection in healthcare workers: brace in australia (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04327206] and bcg-corona in the netherlands [https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct04328441). a lot of pharma companies are working on vaccines and the development of those vaccines are at various stages. on 23rd april, who announced that seven vaccines have now been approved for human testing through clinical trials (world health organization, 2020). of the seven, 3 are being tested in china, one in the uk, two in usa and one in germany. the university of oxford has taken the lead with a double-blind rct testing their chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine, which uses an adenovirus vaccine vector and the sars-cov-2 spike protein. the trial vaccine is being tested on close to 1,100 healthy volunteers and using a vaccine against meningococcus as a control. a timeframe for vaccine development of 12 to 18 month is needed but it is believed that an effective candidate may be announced sooner. equal distribution of the vaccine around the world would remain a challenge. as means of protecting dental staff and patients, triaging patients over the telephone or video systems, room ventilation, appropriate ppe, sanitization of protective apparel is recommended. proper use and disinfection of all areas of the practice including the toilets can effectively limit the concentration of sars-cov-2 rna in aerosols (liu et al., 2020). relatives or friends accompanying patients to a dental practice should be restricted to essential visitors only, such as parents of paediatric patients. at patient reception areas, distancing measures should be carried out—ensuring a distance of two metres is kept. dentists should keep up to date with and have regard to the latest advice from government, the health service and the chief medical (dental) officer. the position may change daily and therefore it is important to check that advice regularly. none."

(a) axial images from chest ct show left axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (arrows). (b) comparison chest ct images from 1 year prior show normal left axillary lymph nodes.download as powerpointopen in image viewer how common is vaccine-induced axillary lymphadenopathy?although unilateral lymphadenopathy is a known side effect of vaccines, it is rarely reported with vaccines such as the bacillus calmette–guérin, influenza, and human papillomavirus vaccines (3–5). in a larger series examining 83 recipients of the influenza vaccine, four patients had unexpected fluorodeoxyglucose axillary node accumulations on imaging (5). in addition, lymph node uptake on nuclear medicine studies after vaccination has been shown by multiple studies.this is in contrast with the two-dose approved covid-19 vaccines in the united states, pfizer-biontech and moderna, which both have higher reported rates of axillary swelling compared with prior vaccines. this may be due to a higher immunogenic response to these mrna vaccines, a type of vaccine that has not previously been approved for use. as a solicited adverse event in the moderna clinical trials, axillary swelling or tenderness was reported in 11.6% of patients (5.0% placebo) after dose 1 and 16.0% (4.3% placebo) after dose 2 (1). while not solicited as an adverse event in the pfizer trials, reports of lymphadenopathy from dose 1 through 30 days after dose 2 were imbalanced with notably more cases in the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine group (64) versus the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination (2). the true incidence of postvaccination lymphadenopathy may be higher given axillary swelling was only reported as an unsolicited adverse event. incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy visible at imaging is likely higher as not all patients have clinical symptoms.what has been reported in the literature so far regarding covid-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy?as of march 2021, at least 20 articles have been published illustrating or discussing covid-19 vaccine–related lymphadenopathy, with 18 of these articles published in imaging journals. the earliest publications occurred in the field of breast imaging, where vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy was cited as a cause of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. other imaging subspecialities citing this side effect included nine articles in nuclear medicine, and one article in cardiothoracic imaging. in most publications so far, there has only been one or a very small number of patients reported on; one of the largest groups of patients reported on is 23 patients with axillary adenopathy who had undergone breast imaging (6). journals which have published on this subject include radiology, american journal of roentgenology, european journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, clinical nuclear medicine, and journal of the american college of radiology (jacr). the majority of these articles reported lymphadenopathy as a side effect after the two-dose covid-19 pfizer or moderna vaccines with two recent articles citing vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy with the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine, currently only given as one dose in the united kingdom, with the second dose planned for delayed administration. the location of the lymphadenopathy was primarily axillary with four articles reporting cervical lymphadenopathy. the lymphadenopathy can be visualized on multiple modalities with most published cases demonstrated on us, followed by pet, mri, mammography, and ct.what are the current imaging guidelines related to vaccine-induced axillary lymphadenopathy?the society of breast imaging (sbi) was the first imaging society to propose guidelines addressing axillary lymphadenopathy seen on imaging (7), with the canadian society of breast imaging (csbi) endorsing the sbi recommendations. there have now been multiple publications suggesting guidelines for unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with focus on different modalities or oncologic subspecialities. we summarize these below divided in terms of different phases of care.clinical historyvaccination dates, injection site/laterality, and vaccine type should be documented on patient intake forms or electronic medical record (7).scheduling examinationsto mitigate the diagnostic dilemma of vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy, the sbi recommends that patients should “consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose of a covid-19 vaccination or 4-6 weeks following the second dose of a covid-19 vaccination” (7). this recommendation has been followed by a similar guideline published in radiology from a multidisciplinary panel from oncologic centers, recommending for nonurgent indications such as routine surveillance, screening, or staging imaging to be scheduled prior to vaccination or to postpone imaging “at least 6 weeks after final vaccination dose” (8). mcintosh et al also (9) suggested performing pet/ct “at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination.” however, like other imaging examinations, if there is an urgent clinical indication such as treatment planning, active treatment monitoring, or assessment of new symptoms or potential complications, imaging should not be delayed, regardless of vaccination status.an additional strategy to mitigate confounding findings would be to administer covid-19 vaccinations “on the side contralateral to the primary cancer” (8).incidentally detected unilateral lymphadenopathy on imagingfor subclinical unilateral lymphadenopathy detected on imaging, vaccination history including injection site and date is now a key piece of clinical information to obtain. in cases of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography, the sbi recommends a bi-rads 0 designation to bring the patient back for assessment of the ipsilateral breast and additional documentation of medical and vaccination history (7). after an otherwise negative diagnostic workup, and if a covid-19 vaccine was given on the ipsilateral side in the past 4 weeks, a bi-rads 3 (probably benign) assessment is then assigned with consideration for a short-term follow-up in 4–12 weeks after the second vaccination dose. if lymphadenopathy persists at follow-up, then consider a bi-rads 4 (suspicious) assessment with biopsy to exclude malignancy. as these recommendations were first announced in january 2021 based on very early experience with covid-19 vaccinations, they are necessarily meant to be conservative. in an update (march 9, 2021), the sbi notes that individual practices may wish to establish their own guidelines based on local expertise and resources.a different approach was suggested by a recent publication in jacr proposing use of “bi-rads 2 benign” assessment with clinical follow-up for isolated unilateral lymphadenopathy after recent covid-19 vaccination in the ipsilateral arm (10). this is consistent with the american college of radiology bi-rads recommendations for unilateral lymphadenopathy in the setting of a known inflammatory cause (10). in comparison with the more conservative sbi recommendations, this “pragmatic” approach would result in fewer follow-up examinations.in terms of management of clinically evident postvaccination lymphadenopathy, the multidisciplinary panel recommended “observing for at least 6 weeks until resolution before referring for diagnostic imaging evaluation or biopsy of the nodes” (8). the multidisciplinary panel also recommended “expectant management strategy without default follow-up imaging” in patients whom pretest probability of adenopathy is much more likely due to vaccination rather than malignancy. in higher-risk situations, either a short-term imaging follow-up with us and/or tissue diagnosis can be considered, especially in patients with a high-risk oncologic history (eg, ipsilateral breast or head/neck cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma) (8). the expected duration of postvaccination lymphadenopathy is not yet determined.what are the implications for patients?widespread patient education regarding vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy is needed, especially as this may be mistaken as a sign of malignancy. imaging societies, clinicians, and news media outlets should spread awareness to educate the public regarding this side effect to minimize patient anxiety. when vaccines are administered, side effects such as axillary swelling should be highlighted and normalized as an immune response initiated by the vaccine. patients should be aware of the best times to schedule routine imaging examinations with more infographics such as the sbi mammography recommendations for women receiving the covid-19 vaccine being widely distributed. in patients with palpable lymphadenopathy after vaccination, another suggestion may be to proceed with clinical follow-up by a clinician or the patient themselves rather than imaging, resulting in cost-savings to the system. care should also be taken to ensure clinical and/or imaging follow-up for those with lymphadenopathy that does not resolve, those with potentially causative malignancies (such as breast or head/neck cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma), and those with additional sites of lymphadenopathy.disclosures of conflicts of interest: w.t. activities related to

(a) axial images from chest ct show left axillary and subpectoral lymphadenopathy (arrows). (b) comparison chest ct images from 1 year prior show normal left axillary lymph nodes.download as powerpointopen in image viewer how common is vaccine-induced axillary lymphadenopathy?although unilateral lymphadenopathy is a known side effect of vaccines, it is rarely reported with vaccines such as the bacillus calmette–guérin, influenza, and human papillomavirus vaccines (3–5). in a larger series examining 83 recipients of the influenza vaccine, four patients had unexpected fluorodeoxyglucose axillary node accumulations on imaging (5). in addition, lymph node uptake on nuclear medicine studies after vaccination has been shown by multiple studies.this is in contrast with the two-dose approved covid-19 vaccines in the united states, pfizer-biontech and moderna, which both have higher reported rates of axillary swelling compared with prior vaccines. this may be due to a higher immunogenic response to these mrna vaccines, a type of vaccine that has not previously been approved for use. as a solicited adverse event in the moderna clinical trials, axillary swelling or tenderness was reported in 11.6% of patients (5.0% placebo) after dose 1 and 16.0% (4.3% placebo) after dose 2 (1). while not solicited as an adverse event in the pfizer trials, reports of lymphadenopathy from dose 1 through 30 days after dose 2 were imbalanced with notably more cases in the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine group (64) versus the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination (2). the true incidence of postvaccination lymphadenopathy may be higher given axillary swelling was only reported as an unsolicited adverse event. incidence of axillary lymphadenopathy visible at imaging is likely higher as not all patients have clinical symptoms.what has been reported in the literature so far regarding covid-19 vaccine-related lymphadenopathy?as of march 2021, at least 20 articles have been published illustrating or discussing covid-19 vaccine–related lymphadenopathy, with 18 of these articles published in imaging journals. the earliest publications occurred in the field of breast imaging, where vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy was cited as a cause of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. other imaging subspecialities citing this side effect included nine articles in nuclear medicine, and one article in cardiothoracic imaging. in most publications so far, there has only been one or a very small number of patients reported on; one of the largest groups of patients reported on is 23 patients with axillary adenopathy who had undergone breast imaging (6). journals which have published on this subject include radiology, american journal of roentgenology, european journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging, clinical nuclear medicine, and journal of the american college of radiology (jacr). the majority of these articles reported lymphadenopathy as a side effect after the two-dose covid-19 pfizer or moderna vaccines with two recent articles citing vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy with the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine, currently only given as one dose in the united kingdom, with the second dose planned for delayed administration. the location of the lymphadenopathy was primarily axillary with four articles reporting cervical lymphadenopathy. the lymphadenopathy can be visualized on multiple modalities with most published cases demonstrated on us, followed by pet, mri, mammography, and ct.what are the current imaging guidelines related to vaccine-induced axillary lymphadenopathy?the society of breast imaging (sbi) was the first imaging society to propose guidelines addressing axillary lymphadenopathy seen on imaging (7), with the canadian society of breast imaging (csbi) endorsing the sbi recommendations. there have now been multiple publications suggesting guidelines for unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy with focus on different modalities or oncologic subspecialities. we summarize these below divided in terms of different phases of care.clinical historyvaccination dates, injection site/laterality, and vaccine type should be documented on patient intake forms or electronic medical record (7).scheduling examinationsto mitigate the diagnostic dilemma of vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy, the sbi recommends that patients should “consider scheduling screening exams prior to the first dose of a covid-19 vaccination or 4-6 weeks following the second dose of a covid-19 vaccination” (7). this recommendation has been followed by a similar guideline published in radiology from a multidisciplinary panel from oncologic centers, recommending for nonurgent indications such as routine surveillance, screening, or staging imaging to be scheduled prior to vaccination or to postpone imaging “at least 6 weeks after final vaccination dose” (8). mcintosh et al also (9) suggested performing pet/ct “at least 2 weeks after vaccination in patients with a cancer for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though optimally 4-6 weeks after vaccination.” however, like other imaging examinations, if there is an urgent clinical indication such as treatment planning, active treatment monitoring, or assessment of new symptoms or potential complications, imaging should not be delayed, regardless of vaccination status.an additional strategy to mitigate confounding findings would be to administer covid-19 vaccinations “on the side contralateral to the primary cancer” (8).incidentally detected unilateral lymphadenopathy on imagingfor subclinical unilateral lymphadenopathy detected on imaging, vaccination history including injection site and date is now a key piece of clinical information to obtain. in cases of unilateral axillary lymphadenopathy on screening mammography, the sbi recommends a bi-rads 0 designation to bring the patient back for assessment of the ipsilateral breast and additional documentation of medical and vaccination history (7). after an otherwise negative diagnostic workup, and if a covid-19 vaccine was given on the ipsilateral side in the past 4 weeks, a bi-rads 3 (probably benign) assessment is then assigned with consideration for a short-term follow-up in 4–12 weeks after the second vaccination dose. if lymphadenopathy persists at follow-up, then consider a bi-rads 4 (suspicious) assessment with biopsy to exclude malignancy. as these recommendations were first announced in january 2021 based on very early experience with covid-19 vaccinations, they are necessarily meant to be conservative. in an update (march 9, 2021), the sbi notes that individual practices may wish to establish their own guidelines based on local expertise and resources.a different approach was suggested by a recent publication in jacr proposing use of “bi-rads 2 benign” assessment with clinical follow-up for isolated unilateral lymphadenopathy after recent covid-19 vaccination in the ipsilateral arm (10). this is consistent with the american college of radiology bi-rads recommendations for unilateral lymphadenopathy in the setting of a known inflammatory cause (10). in comparison with the more conservative sbi recommendations, this “pragmatic” approach would result in fewer follow-up examinations.in terms of management of clinically evident postvaccination lymphadenopathy, the multidisciplinary panel recommended “observing for at least 6 weeks until resolution before referring for diagnostic imaging evaluation or biopsy of the nodes” (8). the multidisciplinary panel also recommended “expectant management strategy without default follow-up imaging” in patients whom pretest probability of adenopathy is much more likely due to vaccination rather than malignancy. in higher-risk situations, either a short-term imaging follow-up with us and/or tissue diagnosis can be considered, especially in patients with a high-risk oncologic history (eg, ipsilateral breast or head/neck cancer, melanoma, or lymphoma) (8). the expected duration of postvaccination lymphadenopathy is not yet determined.what are the implications for patients?widespread patient education regarding vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy is needed, especially as this may be mistaken as a sign of malignancy. imaging societies, clinicians, and news media outlets should spread awareness to educate the public regarding this side effect to minimize patient anxiety. when vaccines are administered, side effects such as axillary swelling should be highlighted and normalized as an immune response initiated by the vaccine. patients should be aware of the best times to schedule routine imaging examinations with more infographics such as the sbi mammography recommendations for women receiving the covid-19 vaccine being widely distributed. in patients with palpable lymphadenopathy after vaccination, another suggestion may be to proceed with clinical follow-up by a clinician or the patient themselves rather than imaging, resulting in cost-savings to the system. care should also be taken to ensure clinical and/or imaging follow-up for those with lymphadenopathy that does not resolve, those with potentially causative malignancies (such as breast or head/neck cancer, lymphoma, or melanoma), and those with additional sites of lymphadenopathy.disclosures of conflicts of interest: w.t. activities related to

2020: ahead of print although hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, have been proposed for treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19),1 their potential cardiovascular toxicities had limited consideration in this new clinical environment. we aimed to determine whether these drugs were associated with an increased reporting of cardiovascular (cv) adverse drug reactions (adr) in a real-world population, before start of prescription for covid-19 in europe and america.in this observational, retrospective study, we used vigibase,2,3 the world health organization pharmacovigilance database encompassing more than 21 million reports from more than 130 countries, to compare cv-adr reporting in patients who received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or their combination with cv-adrs reported with all other drugs in the full database (clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04314817). association between hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination with cv-adr was assessed using reporting odds ratio (ror) and information component (ic), an indicator value for disproportionate bayesian reporting that compares observed and expected values to find associations between drugs and adr.2 the lower end of the ic’s 95% credibility interval is ic025. it is considered significant when above 0.2 reporting odds ratios were computed to compare adr frequencies between different exposures, using χ2 tests.3 these methods are similar to those used to study cv-adr related to anticancer and hormonal drugs.2,3 for each report, age, sex, time to onset (tto), fatalities, concurrent adrs, and medications (drugs associated with a known or possible risk of qt prolongation as reported at crediblemeds.org)4 were collected. tto were compared using nonparametric tests. the french national commission for data protection and liberties and institutional review board approved the use of confidential electronically processed patient data. all cv-adrs were included, classified by group queries,2 according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities, between november 14, 1967, and march 1, 2020.we extracted 76 822 adr cases associated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 89 692 with azithromycin alone, and 607 with the combination of both drugs. the cases were retrieved from 21 275 867 total adr reports in vigibase. hydroxychloroquine was a suspected (versus concomitantly used) drug in 21 808/76 822 (28.4%) cases and azithromycin in 54 533/89 692 (60.8%) cases.there was significant greater reporting of prolonged-qt (lqt) and/or ventricular tachycardia including torsades-de-pointes (tdp/vt) for each drug individually in suspected cases (n=480 [223 lqt; 257 tdp/vt], ic025=1.67 for azithromycin and n=136 [53 lqt; 83 tdp/vt], ic025=1.04 for hydroxychloroquine; figure). hydroxychloroquine was also associated with conduction disorders (atrioventricular and bundle-branch blocks; n=75, ic025=1.04) and heart failure (n=203, ic025=0.06). no other cv-adr (including cardiac ischemia and myocarditis)2 was significantly associated with these drugs. the ic values over time and intersecting cases for significant cv-adrs associated with hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin are presented in the figure.download figuredownload powerpointfigure. temporal evolution (last accessed march 1, 2020) of the

hydroxychloroquine and lqt and/or tdp/vt (n=90), for hydroxychloroquine and conduction disorders (n=77), for hydroxychloroquine and heart failure (n=94), and for azithromycin and lqt and/or tdp/vt (n=70). statistics:2 ic = log2[(nobserved + 0.5)/(nexpected + 0.5)], where nexpected = (ndrug × nreaction)/ntotal, with nexpected being the number of individual case safety reports (icsrs) expected for the drug-adr combination; nobserved being the actual number of icsrs observed for the drug-adr combination; ndrug being the number of icsrs for the drug, regardless of adr; nreaction being the number of icsrs for the adr, regardless of the drug; and ntotal being the total number of icsrs in the database.azithromycin monotherapy was associated with a greater reporting of lqt and/or tdp/vt than hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (736/89 085 [0.8%] versus 263/76 215 [0.3%], respectively; reporting odds ratio, 2.36 [95% ci, 2.05–2.71). the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater reporting of lqt and/or tdp/vt reporting than either drug in monotherapy (999/165 300 [0.6%] versus 9/607 [1.5%], reporting odds ratio, 2.48 [95% ci, 1.28–4.79]).most cv-adrs reports were in women (516/772, 66.8%). reporting regions were mostly americas (549/851, 64.5%) and europe (185/851, 21.7%). reporters were mostly healthcare professionals (674/706, 91.1%). in most cases, adr was attributed to a single drug (492/844, 58.3%). concurrent reporting of drugs with a known risk of tdp in tdp/vt cases was 31.5% (81/257) with azithromycin and 16.9% (14/83) with hydroxychloroquine.4tto of lqt and/or tdp/vt with azithromycin was shorter compared with hydroxychloroquine (3 [interquartile range=1;7] versus 51 [iqr=11;113] days, p<0.01). with hydroxychloroquine, tto of lqt and/or tdp/vt was shorter than heart failure (51 [iqr=11;113] versus 348 [iqr=91;2016] days, p=0.027). this longer tto observed in hydroxychloroquine may reflect chronic use in lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.the proportion that resulted in death for tdp/vt cases was 8.4% (7/83) with hydroxychloroquine and 20.2% (52/257) with azithromycin versus 0% (0/53) and 5.4% (12/223) for lqt without tdp/vt with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, respectively (p<0.001 for both). the corresponding death rate was 20.7% (42/203) for heart failure associated with hydroxychloroquine. the dose of hydroxychloroquine was higher in heart failure compared with lqt and/or tdp/vt cases (200 [iqr=200;400] versus 200 [iqr=200;200] mg/d, p=0.033).the main limitation is that without data on numbers exposed in vigibase, this work cannot assess the incidence or risk for qt prolongation with these drugs. however, our results are consistent with the facts that these cv-adrs are found in the us food and drug administration’s labels of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and that both drugs are referenced as having a known risk of tdp on the crediblemeds website.4 these cv-adrs are important to bear in mind in the setting of covid-19 with patients presenting additional risk factors of lqt/tdp caused by inflammation with elevated interleukin-6, hypokalemia, numerous interacting drugs, bradycardia, and higher hydroxychloroquine dosages.5in conclusion, reports of potentially lethal acute cardiac proarrhythmogenic effects leading to ventricular arrhythmias have been described mainly with azithromycin but also with hydroxychloroquine. their combination yielded an even stronger signal. hydroxychloroquine was also associated with potentially lethal heart failure when exposure was prolonged over several months.acknowledgmentsthe authors thank banook group/cardiabase, nancy–france http://www.banookgroup.com/ (yasmin khan) for providing the holter and ecg systems to evaluate prospectively the impact of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin on ventricular arrhythmia in a current cohort of treated patients with covid-19, as a follow-up study of this work. they also thank the staff of the ap.hp.sorbonne clinical investigation center (maria martin, francois gueguin, dr paul gougis, dr bruno pinna) for their involvement in the latter study and their current effort to better study adverse drug reactions associated with covid-19 drugs.disclosuresthe supplied data from vigibase come from various sources. the likelihood of a causal relationship is not the same in all

articleyou are viewing the most recent version of this article. previous versions: may 22, 2020: ahead of print although hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, alone or in combination, have been proposed for treatment of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19),1 their potential cardiovascular toxicities had limited consideration in this new clinical environment. we aimed to determine whether these drugs were associated with an increased reporting of cardiovascular (cv) adverse drug reactions (adr) in a real-world population, before start of prescription for covid-19 in europe and america.in this observational, retrospective study, we used vigibase,2,3 the world health organization pharmacovigilance database encompassing more than 21 million reports from more than 130 countries, to compare cv-adr reporting in patients who received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or their combination with cv-adrs reported with all other drugs in the full database (clinicaltrials.gov identifier nct04314817). association between hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and their combination with cv-adr was assessed using reporting odds ratio (ror) and information component (ic), an indicator value for disproportionate bayesian reporting that compares observed and expected values to find associations between drugs and adr.2 the lower end of the ic’s 95% credibility interval is ic025. it is considered significant when above 0.2 reporting odds ratios were computed to compare adr frequencies between different exposures, using χ2 tests.3 these methods are similar to those used to study cv-adr related to anticancer and hormonal drugs.2,3 for each report, age, sex, time to onset (tto), fatalities, concurrent adrs, and medications (drugs associated with a known or possible risk of qt prolongation as reported at crediblemeds.org)4 were collected. tto were compared using nonparametric tests. the french national commission for data protection and liberties and institutional review board approved the use of confidential electronically processed patient data. all cv-adrs were included, classified by group queries,2 according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities, between november 14, 1967, and march 1, 2020.we extracted 76 822 adr cases associated with hydroxychloroquine alone, 89 692 with azithromycin alone, and 607 with the combination of both drugs. the cases were retrieved from 21 275 867 total adr reports in vigibase. hydroxychloroquine was a suspected (versus concomitantly used) drug in 21 808/76 822 (28.4%) cases and azithromycin in 54 533/89 692 (60.8%) cases.there was significant greater reporting of prolonged-qt (lqt) and/or ventricular tachycardia including torsades-de-pointes (tdp/vt) for each drug individually in suspected cases (n=480 [223 lqt; 257 tdp/vt], ic025=1.67 for azithromycin and n=136 [53 lqt; 83 tdp/vt], ic025=1.04 for hydroxychloroquine; figure). hydroxychloroquine was also associated with conduction disorders (atrioventricular and bundle-branch blocks; n=75, ic025=1.04) and heart failure (n=203, ic025=0.06). no other cv-adr (including cardiac ischemia and myocarditis)2 was significantly associated with these drugs. the ic values over time and intersecting cases for significant cv-adrs associated with hydroxychloroquine or azithromycin are presented in the

24/75 (32%) were bundle-branch blocks, and 1/75 (1%) was a sinus block. time to onset data are available for hydroxychloroquine and lqt and/or tdp/vt (n=90), for hydroxychloroquine and conduction disorders (n=77), for hydroxychloroquine and heart failure (n=94), and for azithromycin and lqt and/or tdp/vt (n=70). statistics:2 ic = log2[(nobserved + 0.5)/(nexpected + 0.5)], where nexpected = (ndrug × nreaction)/ntotal, with nexpected being the number of individual case safety reports (icsrs) expected for the drug-adr combination; nobserved being the actual number of icsrs observed for the drug-adr combination; ndrug being the number of icsrs for the drug, regardless of adr; nreaction being the number of icsrs for the adr, regardless of the drug; and ntotal being the total number of icsrs in the database.azithromycin monotherapy was associated with a greater reporting of lqt and/or tdp/vt than hydroxychloroquine monotherapy (736/89 085 [0.8%] versus 263/76 215 [0.3%], respectively; reporting odds ratio, 2.36 [95% ci, 2.05–2.71). the combination of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine was associated with a greater reporting of lqt and/or tdp/vt reporting than either drug in monotherapy (999/165 300 [0.6%] versus 9/607 [1.5%], reporting odds ratio, 2.48 [95% ci, 1.28–4.79]).most cv-adrs reports were in women (516/772, 66.8%). reporting regions were mostly americas (549/851, 64.5%) and europe (185/851, 21.7%). reporters were mostly healthcare professionals (674/706, 91.1%). in most cases, adr was attributed to a single drug (492/844, 58.3%). concurrent reporting of drugs with a known risk of tdp in tdp/vt cases was 31.5% (81/257) with azithromycin and 16.9% (14/83) with hydroxychloroquine.4tto of lqt and/or tdp/vt with azithromycin was shorter compared with hydroxychloroquine (3 [interquartile range=1;7] versus 51 [iqr=11;113] days, p<0.01). with hydroxychloroquine, tto of lqt and/or tdp/vt was shorter than heart failure (51 [iqr=11;113] versus 348 [iqr=91;2016] days, p=0.027). this longer tto observed in hydroxychloroquine may reflect chronic use in lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.the proportion that resulted in death for tdp/vt cases was 8.4% (7/83) with hydroxychloroquine and 20.2% (52/257) with azithromycin versus 0% (0/53) and 5.4% (12/223) for lqt without tdp/vt with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, respectively (p<0.001 for both). the corresponding death rate was 20.7% (42/203) for heart failure associated with hydroxychloroquine. the dose of hydroxychloroquine was higher in heart failure compared with lqt and/or tdp/vt cases (200 [iqr=200;400] versus 200 [iqr=200;200] mg/d, p=0.033).the main limitation is that without data on numbers exposed in vigibase, this work cannot assess the incidence or risk for qt prolongation with these drugs. however, our results are consistent with the facts that these cv-adrs are found in the us food and drug administration’s labels of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, and that both drugs are referenced as having a known risk of tdp on the crediblemeds website.4 these cv-adrs are important to bear in mind in the setting of covid-19 with patients presenting additional risk factors of lqt/tdp caused by inflammation with elevated interleukin-6, hypokalemia, numerous interacting drugs, bradycardia, and higher hydroxychloroquine dosages.5in conclusion, reports of potentially lethal acute cardiac proarrhythmogenic effects leading to ventricular arrhythmias have been described mainly with azithromycin but also with hydroxychloroquine. their combination yielded an even stronger signal. hydroxychloroquine was also associated with potentially lethal heart failure when exposure was prolonged over several months.acknowledgmentsthe authors thank banook group/cardiabase,

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptorbcg vaccinecoronaviruscovid-19cytokine stormlymphocytopeniamycobacterium tuberculosispathogenesis of sars-cov-2sars-cov-2tuberculosisthe world is facing a major challenge of the new pneumonia condition termed covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2, the seventh member of human coronaviruses. the global burden of covid-19 is rising daily and as of 10 november 2020, there were over 1,275,122 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded rna viruses [1]. based on 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with a bat-borne coronavirus (batcov ratg13) that has been identified in rhinolophus affinis bat species, it is likely that sars-cov-2 originated from a bat [2]. covid-19 is primarily defined by an acute viral pneumonia and cytokine storm leading to respiratory failure [3]. the main transmission route of this virus is droplets blown out through cough and sneezing by an infected person. the common symptoms of covid-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath and tiredness [4]. severe cases manifest in symptoms that are associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia, multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock [5]. sars-cov-2 is highly pathogenic in persons with underlying medical conditions that reduce their immune competence such as tb [6].tb, caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis and transmitted through infected air droplets from cough or sneezing, is one of the top ten causes of death due to infectious diseases globally, with an estimated 10 million infections and 1.5 million deaths in 2018 [7]. indeed, since tb affects the respiratory system, it could prove catastrophic if present in comorbidity with covid-19 [6].in this commentary, we discuss the current state of knowledge on the parallels in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis and the potential implications of co-infection on the clinical outcomes.sars-cov-2 & m. tuberculosis: targeting same cells?spike (s) glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells. the s protein consists of three receptor-binding s1 heads which bind to the cellular receptor to facilitate viral attachment to target cells [8]. moreover, the s protein is required to be proteolytically active by being cleaved at the multibasic s1/s2 cleavage site by the host’s cell protease furin to facilitate protein-mediated cell-cell fusion [9]. the receptor binding domain of the s protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor and invade the host cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [4]. type i interferons (ifn) stimulate the expression of sars-cov-2 entry receptors and enable the virus to be endocytosed [4]. the high human ace2 binding affinity of the receptor binding domain and furin activation of the spike helps sars-cov-2 to successfully enter the human lung cell while evading the immune response [10]. the virus infects and replicates in ciliated and mucus-secreting cells of bronchial epithelium, type ii pneumocytes in the lungs [11] and macrophages [12].like sars-cov-2, m. tuberculosis also infects type ii pneumocytes in the lungs [13,14] via pattern recognition receptors of the host cells, including toll-like receptors, complement receptors, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign), mannose receptors, cd14 receptors, scavenger receptors and fcγ receptors [15]. furthermore, the bacterium is internalized through phagocytosis by the resident macrophages and further translocated to lysosomes for destruction [16].co-infection of sars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis may exacerbate the pathologies that are associated with each pathogen. the co-infection in macrophages can increase the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and therefore play a crucial role in pathogenesis. severe infection of type ii pneumocytes with sars-cov-2 can cause regeneration failure of the cells and lead to lesions in the lungs, accelerated bronchial damage and ultimately lung disease [17].dysregulating the immune system: the shared story of sars-cov-2 & m. tuberculosisthe human immune system responds to sars-cov-2 by differentiating the monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages through activation of jak–stat pathways, an activation that is mediated by production of il-1β and/ or il-18 [18]. the activation can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulting in covid-19-associated cytokine storm. cytokine storm causes rapid replication of sars-cov-2 virus and results in the infection of more alveolar epithelial cells [19]. significant elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6, il-1β and ip10 have been detected in covid-19 patients [20]. the rapidly increasing cytokines induce excess production of neutrophils, which infiltrate lung tissue and cause lung injury [21]. cytokine storm is also induced in m. tuberculosis infection and is driven by an overwhelming immune response from alveolar macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells in the lungs and lymph nodes [22]. these cells release an array of cytokines, including il-1, il-18, ifn-α, il-6, il-10 [23] and therefore co-infections of sars-cov-2 with m. tuberculosis will likely result in the production of high amounts of cytokines and lead to exacerbated pathogenicity.although the two pathogens share some features of cytokine storm, it is important to note that the magnitude of response differs, with m. tuberculosis having a lower response. moreover, the outcomes associated with cytokine storm are different for the two pathogens. the covid-19 patients experience acute respiratory distress syndrome whereas in m. tuberculosis chronic wasting and slow long destruction ensue from cytokine storm.another marked feature in the immune response against sars-cov-2 is lymphocytopenia [24]. lymphocytes count of less than 1.5 × 109 per liter has been shown to increase the risk of severe covid-19 [25]. it is believed that the virus directly infects lymphocytes through the ace2 receptor and kill them leading to lymphocytopenia [26]. the direct damage of organs such as the lymphatic system by sars-cov-2 may also result in a reduction of lymphocytes. production of tnfα, il-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines during sars-cov-2 can also induce lymphocyte apoptosis [26].the dysregulation of t lymphocytes has also been demonstrated in tb patients [27]. it has been reported that protective immunity to tb depends on cd4+ cells through cell-mediated responses to allow control of m. tuberculosis infection [28]. a depletion of the cd4+ cells increases risks to reactivation of tb [29], and is also associated with severe radiological lesions, increased paradoxical reaction or death [27,30]. the depletion of cd4+ by tb may also result in immunosuppression, which may increase severity on patients with comorbidity of tb and sars-cov-2 [31].potential protective effects of bcg vaccine against covid-19bcg is a live attenuated vaccine that has been used to protect children against tb and other viral infections [32]. the vaccine induces immune response through production of antibodies that prevent the proliferation of the pathogen [33]. it is suggested that bcg vaccine might boost the immune system and help reduce the severity of covid-19 [34]. bcg vaccination has a nonspecific or heterologous effect, which reduces morbidity and mortality to subsequent infections [35]. the vaccine activates cd4+ and cd8+ memory cells with nontargeted antigens, thus modulating t helper (th) 1 and th17 responses for secondary infections [36]. bcg also induces immunological memory in innate immune cells including natural killer (nk) cells, monocytes and macrophages [37]. all these result in bystander response including enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf and il-6, macrophage activity, t-cell responses and enhanced antibody titers [35].based on the nonspecific nature of bcg and its capacity to elicit both innate and adaptive immunity, bcg vaccine has been suggested as a preventive measure against sars-cov-2 infection or to reduce covid-19 severity, especially among children who have already been vaccinated with bcg [38,39]. healthy individuals vaccinated with bcg will have a boosted immune system, which upon infection with sars-cov-2, will lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and consequently less inflammation and reduced possibility of cytokine storm production and lymphopenia [38]. countries in africa, asia and south america, that are implementing mandatory national bcg vaccination for their populations, have demonstrated lower covid-19 cases and mortality [39,40]. although, a direct link between the low covid-19 cases and bcg is yet to be established, it is probable that bcg vaccination induces protection against sars-cov-2 via trained innate immunity. bcg vaccination results in epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or nk cells, which robustly responds to and clears a broad spectrum of viruses, including sars-cov-2 [41]. more scientific evidence is needed to establish the protective nature of bcg to sars-cov-2 specifically, and to which group of individuals – children and/or adults – should be targeted to realize the full benefits of this trained immunity. moreover, considering that heightened immune response such as cytokine response is attributed to complications in covid-19 patients [42], the potential negative effects of elevated immune response by the bcg’s trained immunity warrants further investigation.conclusion & future perspectivesars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis infections have some important parallels with regards to cell entry, immune response and immune evasion. thus, tb-endemic regions may have exacerbated pathologies in the context of sars-cov-2 infections; something that the scientific community will need to pay attention to. at the moment, recommending bcg vaccine for combating covid-19 must be done with caution. moreover, the vaccine does not offer a lifetime protection and there is paucity of evidence confirming its protective role against sars-cov-2. more research should be directed toward a deeper understanding of how bcg might protect against covid-19. a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of covid-19 in the context of m. tuberculosis co-infection is warranted to inform on better ways to manage such cases and avert high

angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptorbcg vaccinecoronaviruscovid-19cytokine stormlymphocytopeniamycobacterium tuberculosispathogenesis of sars-cov-2sars-cov-2tuberculosisthe world is facing a major challenge of the new pneumonia condition termed covid-19 caused by sars-cov-2, the seventh member of human coronaviruses. the global burden of covid-19 is rising daily and as of 10 november 2020, there were over 1,275,122 deaths (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/).coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-sense and single-stranded rna viruses [1]. based on 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with a bat-borne coronavirus (batcov ratg13) that has been identified in rhinolophus affinis bat species, it is likely that sars-cov-2 originated from a bat [2]. covid-19 is primarily defined by an acute viral pneumonia and cytokine storm leading to respiratory failure [3]. the main transmission route of this virus is droplets blown out through cough and sneezing by an infected person. the common symptoms of covid-19 include cough, fever, shortness of breath and tiredness [4]. severe cases manifest in symptoms that are associated with cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, myocardia, multiple organ dysfunction and septic shock [5]. sars-cov-2 is highly pathogenic in persons with underlying medical conditions that reduce their immune competence such as tb [6].tb, caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis and transmitted through infected air droplets from cough or sneezing, is one of the top ten causes of death due to infectious diseases globally, with an estimated 10 million infections and 1.5 million deaths in 2018 [7]. indeed, since tb affects the respiratory system, it could prove catastrophic if present in comorbidity with covid-19 [6].in this commentary, we discuss the current state of knowledge on the parallels in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis and the potential implications of co-infection on the clinical outcomes.sars-cov-2 & m. tuberculosis: targeting same cells?spike (s) glycoprotein on the surface of sars-cov-2 facilitates viral entry into target cells. the s protein consists of three receptor-binding s1 heads which bind to the cellular receptor to facilitate viral attachment to target cells [8]. moreover, the s protein is required to be proteolytically active by being cleaved at the multibasic s1/s2 cleavage site by the host’s cell protease furin to facilitate protein-mediated cell-cell fusion [9]. the receptor binding domain of the s protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ace2) receptor and invade the host cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis [4]. type i interferons (ifn) stimulate the expression of sars-cov-2 entry receptors and enable the virus to be endocytosed [4]. the high human ace2 binding affinity of the receptor binding domain and furin activation of the spike helps sars-cov-2 to successfully enter the human lung cell while evading the immune response [10]. the virus infects and replicates in ciliated and mucus-secreting cells of bronchial epithelium, type ii pneumocytes in the lungs [11] and macrophages [12].like sars-cov-2, m. tuberculosis also infects type ii pneumocytes in the lungs [13,14] via pattern recognition receptors of the host cells, including toll-like receptors, complement receptors, dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule grabbing nonintegrin (dc-sign), mannose receptors, cd14 receptors, scavenger receptors and fcγ receptors [15]. furthermore, the bacterium is internalized through phagocytosis by the resident macrophages and further translocated to lysosomes for destruction [16].co-infection of sars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis may exacerbate the pathologies that are associated with each pathogen. the co-infection in macrophages can increase the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and therefore play a crucial role in pathogenesis. severe infection of type ii pneumocytes with sars-cov-2 can cause regeneration failure of the cells and lead to lesions in the lungs, accelerated bronchial damage and ultimately lung disease [17].dysregulating the immune system: the shared story of sars-cov-2 & m. tuberculosisthe human immune system responds to sars-cov-2 by differentiating the monocytes into pro-inflammatory macrophages through activation of jak–stat pathways, an activation that is mediated by production of il-1β and/ or il-18 [18]. the activation can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and resulting in covid-19-associated cytokine storm. cytokine storm causes rapid replication of sars-cov-2 virus and results in the infection of more alveolar epithelial cells [19]. significant elevation of inflammatory cytokines such as il-6, il-1β and ip10 have been detected in covid-19 patients [20]. the rapidly increasing cytokines induce excess production of neutrophils, which infiltrate lung tissue and cause lung injury [21]. cytokine storm is also induced in m. tuberculosis infection and is driven by an overwhelming immune response from alveolar macrophages, monocytes and dendritic cells in the lungs and lymph nodes [22]. these cells release an array of cytokines, including il-1, il-18, ifn-α, il-6, il-10 [23] and therefore co-infections of sars-cov-2 with m. tuberculosis will likely result in the production of high amounts of cytokines and lead to exacerbated pathogenicity.although the two pathogens share some features of cytokine storm, it is important to note that the magnitude of response differs, with m. tuberculosis having a lower response. moreover, the outcomes associated with cytokine storm are different for the two pathogens. the covid-19 patients experience acute respiratory distress syndrome whereas in m. tuberculosis chronic wasting and slow long destruction ensue from cytokine storm.another marked feature in the immune response against sars-cov-2 is lymphocytopenia [24]. lymphocytes count of less than 1.5 × 109 per liter has been shown to increase the risk of severe covid-19 [25]. it is believed that the virus directly infects lymphocytes through the ace2 receptor and kill them leading to lymphocytopenia [26]. the direct damage of organs such as the lymphatic system by sars-cov-2 may also result in a reduction of lymphocytes. production of tnfα, il-6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines during sars-cov-2 can also induce lymphocyte apoptosis [26].the dysregulation of t lymphocytes has also been demonstrated in tb patients [27]. it has been reported that protective immunity to tb depends on cd4+ cells through cell-mediated responses to allow control of m. tuberculosis infection [28]. a depletion of the cd4+ cells increases risks to reactivation of tb [29], and is also associated with severe radiological lesions, increased paradoxical reaction or death [27,30]. the depletion of cd4+ by tb may also result in immunosuppression, which may increase severity on patients with comorbidity of tb and sars-cov-2 [31].potential protective effects of bcg vaccine against covid-19bcg is a live attenuated vaccine that has been used to protect children against tb and other viral infections [32]. the vaccine induces immune response through production of antibodies that prevent the proliferation of the pathogen [33]. it is suggested that bcg vaccine might boost the immune system and help reduce the severity of covid-19 [34]. bcg vaccination has a nonspecific or heterologous effect, which reduces morbidity and mortality to subsequent infections [35]. the vaccine activates cd4+ and cd8+ memory cells with nontargeted antigens, thus modulating t helper (th) 1 and th17 responses for secondary infections [36]. bcg also induces immunological memory in innate immune cells including natural killer (nk) cells, monocytes and macrophages [37]. all these result in bystander response including enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, ifn-γ, tnf and il-6, macrophage activity, t-cell responses and enhanced antibody titers [35].based on the nonspecific nature of bcg and its capacity to elicit both innate and adaptive immunity, bcg vaccine has been suggested as a preventive measure against sars-cov-2 infection or to reduce covid-19 severity, especially among children who have already been vaccinated with bcg [38,39]. healthy individuals vaccinated with bcg will have a boosted immune system, which upon infection with sars-cov-2, will lead to inhibited viral replication, decreased viral loads and consequently less inflammation and reduced possibility of cytokine storm production and lymphopenia [38]. countries in africa, asia and south america, that are implementing mandatory national bcg vaccination for their populations, have demonstrated lower covid-19 cases and mortality [39,40]. although, a direct link between the low covid-19 cases and bcg is yet to be established, it is probable that bcg vaccination induces protection against sars-cov-2 via trained innate immunity. bcg vaccination results in epigenetically trained populations of monocytes and/or nk cells, which robustly responds to and clears a broad spectrum of viruses, including sars-cov-2 [41]. more scientific evidence is needed to establish the protective nature of bcg to sars-cov-2 specifically, and to which group of individuals – children and/or adults – should be targeted to realize the full benefits of this trained immunity. moreover, considering that heightened immune response such as cytokine response is attributed to complications in covid-19 patients [42], the potential negative effects of elevated immune response by the bcg’s trained immunity warrants further investigation.conclusion & future perspectivesars-cov-2 and m. tuberculosis infections have some important parallels with regards to cell entry, immune response and immune evasion. thus, tb-endemic regions may have exacerbated pathologies in the context of sars-cov-2 infections; something that the scientific community will need to pay attention to. at the moment, recommending bcg vaccine for combating covid-19 must be done with caution. moreover, the vaccine does not offer a lifetime protection and there is paucity of evidence confirming its protective role against sars-cov-2. more research should be directed toward a deeper understanding of how bcg might protect against covid-19. a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of covid-19 in the context of m. tuberculosis co-infection is warranted to inform on better ways to manage such cases and avert high covid-19-related mortalities that are likely to occur in the high tb endemic areas.financial & competing interests disclosurek tapela and co olwal were supported by a waccbip-world bank ace phd

citationspermissionsreprints shareshare onfacebooktwitterlinkedinredditemail the turn of the decade will be remembered for the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) that has spread throughout the globe. while the fight to contain the virus continues, the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems around the world is becoming apparent. of particular concern to urologists are data from early stages of the pandemic showing sars-cov-2 infection rates of 3% in postoperative patients undergoing urological procedures in the republic of ireland between 16 march 2020 and 1 may 2020 [1]. hospitals have attempted to mitigate risk and conserve personal protective equipment (ppe) supplies by indefinitely postponing elective and nonessential surgery. of the procedures unable to be delayed, the question of which surgical approach minimises risk to the patient and team: laparoscopic or open, is particularly topical.when compared with open surgery, there are concerns that laparoscopic surgery confers a higher risk from an infection control perspective, of particular importance during the covid-19 pandemic. this concern arises from the increased aerosolisation risk associated with desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum and exposure to surgical plumes, particularly with the use of ultrasonic scalpels and electrical surgical devices [2]. desufflation causes a surgical plume to be created, which is a source of biological contamination containing blood cells, cell debris and potential viruses. this became particularly topical during the hiv epidemic, despite the fact hiv has never been isolated from a surgical plume. recommendations asserted that surgical teams should exercise caution and use appropriate precautions to avoid all contact with all tissues and bodily fluid [2–4]. this notion has been echoed by yu et al. when managing pneumoperitoneum in patients with or suspected of sars-cov-2 infection [1,5,6]. to date, there are no reports on sars-cov-2 aerosolisation by ablation, although co2 circulating in the pneumoperitoneum may generate aerosols that contain sars-cov-2 virus [4]. this is particularly relevant when desufflating in the absence of an appropriate capture device. indeed, the concerns regarding the increased risk of laparoscopic surgery led the royal college of surgeons of edinburgh (scotland) to recommend in their 27 march 2020 guidance to: “consider laparoscopy only in selected individual cases where clinical benefit to the patient substantially exceeds the risk of potential viral transmission in that particular situation. where nonoperative management is possible (such as for early appendicitis and acute cholecystitis) this should be implemented” [5].applying this advice to urological procedures being undertaken during this pandemic is not straightforward. table 1 highlights the conflicting guidelines and advice on managing urological laparoscopic surgery during the covid-19 pandemic that have been published to date. advances in both robotic, laparoscopic and laproendoscopic procedures has seen a significant reduction in the number of open surgeries being routinely performed by urologists. in particular, advances in ports used in transperineal and extraperitoneal robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy have led to a more stable pneumocavity and create a protective gas barrier within the ports themselves [7]. as discussed by horstmann et al. who compared the airseal® system valve-less trocar systems with standard versaport™ plus v2 trocar system in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy [7]. this brings into question the relevance of the concerns regarding desufflations increased aerosolisation risk, particularly in robotic surgery. moreover, robotic surgery allows staff to be more remote from the patient and each other when compared with laparoscopic and open operations, facilitating better social distancing within the operating room [8]. additionally, when compared with open procedures, laparoscopic approaches also generally allow improved social distancing between staff.table 1. summary of recommendations for urological minimally invasive surgeries during the covid-19 pandemic.studyjournal/guidelinerecommendations re lap surg in

risk of virus transmission[16]moschovas et al.eu focuspatients with a renal tumor ≥4 cm, demonstrate stage progression, growth kinetics >5 mm/yr or deterioration of their clinical condition should be considered for surgery if possible. patients with bleeding tumors with a hemodynamic impact, tumors with renal vein and vena cava thrombus or large tumors causing compression of adjacent organs may be considered as surgical candidates during this covid-19 period[17]articles were identified via a pubmed search, yielding 13 results. four papers were excluded as they did not provide recommendations on how to approach urological surgeries amid the pandemic.covid-19: coronavirus disease 2019; erus: eau robotic urology section; mis: minimally invasive surgery; ot: operating theatre; pca: prostate cancer; ppe: personal protective equipment; rcs: royal college of surgeon; sages: society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeon; turp: transurethral resection of the prostate.we are still interrogating the safest ways to approach surgery in the covid-19-era but there are certain aspects of the growing literature that have become clear. there is no evidence to confirm direct infection of members of a theatre team with the sars-cov-2 virus, or other viruses, from laparoscopic or open approach. nevertheless, the ability of the sars-cov-2 virus to survive in certain environments has also been established. it remains viable in aerosols for 3 h with a half-life of 1.1–1.2 h [18]. it can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h (half-life 5.6–6.8 h) [18]. as these materials are common within operating rooms, it is important to ensure adequate sterilization occurs both before and after surgical cases. there is also good evidence that contamination of said materials within an operating room can be contained by a negative pressure environment [19].there are also questions when it comes to the fidelity of testing, with lippi et al. documenting the limitations of the current reverse transcriptase (rt-pcr) method [20] . the rt-pcr test being used to confirm covid-19 infections was shown to have a significantly high false negative rate of up to 30% with reliability depending on the pre-analytical handling of samples, selection of primers and quality of reagents and equipment [20]. lippi et al. also asserts the limits of detection for the rt-pcr prevents the detection of positive patients with a low viral load, either in the initial phase of infection or following symptom relief [20]. as such, it is important to not be falsely reassured by a negative result. sars-cov-2 has been identified by wang et al. in clinical specimens other than respiratory samples, including feces from 29% of patients, and in blood from a small number of patients. importantly, for urologists, the virus has not been isolated in urine to date [21]. this is pertinent when urologists are considering natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, specifically a transrectal hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy, which uses the rectum to gain access to the peritoneal cavity rather than the abdominal wall [22]. despite being used infrequently, this approach to nephrectomy would lead to potential contamination of the access port and surgical field with sars-cov-2 in addition to colonic bacterial flora, potentially exposing the surgical team at increased risk of infection.while concern regarding the covid-19 pandemic remains ever present, it is important to understand the current gaps within the literature. an example of this ambiguity is the proposed utility in using bacillus calmette guérin (bcg) vaccine to improve sars-cov-2 morbidity and mortality. recent studies have shown countries without a recent or current universal bcg vaccination policy observed a slightly higher sars-cov-2 related morbidity and mortality than those countries that did [23]. this remains hypothetical at this stage without clear evidence. at present the most significant concern for urologists during this pandemic is to safely mitigate the risk of sars-cov-2 infection of both patient and the surgical team by considering the immediate need of a particular procedure, the approach and indeed even ports used to access the abdomen along with managing the surgical plume and having appropriate ppe and adjusting their planning accordingly.we are learning more about covid-19 daily, and as we look toward resumption of elective operating in australia, it is important to consider which surgical procedures remain safest for both the patient and the surgical team alike. the absence of sars-cov-2 in urine provides urologists with some degree of reassurance when performing endoscopic work. however, when weighing the risk and benefits of an open, laparoscopic or robotic procedures, it remains a difficult decision. the theoretical risk of increased transmission posed by laparoscopic surgery needs to be considered. nevertheless, the benefits of a minimally invasive surgical approach are long established, and these theoretical risks remain just that – theoretical. the increase in length of stay, in a high risk hospital environment after open surgery should also not be understated to a patient’s overall risk of infection [8]. we do know delaying a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer for ≤12 months with no androgen deprivation therapy for all categories of localized prostate cancer is not associated with adverse postoperative outcomes [24]. this provides patients reassurance and allows urologists the opportunity to ensure appropriate time and caution is taken to protect both staff and patients during this pandemic.financial & competing interests disclosurethe

decade will be remembered for the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2) that has spread throughout the globe. while the fight to contain the virus continues, the impact of the pandemic on healthcare systems around the world is becoming apparent. of particular concern to urologists are data from early stages of the pandemic showing sars-cov-2 infection rates of 3% in postoperative patients undergoing urological procedures in the republic of ireland between 16 march 2020 and 1 may 2020 [1]. hospitals have attempted to mitigate risk and conserve personal protective equipment (ppe) supplies by indefinitely postponing elective and nonessential surgery. of the procedures unable to be delayed, the question of which surgical approach minimises risk to the patient and team: laparoscopic or open, is particularly topical.when compared with open surgery, there are concerns that laparoscopic surgery confers a higher risk from an infection control perspective, of particular importance during the covid-19 pandemic. this concern arises from the increased aerosolisation risk associated with desufflation of the pneumoperitoneum and exposure to surgical plumes, particularly with the use of ultrasonic scalpels and electrical surgical devices [2]. desufflation causes a surgical plume to be created, which is a source of biological contamination containing blood cells, cell debris and potential viruses. this became particularly topical during the hiv epidemic, despite the fact hiv has never been isolated from a surgical plume. recommendations asserted that surgical teams should exercise caution and use appropriate precautions to avoid all contact with all tissues and bodily fluid [2–4]. this notion has been echoed by yu et al. when managing pneumoperitoneum in patients with or suspected of sars-cov-2 infection [1,5,6]. to date, there are no reports on sars-cov-2 aerosolisation by ablation, although co2 circulating in the pneumoperitoneum may generate aerosols that contain sars-cov-2 virus [4]. this is particularly relevant when desufflating in the absence of an appropriate capture device. indeed, the concerns regarding the increased risk of laparoscopic surgery led the royal college of surgeons of edinburgh (scotland) to recommend in their 27 march 2020 guidance to: “consider laparoscopy only in selected individual cases where clinical benefit to the patient substantially exceeds the risk of potential viral transmission in that particular situation. where nonoperative management is possible (such as for early appendicitis and acute cholecystitis) this should be implemented” [5].applying this advice to urological procedures being undertaken during this pandemic is not straightforward. table 1 highlights the conflicting guidelines and advice on managing urological laparoscopic surgery during the covid-19 pandemic that have been published to date. advances in both robotic, laparoscopic and laproendoscopic procedures has seen a significant reduction in the number of open surgeries being routinely performed by urologists. in particular, advances in ports used in transperineal and extraperitoneal robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy have led to a more stable pneumocavity and create a protective gas barrier within the ports themselves [7]. as discussed by horstmann et al. who compared the airseal® system valve-less trocar systems with standard versaport™ plus v2 trocar system in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy [7]. this brings into question the relevance of the concerns regarding desufflations increased aerosolisation risk, particularly in robotic surgery. moreover, robotic surgery allows staff to be more remote from the patient and each other when compared with laparoscopic and open operations, facilitating better social distancing within the operating room [8]. additionally, when compared with open procedures, laparoscopic approaches also generally allow improved social distancing between staff.table 1. summary of recommendations for urological minimally invasive surgeries during the covid-19

invasive surgery; ot: operating theatre; pca: prostate cancer; ppe: personal protective equipment; rcs: royal college of surgeon; sages: society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeon; turp: transurethral resection of the prostate.we are still interrogating the safest ways to approach surgery in the covid-19-era but there are certain aspects of the growing literature that have become clear. there is no evidence to confirm direct infection of members of a theatre team with the sars-cov-2 virus, or other viruses, from laparoscopic or open approach. nevertheless, the ability of the sars-cov-2 virus to survive in certain environments has also been established. it remains viable in aerosols for 3 h with a half-life of 1.1–1.2 h [18]. it can survive on plastic and stainless steel for up to 72 h (half-life 5.6–6.8 h) [18]. as these materials are common within operating rooms, it is important to ensure adequate sterilization occurs both before and after surgical cases. there is also good evidence that contamination of said materials within an operating room can be contained by a negative pressure environment [19].there are also questions when it comes to the fidelity of testing, with lippi et al. documenting the limitations of the current reverse transcriptase (rt-pcr) method [20] . the rt-pcr test being used to confirm covid-19 infections was shown to have a significantly high false negative rate of up to 30% with reliability depending on the pre-analytical handling of samples, selection of primers and quality of reagents and equipment [20]. lippi et al. also asserts the limits of detection for the rt-pcr prevents the detection of positive patients with a low viral load, either in the initial phase of infection or following symptom relief [20]. as such, it is important to not be falsely reassured by a negative result. sars-cov-2 has been identified by wang et al. in clinical specimens other than respiratory samples, including feces from 29% of patients, and in blood from a small number of patients. importantly, for urologists, the virus has not been isolated in urine to date [21]. this is pertinent when urologists are considering natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, specifically a transrectal hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery nephrectomy, which uses the rectum to gain access to the peritoneal cavity rather than the abdominal wall [22]. despite being used infrequently, this approach to nephrectomy would lead to potential contamination of the access port and surgical field with sars-cov-2 in addition to colonic bacterial flora, potentially exposing the surgical team at increased risk of infection.while concern regarding the covid-19 pandemic remains ever present, it is important to understand the current gaps within the literature. an example of this ambiguity is the proposed utility in using bacillus calmette guérin (bcg) vaccine to improve sars-cov-2 morbidity and mortality. recent studies have shown countries without a recent or current universal bcg vaccination policy observed a slightly higher sars-cov-2 related morbidity and mortality than those countries that did [23]. this remains hypothetical at this stage without clear evidence. at present the most significant concern for urologists during this pandemic is to safely mitigate the risk of sars-cov-2 infection of both patient and the surgical team by considering the immediate need of a particular procedure, the approach and indeed even ports used to access the abdomen along with managing the surgical plume and having appropriate ppe and adjusting their planning accordingly.we are learning more about covid-19 daily, and as we look toward resumption of elective operating in australia, it is important to consider which surgical procedures remain safest for both the patient and the surgical team alike. the absence of sars-cov-2 in urine provides urologists with some degree of reassurance when performing endoscopic work. however, when weighing the risk and benefits of an open, laparoscopic or robotic procedures, it remains a difficult decision. the theoretical risk of increased transmission posed by laparoscopic surgery needs to be considered. nevertheless, the benefits of a minimally invasive surgical approach are long established, and these theoretical risks remain just that – theoretical. the increase in length of stay, in a high risk hospital environment after open surgery should also not be understated to a patient’s overall risk of infection [8]. we do know delaying a radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer for ≤12 months with no androgen deprivation therapy for all categories of localized prostate cancer is not associated with adverse postoperative outcomes [24]. this provides patients reassurance and allows urologists the opportunity to ensure appropriate time and caution is taken to protect both staff and patients during this pandemic.financial &

onfacebooktwitterlinkedinreddit keywords: cancer patientsflu vaccineimmunological responseinfluenza vaccinationinfluenza virusinvidia studyseasonal influenza & vaccination in cancer patientsseasonal influenza affects every country, community and, consequently, a large number of individuals [1]. recent estimates have recalculated the burden of global influenza. each year, one billion people are affected by influenza, with a high rate of hospitalization. deaths associated with respiratory disease from influenza are between 290,000 and 645,000. cardiovascular disease deaths, which are estimated to represent about half of deaths due to the complications of influenza, must also be considered [2].from a public health point of view, the adult or elderly cancer patient presents the same comorbidities as the general population, which increases with age. it is estimated that more than 20% of the population aged 65 and over have at least two comorbidities, a percentage that reaches more than 50% in people aged at least 75 years of age [3]. patients with malignancies are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications, with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than healthy cohorts. in several studies conducted during the 2009–2010 influenza pandemic, high rates of hospitalization, pneumonia and death (9.5%) were reported among oncological patients [4].although annual vaccination against influenza infection is recommended, vaccination rates among cancer patients are apparently low [5]. few patients with a diagnosis of a malignant disease are advised about influenza vaccination by their treating oncologist. the main reasons for influenza vaccination denial are concerns about interaction with the malignant disease, with cancer treatment and potential side effects [6].a recent cochrane revision reported lower mortality and infection-related outcomes with influenza vaccination, with limited value to support the benefit of vaccination in cancer patients, due to the small number of studies. according to the current evidence, it seems that the benefits of vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza outweigh the potential risks. however, additional placebo or no treatment arms in randomized controlled trials of influenza vaccination among adults with cancer are ethically questionable [7].in addition to traditional vaccines produced in embryonated hen’s eggs, innovative vaccines are currently available, such as the vaccine produced using a seed virus propagated exclusively in cell culture, the recombinant influenza vaccine manufactured in insect cells and the inactivated mammalian cell-grown vaccine [8]. manufacturing influenza virus vaccines using a mammalian cell line rather than embryonated chicken eggs may carry certain advantages. first, they overcome the difficulty of growing influenza viruses, in particular the subtype a/h3n2, in embryonated hen’s eggs. second, they help avoid adaptive mutations of the virus in the course of vaccine production. finally, they accelerate timelines for vaccine composition to keep up with the pace of rapid wild virus evolution and respond to potential future pandemics [8]. the potential benefits deriving from these new products could be translated into a more effective influenza vaccination. moreover, such new techniques will provide basic knowledge for further studies on host-related immune factors and new vaccine formulations (higher doses, use of cell-based or recombinant systems for a single antigen, etc.) and may also help to develop more targeted vaccination strategies against the groups at greatest risk, such as cancer patients.cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade: a special populationas we previously reported in a systematic review, there are no solid data supporting the efficacy of influenza vaccination in the subgroup of cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis) [9]. despite some evidence of good seroconversion rates following influenza vaccination during ici, which were higher when compared with both those of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and even of healthy subjects [10,11], prospective data about safety, clinical efficacy and possible interactions of the flu vaccine with anticancer therapy is still largely unknown. in our opinion, serological efficacy is insufficient to support the routine administration of annual influenza vaccination for ici-treated patients. looking for explorative data, our group conducted the invidia study, which was the first retrospective study reporting results about clinical efficacy and compatibility of influenza vaccination with ici therapy [12,13]. soon after, other similar retrospective analyses [14,15] and limited prospective experiences [16,17] were reported in the literature. considering these studies all together, the evidence related to influenza vaccination during ici therapy in cancer patients is still scarce and controversial and there is a need for more robust data about safety and efficacy in this population.given this unmet clinical need, a multicenter observational trial (the invidia-2 study) is currently collecting prospective data during the 2019–2020 flu season at more than 80 oncology centers in italy, aiming to provide for recommendations on influenza vaccination in cancer patients treated with icis. the invidia-bios ancillary study will also investigate, in a large invidia-2 patient subgroup, the immunological background of the immune response to vaccination during ici, as well as the immune response to ici during vaccination, with the aim of identifying unexplored immunological interactions.immunological insightsthe immunological balance during immune checkpoint blockadethe immune system is a complex network of cells and soluble mediators dedicated to the maintenance of organism integrity. this means not only defending the body from the attacks of external pathogens, but also from possible internal sources of danger (i.e., tumors). this is also known as ‘immune surveillance’ and it is fundamental for the elimination of cancerous cells before they can grow and give rise to tumor masses. immune surveillance can be impaired due to the action of immune regulatory cells or due to mechanisms induced by the tumor itself and/or cells of tumor stroma, leading to tumor growth [18–20]. the t-cell response is regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals, called ‘immune checkpoints’. under normal physiological conditions, immune checkpoints are crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance but also for the protection of tissues from immune-mediated damage when the immune system is responding to exogenous antigens with excessive intensity and/or duration. these immune checkpoints are also involved in the impairment of immunity against tumors, thus have been used as targets for antitumor immune therapy. treatment with icis removes inhibitions in the way between the recognition of tumor antigens and the killing of cancerous cells. the blockade of a general immune-regulatory mechanism not only favors the effector phase of the immune-response against cancer, but in general drives the balance between immune regulation and immune activation in favor of activation. this altered balance can lead the immune response toward autoimmunity, known to be one of the major concerns of ici treatment.influenza vaccination/infection in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapythe immunological balance described above can also result in hyperactivation of a physiological immune response after vaccination during ici therapy, along with a subsequent immune reaction once the host encounters the wild virus he was vaccinated against. in fact, in normal conditions, the vaccine stimulates both t and b cells, providing a protective humoral immunity with poor involvement of the cellular response during the second exposition to the antigen. in the absence of mechanisms related to the regulation of t-cell activation (as seen during ici therapy), the second encounter of the antigen (i.e., flu infection after flu vaccination) can lead to the generation of t-cell-driven systemic inflammations, which are responsible for the appearance of the clinical symptoms of flu infection in vaccinated subjects [21]. this paradoxical immunological phenomenon could underlie the higher rate of influenza infection among vaccinated cancer patients receiving ici, as reported by the invidia retrospective study [12]. on the other hand, the immune hyperactivation after flu vaccination and/or influenza syndrome in patients treated with icis may exert a direct positive effect on antitumor immunity, as suggested by the increase in overall survival in vaccine/virus exposed subjects in the same study ([13], submitted manuscript). in this regard, it is well known how the activation of the immune system against a foreign pathogen may awaken the antitumor immunity via the presence of pathogens associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines. pathogens associated molecular patterns, pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentially vaccine adjuvants not only activate the response against a pathogen’s antigens, but also against a tumor’s antigens via a ‘bystander’ mechanism. the first report of this dates to wb coley, now considered the initiator of cancer immunotherapy. at the end of 1800, he reported the case of a patient affected by an inoperable osteosarcoma of the neck that completely healed from the tumor after a spontaneous local erysipelas infection. after this observation, he published a case series of ten patients affected by tumor, treated with germs obtained by erysipelas infections, now known to be the streptococcus pyogenes [22]. in 1974, zbar and rapp described how to obtain an antitumor effective bacillus calmette–guérin, an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis, which then resulted in the effective intravesical treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [23]. nowadays, the identification of a safe and effective immune adjuvant for the stimulation of antitumor immunity is a primary aim of the immunology research. a fundamental aspect of the bacterial-mediated antitumor therapy is the administration of the microorganism/adjuvant at the tumor site, in order to activate apcs and other cells of the immune system at the tumor level and in draining lymph nodes. this phenomenon does not occur during vaccination but may occur during wild flu infection in lung cancer patients. in these patients, the ongoing treatment with icis, which is responsible for an increased immune/inflammatory response, could induce the activation of intratumoral apcs via a systemic release of cytokines induced by vaccination and/or by spontaneous viral infection. this could be one of the biologic mechanisms underlying the clinical observation reported within the invidia study [12,13].focus on the immunological contextthe tumor microenvironment (tme) is comprised of innate and adaptive immune cells. although a predominant role was reported for adaptive immune cells, with th1 cells promoting a pro-inflammatory status versus th2 cells orchestrating an immunosuppressive phenotype, the innate immune response contributes to the anticancer immunity. natural killer (nk) cells are circulatory, innate lymphoid cells recognized for their cytotoxic effector functions. generally, there are two subsets of nks: cd56hicd16, which secrete inflammatory cytokines and cd56locd16hi, which are specialized in cytotoxic functions, along with cell-mediated killing [24]. within the cancer framework, these cells are extremely efficient in eliminating malignant cells and limiting tumor metastases [24,25]. tumors employ many mechanisms to evade destruction by nks, engaging inhibitory nk receptors and utilizing platelets as a shield to avoid nk detection [25]. many cytokines commonly present in the tme diminish nk effector functions through reduced cytotoxicity, arresting the proliferation and expansion of t cells, enhancing their immune-suppressive properties. another crucial t-cell type that infiltrates the tme is the treg, which is responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and impairing antitumor immune responses. the function of tregs includes direct killing of effector t cells, production of immunosuppressive cytokines and downregulation of co-stimulation by apcs [26]. ctla-4 and pd-1 are well characterized immune co-inhibitory receptors that have been successfully targeted to promote and enhance immune responses against cancer. ctla-4 and pd-1 are both induced on t cells upon t-cell receptor signaling activation. on a hand, ctla-4 is upregulated during the initial stage of t-cell activation, competing with cd28 for the ligands cd86 and cd80 expressed on apcs, thus limiting excessive t-cell priming. on the other hand, pd-1, which is induced later, controls previously activated t cells at the effector sites of immune responses, thus its expression is the marker of t-cell exhaustion. ctla-4 and pd-1 checkpoints are deregulated in tumor-bearing hosts, characterized by chronic predominating ineffective immune responses, resulting in treg induction and t-cell exhaustion [27].in this complex context, vaccine stimulation may create new scenarios through interfering in the immune-mediated innate and adaptive responses. the results reported in the invidia study seem to emphasize the role of added, extrinsic immune stimulation in modulating the efficacy of inhibitory molecules targeting immune checkpoints [12,13]. in cancer patients, the immune status is often modified with prevalence of immunosuppression, thus the direct/indirect viral induced response might impact on the immune patient status, resulting in an antiviral response of which anticancer responses will also benefit from. the recent case of a patient with concomitant primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and melanoma progressing on anti-pd-1 therapy, who developed kaposi’s varicelliform eruption after receiving the first dose of herpes virus-based oncolytic viral therapy, appears to flow in the same direction [28]. the fact that tregs impair function and boost innate populations such as nk may explain part of this process. preliminary evidence shows that in renal cancer patients, a high basal percent of functional nk and increased resistance of effector t cells to treg suppression predicted a better clinical response to treatment with the anti-pd-1 antibody nivolumab [29]. in melanoma, tregs from anti-pd-1 responding patients showed a reduction in treg suppressive capacity [30]. in patients treated with the anti-ctla4 blocking antibody ipilimumab, higher baseline levels of circulating tregs are associated with improved survival [31]. pd-1 blockade increased the resistance of effector t cells to treg suppression and directly reduced the suppressive function of tregs in vitro [31,32]. challenges with flu-vaccine or flu wild viruses could test this status. in addition, the immunological and clinical response to flu infection and/or vaccine could be investigated as a possible biomarker of ici response, as it is being explored within the prospective invidia-2 and invidia-bios studies currently ongoing [33,34].conclusioncancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade represents a new population still to be investigated from the immunological viewpoint. the complex modifications occurring in the immune responses of these individuals against noncancer antigens are largely unknown and they potentially influence the oncological outcome. the intentional introduction of vaccinal antigens could contribute, as a further exogenous immunological stimulus, to shift the balance between tolerance and activation, likely influencing both the tumor context and the complex relationships between the tumor and the host. moreover, the effect of exogenous wild stimuli such as viral or bacterial infections may likely contribute to the immunological ensemble, even potentially interfering with the immune escape from antitumor response. in conclusion, the cancer patient treated with ici can no longer be considered like the entire cancer population undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy, since the target of ici is no longer represented by the tumor, but instead by the immune system [35]. considering this crucial paradigm, the assumptions adopted up today with regard to concomitant medications, vaccinations, true risks from viral or bacterial infections, should be completely discarded and rewritten for this special cancer patient population.acknowledgmentswe gratefully acknowledge all the colleagues from 21 italian centers who contributed to the first invidia study and we are even more grateful to all the colleagues from over

patientsflu vaccineimmunological responseinfluenza vaccinationinfluenza virusinvidia studyseasonal influenza & vaccination in cancer patientsseasonal influenza affects every country, community and, consequently, a large number of individuals [1]. recent estimates have recalculated the burden of global influenza. each year, one billion people are affected by influenza, with a high rate of hospitalization. deaths associated with respiratory disease from influenza are between 290,000 and 645,000. cardiovascular disease deaths, which are estimated to represent about half of deaths due to the complications of influenza, must also be considered [2].from a public health point of view, the adult or elderly cancer patient presents the same comorbidities as the general population, which increases with age. it is estimated that more than 20% of the population aged 65 and over have at least two comorbidities, a percentage that reaches more than 50% in people aged at least 75 years of age [3]. patients with malignancies are at increased risk of serious influenza-related complications, with higher rates of hospitalization and mortality than healthy cohorts. in several studies conducted during the 2009–2010 influenza pandemic, high rates of hospitalization, pneumonia and death (9.5%) were reported among oncological patients [4].although annual vaccination against influenza infection is recommended, vaccination rates among cancer patients are apparently low [5]. few patients with a diagnosis of a malignant disease are advised about influenza vaccination by their treating oncologist. the main reasons for influenza vaccination denial are concerns about interaction with the malignant disease, with cancer treatment and potential side effects [6].a recent cochrane revision reported lower mortality and infection-related outcomes with influenza vaccination, with limited value to support the benefit of vaccination in cancer patients, due to the small number of studies. according to the current evidence, it seems that the benefits of vaccinating adults with cancer against influenza outweigh the potential risks. however, additional placebo or no treatment arms in randomized controlled trials of influenza vaccination among adults with cancer are ethically questionable [7].in addition to traditional vaccines produced in embryonated hen’s eggs, innovative vaccines are currently available, such as the vaccine produced using a seed virus propagated exclusively in cell culture, the recombinant influenza vaccine manufactured in insect cells and the inactivated mammalian cell-grown vaccine [8]. manufacturing influenza virus vaccines using a mammalian cell line rather than embryonated chicken eggs may carry certain advantages. first, they overcome the difficulty of growing influenza viruses, in particular the subtype a/h3n2, in embryonated hen’s eggs. second, they help avoid adaptive mutations of the virus in the course of vaccine production. finally, they accelerate timelines for vaccine composition to keep up with the pace of rapid wild virus evolution and respond to potential future pandemics [8]. the potential benefits deriving from these new products could be translated into a more effective influenza vaccination. moreover, such new techniques will provide basic knowledge for further studies on host-related immune factors and new vaccine formulations (higher doses, use of cell-based or recombinant systems for a single antigen, etc.) and may also help to develop more targeted vaccination strategies against the groups at greatest risk, such as cancer patients.cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade: a special populationas we previously reported in a systematic review, there are no solid data supporting the efficacy of influenza vaccination in the subgroup of cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (icis) [9]. despite some evidence of good seroconversion rates following influenza vaccination during ici, which were higher when compared with both those of cancer patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy and even of healthy subjects [10,11], prospective data about safety, clinical efficacy and possible interactions of the flu vaccine with anticancer therapy is still largely unknown. in our opinion, serological efficacy is insufficient to support the routine administration of annual influenza vaccination for ici-treated patients. looking for explorative data, our group conducted the invidia study, which was the first retrospective study reporting results about clinical efficacy and compatibility of influenza vaccination with ici therapy [12,13]. soon after, other similar retrospective analyses [14,15] and limited prospective experiences [16,17] were reported in the literature. considering these studies all together, the evidence related to influenza vaccination during ici therapy in cancer patients is still scarce and controversial and there is a need for more robust data about safety and efficacy in this population.given this unmet clinical need, a multicenter observational trial (the invidia-2 study) is currently collecting prospective data during the 2019–2020 flu season at more than 80 oncology centers in italy, aiming to provide for recommendations on influenza vaccination in cancer patients treated with icis. the invidia-bios ancillary study will also investigate, in a large invidia-2 patient subgroup, the immunological background of the immune response to vaccination during ici, as well as the immune response to ici during vaccination, with the aim of identifying unexplored immunological interactions.immunological insightsthe immunological balance during immune checkpoint blockadethe immune system is a complex network of cells and soluble mediators dedicated to the maintenance of organism integrity. this means not only defending the body from the attacks of external pathogens, but also from possible internal sources of danger (i.e., tumors). this is also known as ‘immune surveillance’ and it is fundamental for the elimination of cancerous cells before they can grow and give rise to tumor masses. immune surveillance can be impaired due to the action of immune regulatory cells or due to mechanisms induced by the tumor itself and/or cells of tumor stroma, leading to tumor growth [18–20]. the t-cell response is regulated by a balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals, called ‘immune checkpoints’. under normal physiological conditions, immune checkpoints are crucial for the maintenance of self-tolerance but also for the protection of tissues from immune-mediated damage when the immune system is responding to exogenous antigens with excessive intensity and/or duration. these immune checkpoints are also involved in the impairment of immunity against tumors, thus have been used as targets for antitumor immune therapy. treatment with icis removes inhibitions in the way between the recognition of tumor antigens and the killing of cancerous cells. the blockade of a general immune-regulatory mechanism not only favors the effector phase of the immune-response against cancer, but in general drives the balance between immune regulation and immune activation in favor of activation. this altered balance can lead the immune response toward autoimmunity, known to be one of the major concerns of ici treatment.influenza vaccination/infection in patients undergoing immune checkpoint inhibitor therapythe immunological balance described above can also result in hyperactivation of a physiological immune response after vaccination during ici therapy, along with a subsequent immune reaction once the host encounters the wild virus he was vaccinated against. in fact, in normal conditions, the vaccine stimulates both t and b cells, providing a protective humoral immunity with poor involvement of the cellular response during the second exposition to the antigen. in the absence of mechanisms related to the regulation of t-cell activation (as seen during ici therapy), the second encounter of the antigen (i.e., flu infection after flu vaccination) can lead to the generation of t-cell-driven systemic inflammations, which are responsible for the appearance of the clinical symptoms of flu infection in vaccinated subjects [21]. this paradoxical immunological phenomenon could underlie the higher rate of influenza infection among vaccinated cancer patients receiving ici, as reported by the invidia retrospective study [12]. on the other hand, the immune hyperactivation after flu vaccination and/or influenza syndrome in patients treated with icis may exert a direct positive effect on antitumor immunity, as suggested by the increase in overall survival in vaccine/virus exposed subjects in the same study ([13], submitted manuscript). in this regard, it is well known how the activation of the immune system against a foreign pathogen may awaken the antitumor immunity via the presence of pathogens associated molecular patterns and pro-inflammatory cytokines. pathogens associated molecular patterns, pro-inflammatory cytokines and potentially vaccine adjuvants not only activate the response against a pathogen’s antigens, but also against a tumor’s antigens via a ‘bystander’ mechanism. the first report of this dates to wb coley, now considered the initiator of cancer immunotherapy. at the end of 1800, he reported the case of a patient affected by an inoperable osteosarcoma of the neck that completely healed from the tumor after a spontaneous local erysipelas infection. after this observation, he published a case series of ten patients affected by tumor, treated with germs obtained by erysipelas infections, now known to be the streptococcus pyogenes [22]. in 1974, zbar and rapp described how to obtain an antitumor effective bacillus calmette–guérin, an attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis, which then resulted in the effective intravesical treatment of nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [23]. nowadays, the identification of a safe and effective immune adjuvant for the stimulation of antitumor immunity is a primary aim of the immunology research. a fundamental aspect of the bacterial-mediated antitumor therapy is the administration of the microorganism/adjuvant at the tumor site, in order to activate apcs and other cells of the immune system at the tumor level and in draining lymph nodes. this phenomenon does not occur during vaccination but may occur during wild flu infection in lung cancer patients. in these patients, the ongoing treatment with icis, which is responsible for an increased immune/inflammatory response, could induce the activation of intratumoral apcs via a systemic release of cytokines induced by vaccination and/or by spontaneous viral infection. this could be one of the biologic mechanisms underlying the clinical observation reported within the invidia study [12,13].focus on the immunological contextthe tumor microenvironment (tme) is comprised of innate and adaptive immune cells. although a predominant role was reported for adaptive immune cells, with th1 cells promoting a pro-inflammatory status versus th2 cells orchestrating an immunosuppressive phenotype, the innate immune response contributes to the anticancer immunity. natural killer (nk) cells are circulatory, innate lymphoid cells recognized for their cytotoxic effector functions. generally, there are two subsets of nks: cd56hicd16, which secrete inflammatory cytokines and cd56locd16hi, which are specialized in cytotoxic functions, along with cell-mediated killing [24]. within the cancer framework, these cells are extremely efficient in eliminating malignant cells and limiting tumor metastases [24,25]. tumors employ many mechanisms to evade destruction by nks, engaging inhibitory nk receptors and utilizing platelets as a shield to avoid nk detection [25]. many cytokines commonly present in the tme diminish nk effector functions through reduced cytotoxicity, arresting the proliferation and expansion of t cells, enhancing their immune-suppressive properties. another crucial t-cell type that infiltrates the tme is the treg, which is responsible for maintaining self-tolerance and impairing antitumor immune responses. the function of tregs includes direct killing of effector t cells, production of immunosuppressive cytokines and downregulation of co-stimulation by apcs [26]. ctla-4 and pd-1 are well characterized immune co-inhibitory receptors that have been successfully targeted to promote and enhance immune responses against cancer. ctla-4 and pd-1 are both induced on t cells upon t-cell receptor signaling activation. on a hand, ctla-4 is upregulated during the initial stage of t-cell activation, competing with cd28 for the ligands cd86 and cd80 expressed on apcs, thus limiting excessive t-cell priming. on the other hand, pd-1, which is induced later, controls previously activated t cells at the effector sites of immune responses, thus its expression is the marker of t-cell exhaustion. ctla-4 and pd-1 checkpoints are deregulated in tumor-bearing hosts, characterized by chronic predominating ineffective immune responses, resulting in treg induction and t-cell exhaustion [27].in this complex context, vaccine stimulation may create new scenarios through interfering in the immune-mediated innate and adaptive responses. the results reported in the invidia study seem to emphasize the role of added, extrinsic immune stimulation in modulating the efficacy of inhibitory molecules targeting immune checkpoints [12,13]. in cancer patients, the immune status is often modified with prevalence of immunosuppression, thus the direct/indirect viral induced response might impact on the immune patient status, resulting in an antiviral response of which anticancer responses will also benefit from. the recent case of a patient with concomitant primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma and melanoma progressing on anti-pd-1 therapy, who developed kaposi’s varicelliform eruption after receiving the first dose of herpes virus-based oncolytic viral therapy, appears to flow in the same direction [28]. the fact that tregs impair function and boost innate populations such as nk may explain part of this process. preliminary evidence shows that in renal cancer patients, a high basal percent of functional nk and increased resistance of effector t cells to treg suppression predicted a better clinical response to treatment with the anti-pd-1 antibody nivolumab [29]. in melanoma, tregs from anti-pd-1 responding patients showed a reduction in treg suppressive capacity [30]. in patients treated with the anti-ctla4 blocking antibody ipilimumab, higher baseline levels of circulating tregs are associated with improved survival [31]. pd-1 blockade increased the resistance of effector t cells to treg suppression and directly reduced the suppressive function of tregs in vitro [31,32]. challenges with flu-vaccine or flu wild viruses could test this status. in addition, the immunological and clinical response to flu infection and/or vaccine could be investigated as a possible biomarker of ici response, as it is being explored within the prospective invidia-2 and invidia-bios studies currently ongoing [33,34].conclusioncancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade represents a new population still to be investigated from the immunological viewpoint. the complex modifications occurring in the immune responses of these individuals against noncancer antigens are largely unknown and they potentially influence the oncological outcome. the intentional introduction of vaccinal antigens could contribute, as a further exogenous immunological stimulus, to shift the balance between tolerance and activation, likely influencing both the tumor context and the complex relationships between the tumor and the host. moreover, the effect of exogenous wild stimuli such as viral or bacterial infections may likely contribute to the immunological ensemble, even potentially interfering with the immune escape from antitumor response. in conclusion, the cancer patient treated with ici can no longer be considered like the entire cancer population undergoing chemotherapy or targeted therapy, since the target of ici is no longer represented by the tumor, but instead by the immune system [35]. considering this crucial paradigm, the assumptions adopted up today with regard to concomitant medications, vaccinations, true risks from viral or bacterial infections, should be completely discarded and rewritten for this special cancer patient population.acknowledgmentswe

the new year!over the past year the impact factor of immunotherapy has seen a large increase up to 4.196 (2020). we wish to express our gratitude to all our previous authors who have published their research with us over the recent years, this increase in impact factor is a testament to the important work you have performed and published with us.after the tough recent times globally, we still have many papers covering the pressing issue of covid-19 and its' treatment. however, we also continue to publish many highly impactful papers across our scope discussing cancer, allergens and suppressive immunotherapies, combination therapies, biomarkers for individualized treatment and novel agents and their targets.in this foreword i would like to take this opportunity to look back on the previous year’s highlights of immunotherapy and summarize the most well received papers of 2021 that i would encourage you to read if you have missed them.content highlights of 2021throughout volume 13 of immunotherapy we continued to publish high impact content across the range of topics covered under immunotherapy. the top five most read papers published in the journal in 2021 are

commentary 'immunity to glycan α-gal and possibilities for the control of covid-19' [1]. in this piece de la fuente et al. commented on the possibility that boosting the immune response to glycan α-gal with a broader and not pathogen-specific immunity may contribute to the control of covid-19 and also to potential reinfections by covid-19 variants or pathogens.sands et al.‘s clinical trial protocol detailing their accio three arm study evaluating the efficacy of pembrolizumab addition to the current chemotherapy standard of care treatment for resected non-small-cell lung cancer was our second most read paper of those published in 2021 [2].our most highly read research article from 2021 outlined the first in-human study of pasotuxizumab, a bispecific t-cell engager targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen [3]. the data from hummel et al. supported pasotuxizumab safety in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and provided evidence of bispecific t-cell engager monotherapy efficacy in solid tumors.our fourth and fifth most read papers were both focused on covid-19. ali et al. investigated the feasibility of producing hyperimmune anti-covid-19 intravenously administrable immunoglobulin from pooled convalescent plasma. the aim was to provide a safe and effective passive immunization treatment option with the safety and efficacy of this crucial groundwork is now being evaluated by clinical trial [4]. additionally, the paper has been the second highest cited paper that was published in immunotherapy in 2021.meanwhile pinheiro et al. provided their unique perspective on the proposed role for vitamin d and dpp-4 inhibitors to modulate cytokine storm, reduce the virulence of sars-cov-2 and prevent disease progression [5]. furthermore, they provided investigation rationale for this proposed vidpp-4i combination strategy, in a paper that was one of the most discussed papers across social media and was also one of our highly cited papers of the year.as well as readership, the number of citations also gives an indication of the most impactful papers from this year, of which the top three most cited are shown in

350 b.c.esince its first report in wuhan, china, in december 2019, the novel pandemic covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2 virus), has rampaged throughout the world. approximately 80% of the covid-19 patients manifest with only mild upper respiratory symptoms, 10-15% develop bilateral infiltrated pneumonia, and 5 to 10% of the severe cases progress to develop acute respiratory disease syndrome (ards) and multiple organs failure by the ‘cytokine releasing storm’ (crs).1 older age, male gender, chronic cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are among the risk factors associated with severe covid-19.2 asthmatics are known to be more frequently infected and at a greater risk of developing more severe outcomes with respiratory/common cold viral infections, particularly in those with poorly controlled asthma.3moreover, there is a deficiency and delay of the production of type i and type iii interferons in the lung cells of asthmatic patients, potentially more favorable for sars-cov2 infection that depends on a hampered innate anti-virus immune response in the respiratory tract.3 however, recent reports have accumulated evidences that the prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma in patients with covid-19 is lower than expected and underrepresented among other comorbidities and risk factors of the severe form of covid-19.4-6 li et al.5 reported that the prevalence of asthma in patients with severe covid-19 (n= 269, 49.1% of total 548 patients) was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of wuhan. moreover, none of the children (below 12 years of age) infected with sars-cov2 at the wuhan children’s hospital had underlying asthma.6 these findings on the low prevalence of asthma may be confounded by a sampling bias (all hospitalized patients) in the reported cases, underdiagnoses, or lack of recognition of asthma in those with covid-19. in fact, lack of surveys of the confirmed covid-19 cases in the general population is a major limiting factor in answering the question whether chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, are key risk factors of sars-cov2 infection.4however, the interesting question to ask is why asthmatic patients did not have an increased exacerbation of asthma or became more prone to the severe form of covid-19 after being infected with sars-cov2? we, therefore, propose the following plausible mechanisms in asthmatic patients that may have effects in the determination of the susceptibility and severity regarding sars-cov2 infection. firstly, coronavirus recognition and infection is dependent on the cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) for ducking spike protein of sars-cov2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2) to cleave the ducked spike protein for virus entry by membrane fusion.7 lung cells that co-express these two molecules include nasal goblet secretory cells, bronchial transient secretory cells, and alveolar type ii pneumocytes.8the gene expression levels of ace2 and tmprss2 are influenced by the genetic variants of the host, microbial infections, and induced by innate immune response, such as the production of interferons and mucins.8 it has been found that sars-cov2 virus can hijack and enhance this innate anti-virus defense interferon production to induce ace2, a human interferon stimulated gene (isg), expression in the other uninfected cells, and promote its potential transmission and spread.8 while in asthma patients, the expression of these two molecules in the respiratory epithelial cells for sars-cov2 infection are determined by the age, gender, comorbidity and type 2 allergic inflammation. jackson et al. found asthma and respiratory allergy are associated with reduced ace2 expression in airway cells based on their patient cohorts.9 moreover, ace2 expression in the lower airway epithelium was lower in the post–allergen challenge samples, and its levels of expression was also significantly inversely associated with type 2 immune inflammation biomarkers. 9 in contrast, in an analysis of the nasal airway epithelial transcriptome in 695 children, sajuthi et al.10 demonstrated that tmprss2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 allergic inflammation mainly by interleukin-13. peters et al.11 from the same group, found the gene expression for ace2 and tmprss2 in the cells obtained from induced sputum did not differ between healthy and asthmatics. instead, a higher expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in males, african americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthmatic subgroups for poor covid19 outcomes.11 therefore, these reports did not describe convincing information as to whether the asthmatic patients had a lower expression of ace2 and serine protease tmprss2 for sars-cov2 based on their allergic status and/or chronic lung inflammation. particularly, these studies lacked information on the effect of sars- cov-2- specific analysis and observations in asthmatic patients to be able to reach a conclusion in the real world.secondly, viral load and immune response of the host determines the final outcome and/or the severity of ards and multiple organ failures in covid-19 patients. at the initial phase, antivirus innate immune response determine the clearance of virus by the production of type i/iii interferons of infected cells. lack of or lowered production of ifnα2 and ifnλ, and high viral loads are frequently found in the severe cases that deteriorated into needing icu care.12 at the second phase of covid-19 infection, aberrant host immune response by infected macrophages that lead to cytokines releasing storm, and t lymphocytes depletion due to the prolonged viral infection are the two major determining factors for a final clinical outcome.12 for asthmatic patients, the innate immune response to covid-19 infection may be impaired due to lower levels of ifnγ in their bronchial epithelial cells, but it may also turn into favor for reducing ace2 expression, which is depended on ifnγ production.8 in addition to ifns, there are other molecules of innate immunity in the respiratory tract that may also have anti-viral functions, such as mannose binding lectin (mbl), and surfactant protein a (sp-a) and d (sp-d) that are produced by alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, which are also the largely infected by sars coronavirus. these molecules, mbl and sp-d, found in higher concentrations in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluids (balf) of patients with asthma and respiratory allergy and are increased due to chronic inflammation, have been identified to bind spike protein of sars coronavirus, and inhibit its binding to ace2 cellular receptor, and thereby able to protect the alveolar macrophages from virus-induced activation.13, 14recently, it is found that long-term boosting of the innate immune responses, also termed ‘trained immunity’, by prior microbial infection or certain live vaccines, induces heterologous protection against infections, through epigenetic, transcriptional and functional reprogramming of innate immune cells.15 experimental studies have demonstrated that alveolar or lung macrophages can also undergo long-term reprogramming after infections. for example, gamma herpes virus infection can protect against an allergic response in experimental asthma,16 while adenovirus infection-induced remodeling in alveolar macrophages and subsequently induced more pronounced anti-bacterial immunity.17this trained immunity in the myeloid cells and alveolar macrophages of asthmatics may provide anti-viral immunity in specific organs such as the lungs. although this hypothesis has not been validated in patients with covid-19, clinical trials to booster trained innate immunity by bcg vaccination to protect against covid-19 have been initiated in several countries.18finally, we highlight that therapeutic medications and biologics used for asthma control may have some beneficial pharmacological effects in covid-19 infections. from in-vitro models, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators have been shown to suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production.19 asthmatic patients using inhaled corticosteroids (ics) demonstrated lower expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in their bronchial epithelial cells.11 there is a clinical report of the improvement in three covid-19 patients after using inhaled ciclesonide, although this study did not have proper controls.20 before the outbreak of covid-19, clinical observation in children with severe asthma who received anti-ige monoclonal antibody (omalizumab) have shown decreased duration of human rhinovirus (hrv) infections, viral shedding, and risk of hrv-related illnesses compared with guideline-driven care alone.21in vitro, omalizumab attenuated plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pdc) fcεriα protein expression while simultaneously augmenting pdc ifn-α responses to hrv and influenza virus.22 together, these findings provide direct evidence that blocking ige decreases susceptibility to respiratory viral illnesses through enhanced ifn-α responses in pdcs. whether this anti-virus effect by anti-ige treatment also includes infection with coronavirus and sars-cov2 is an open question that remains to be verified. more interestingly, azithromycin combined with hydroxychloroquine in an open-label non-randomized clinical trial for covid-19 patients, has significant decreased the viral load after six days of treatment compared to untreated controls.23azithromycin has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of asthma exacerbation and improve the quality of life of asthmatic adults and preschool children with asthma that was not adequately controlled on standard inhaler therapy.24 although the mechanisms of this anti-inflammatory effect in asthma is still not well defined, some studies presented a reduction of il-6 levels after azithromycin treatment.25 moreover, a relevant study from gielen and co-workers demonstrated that azithromycin augments ifn-β and ifn-λ production and decreasing rhinovirus replication and release from rhinovirus-infected human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.26 hence, it is suggested that azithromycin may have protective effects in reducing sars-cov-2 invasion by interfering with ligand/cd147 receptor interactions, a novel sars-cov2 cellular receptors beside ace2, and decreasing the expression of some metalloproteinase (downstream to cd147) in primary human bronchial epithelial infected with rhinovirus.27 however, controlled clinical trials using azithromycin to treat patients with covid-19 (not involving asthmatic subjects) are now registered in several countries with results still pending.in summary, we have seen a new zoonotic coronavirus, sars-cov2, infection that has had a devastating effect on the host immunity via the inhibition of interferons leading to aberrant innate immune response, macrophages inflammation in cytokine releasing storm, and exhaustion of the cellular immunity of t lymphocytes.28 in contrast, due to chronic and sustained type 2 immune inflammation in the lungs of asthmatic patients, or fortunately by the medications they use for asthma control, it seems asthma may not be a major confounding disease in covid-19 infection, and this unexpected phenomenon may throw a new light in finding therapies or preventative strategies for sars-cov2 (figure 1 ). we still need a more comprehensive and in-depth immune analysis of sars-cov2 infection in the coming days to explore this hypothesis. however, all standard asthma therapies, whether inhaled steroids, combination of inhaled steroid plus long acting bronchodilator therapies, or monoclonal antibodies like omalizumab and azithromycin, should be continued to be used to optimize asthma control as recommended by all medical societies, for they can not only substantially reduce the risk of asthma exacerbation, but also will reduce risks and severe outcomes of covid-19.",2020,"2023-07-03 03:14:59","2023-07-03 03:14:59",NA,"",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Type:

unlucky? main text:“misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.” tao-te-ching (book of the way) by lao-tzu, 350 b.c.esince its first report in wuhan, china, in december 2019, the novel pandemic covid-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov2 virus), has rampaged throughout the world. approximately 80% of the covid-19 patients manifest with only mild upper respiratory symptoms, 10-15% develop bilateral infiltrated pneumonia, and 5 to 10% of the severe cases progress to develop acute respiratory disease syndrome (ards) and multiple organs failure by the ‘cytokine releasing storm’ (crs).1 older age, male gender, chronic cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are among the risk factors associated with severe covid-19.2 asthmatics are known to be more frequently infected and at a greater risk of developing more severe outcomes with respiratory/common cold viral infections, particularly in those with poorly controlled asthma.3moreover, there is a deficiency and delay of the production of type i and type iii interferons in the lung cells of asthmatic patients, potentially more favorable for sars-cov2 infection that depends on a hampered innate anti-virus immune response in the respiratory tract.3 however, recent reports have accumulated evidences that the prevalence of allergic diseases and asthma in patients with covid-19 is lower than expected and underrepresented among other comorbidities and risk factors of the severe form of covid-19.4-6 li et al.5 reported that the prevalence of asthma in patients with severe covid-19 (n= 269, 49.1% of total 548 patients) was 0.9%, markedly lower than that in the adult population of wuhan. moreover, none of the children (below 12 years of age) infected with sars-cov2 at the wuhan children’s hospital had underlying asthma.6 these findings on the low prevalence of asthma may be confounded by a sampling bias (all hospitalized patients) in the reported cases, underdiagnoses, or lack of recognition of asthma in those with covid-19. in fact, lack of surveys of the confirmed covid-19 cases in the general population is a major limiting factor in answering the question whether chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, are key risk factors of sars-cov2 infection.4however, the interesting question to ask is why asthmatic patients did not have an increased exacerbation of asthma or became more prone to the severe form of covid-19 after being infected with sars-cov2? we, therefore, propose the following plausible mechanisms in asthmatic patients that may have effects in the determination of the susceptibility and severity regarding sars-cov2 infection. firstly, coronavirus recognition and infection is dependent on the cellular receptors, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ace2) for ducking spike protein of sars-cov2, and transmembrane protease serine 2 (tmprss2) to cleave the ducked spike protein for virus entry by membrane fusion.7 lung cells that co-express these two molecules include nasal goblet secretory cells, bronchial transient secretory cells, and alveolar type ii pneumocytes.8the gene expression levels of ace2 and tmprss2 are influenced by the genetic variants of the host, microbial infections, and induced by innate immune response, such as the production of interferons and mucins.8 it has been found that sars-cov2 virus can hijack and enhance this innate anti-virus defense interferon production to induce ace2, a human interferon stimulated gene (isg), expression in the other uninfected cells, and promote its potential transmission and spread.8 while in asthma patients, the expression of these two molecules in the respiratory epithelial cells for sars-cov2 infection are determined by the age, gender, comorbidity and type 2 allergic inflammation. jackson et al. found asthma and respiratory allergy are associated with reduced ace2 expression in airway cells based on their patient cohorts.9 moreover, ace2 expression in the lower airway epithelium was lower in the post–allergen challenge samples, and its levels of expression was also significantly inversely associated with type 2 immune inflammation biomarkers. 9 in contrast, in an analysis of the nasal airway epithelial transcriptome in 695 children, sajuthi et al.10 demonstrated that tmprss2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 allergic inflammation mainly by interleukin-13. peters et al.11 from the same group, found the gene expression for ace2 and tmprss2 in the cells obtained from induced sputum did not differ between healthy and asthmatics. instead, a higher expression of ace2 and tmprss2 in males, african americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthmatic subgroups for poor covid19 outcomes.11 therefore, these reports did not describe convincing information as to whether the asthmatic patients had a lower expression of ace2 and serine protease tmprss2 for sars-cov2 based on their allergic status and/or chronic lung inflammation. particularly, these studies lacked information on the effect of sars- cov-2- specific analysis and observations in asthmatic patients to be able to reach a conclusion in the real world.secondly, viral load and immune response of the host determines the final outcome and/or the severity of ards and multiple organ failures in covid-19 patients. at the initial phase, antivirus innate immune response determine the clearance of virus by the production of type i/iii interferons of infected cells. lack of or lowered production of ifnα2 and ifnλ, and high viral loads are frequently found in the severe cases that deteriorated into needing icu care.12 at the second phase of covid-19 infection, aberrant host immune response by infected macrophages that lead to cytokines releasing storm, and t lymphocytes depletion due to the prolonged viral infection are the two major determining factors for a final clinical outcome.12 for asthmatic patients, the innate immune response to covid-19 infection may be impaired due to lower levels of ifnγ in their bronchial epithelial cells, but it may also turn into favor for reducing ace2 expression, which is depended on ifnγ production.8 in addition to ifns, there are other molecules of innate immunity in the respiratory tract that may also have anti-viral functions, such as mannose binding lectin (mbl), and surfactant protein a (sp-a) and d (sp-d) that are produced by alveolar type 2 cells in the lung, which are also the

syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel human coronavirus12, has infected close to 22 million people and killed about 0.77 million people in more than 200 countries (as of august 18, 2020)3. given the fact that sars-cov-2 poses an unprecedented threat in terms of transmission and mortality, the world health organization has geared up efforts to control, contain and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the development of a vaccine has a high attrition rate and involves linear steps of clinical trial and evaluation. for those systems that have been tested on humans previously, parallel testing can involve both animals and phase i human trials4. although some of the potential covid-19 vaccine candidates have made it through phase i and ii clinical trials, mass availability of covid-19 vaccine could only be possible by 20215. repurposing of the existing drugs and development of vaccines are thus feasible options to protect people from the severity of the covid-19 pandemic. host immunity plays a crucial role in the elimination of viruses and prevents disease progression. strategies to boost the same, especially during incubation and non-severe phase of sars-cov-2 infection, can be a viable option to check disease severity. bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) induces non-specific protection against a range of bacteria and viruses6. therefore, it is worth exploring the immunostimulatory and protective potential of bcg against sars-cov-2 infection. bcg is a live attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis widely used as a vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis (tb) caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb). intradermal/subcutaneous delivery of bcg vaccine protects against disseminated forms of tb in children and provides variable protection against pulmonary tb in adults78. recent reports suggest that the efficacy of bcg can be improved by selective delipidation of the outer membrane or alternative route of delivery910. bcg immunization elicits non-specific immunological outcomes that prevent general infections and reduce mortality caused by unrelated pathogens6, besides amplifying responses to other paediatric vaccines11. bcg has long been employed as an immunotherapeutic agent or adjuvant for preventing recurrence and progression of bladder cancer12. a recent report13 suggests that the potential of bcg in preventing sars-cov-2 infection may be validated among hyper-susceptible population subset such as the front line healthcare personnel and the elderly people. clinical trials to test the efficacy of bcg in boosting the immune system against sars-cov-2, have been initiated in the netherlands (nct04417335), australia (nct04327206) and columbia (nct04362124) (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). host pattern recognition receptors (prrs), expressed by innate immune cells, interact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) of viruses and initiate innate immune response against viral pathogens. many of the pamps are common among different species of bacteria and viruses. multiple families of prrs such as nod-like receptors, rig-l-like receptors and toll-like receptors detect viral proteins, which in turn induce interferons and cytokines, aiding in the elimination of the virus. it is tempting to speculate that immune response against bcg may cross-recognize sars-cov-2-associated pamps and confer immunity against this infection. prior immunization with bcg or re-vaccination with bcg in adults can induce ‘trained immunity’ (innate immune memory), a term used to describe the possible mechanism(s) underlying heterologous protection induced by bcg against non-mycobacterial antigens. the trained immunity is a kind of conditioning of the innate immune cells, mainly monocytes/macrophages/natural killer cells, to undergo specific epigenetic changes (including de-methylation/de-acetylation) in the genes associated with mounting a robust and non-specific immune response14, resulting in a heightened recall response by primed innate immune cells upon a second encounter to the same/different/broad range of unrelated microbial pamps. the degree of immunological response has been correlated with the chromatin accessibility at the genome regions controlling immune response15. regulatory rna species, including long non-coding rnas and micrornas, have also emerged as the regulators of epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, besides substantial rewiring of host metabolic landscape with a predominant shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis14. in humans, limited documentation exists on the impact of unintended protective effects of bcg against viral infections. bcg-immunized mice exhibited higher resistance to influenza viral infection challenge as compared to the unvaccinated mice16. arts et al17 reported significantly low levels of viraemia in bcg-vaccinated human volunteers challenged with experimental yellow fever virus (attenuated strain), and the bcg-induced protection correlated with increased production of interleukin (il)-1β. consistent with these studies, bcg re-vaccination induced innate and adaptive immune responses in adult tb patients18 also suggest its utility to renew response against mycobacteria and other unrelated pathogens possibly via induction of trained immunity. mtbvac, a live attenuated mtb vaccine strain, provides long-term non-specific immunological effect on innate trained immunity in addition to adaptive immune response19. kleinnijenhuis et al20 have demonstrated that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and il-6 remain elevated up to one year post-bcg vaccination and subsequently waned. in line with previous reports showing beneficial non-specific immune potentiating effects of bcg vaccine, one can logically speculate that bcg vaccination (or re-vaccination in countries with universal bcg immunization) may lead to improved clinical outcomes in viral or other respiratory tract infections, including sars-cov-2. a recent ecological study has suggested that countries where bcg is part of the immunization schedule, the extent of mortality and morbidity due to covid-19 is significantly reduced, and may be able to contain the spread of sars-cov-2 better than those countries which did not have bcg vaccination21. the differences in the number of sars-cov-2-infected cases between countries adhering to the universal bcg vaccination policy and those where universal bcg vaccination is not a policy were evaluated, based on the data of covid-19 cases across the globe (https://www.coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and bcg vaccination status from bcg world atlas database22. it was observed that in countries where bcg was a part of the immunization schedule, covid-19 cases/100,000 population were almost similar to those where bcg was not a part of universal vaccination schedule (figure a). however, the cause-specific death rate/100,000 population was significantly lower in countries having bcg immunization policy, compared to those where a universal bcg vaccination policy did not exist (figure b). this suggests that bcg vaccination-induced non-specific immunity may be associated with the mitigation of disease severity in covid-19-pandemic areas.figure: scatter plot showing differences in the number of confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection (a) and cause-specific death rate (b) per 100,000 population between countries having universal bcg vaccination policy (bcg+ countries) and countries that do not have a universal bcg vaccination policy (bcg− countries). the description of the different colour and symbols is as follows: european countries (sky blue square), asian countries (red circle), middle east countries (yellow square), african countries (brown diamond), north american countries (purple upright triangle), south american countries (green inverted triangle) and australia (grey hexagon). the countries represented in the graph are those with >3000 confirmed covid-19 cases, as of july 9, 2020. the significance of the two data sets was tested using unpaired, non-parametric student's t test using graphpad prism software version 6.7 (san diego, ca, usa) and is shown on the top of the plot (ns, non-significant; *** p<0.001).source: http://www.bcgatlas.org; http://www.gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com.we hypothesized that prior bcg vaccination status was associated with the extent of the covid-19 epidemic. because covid-19 cases started or peaked at different time periods and the infection or death rate stabilized differently among various countries, it posed a limitation to the current study. our results, therefore, are a pointer rather than final conclusion about the role of bcg in arresting the covid-19 pandemic. to have a more definitive picture, the association of bcg vaccination with the protection or recovery from the sars-cov-2 infection must be reinforced with the data available at the individual level. a more comprehensive comparison of bcg-vaccinated individuals on the basis of age at the time of vaccination or re-vaccination may provide critical evidence and logical conclusion for ascertaining the use of bcg in the prevention of covid-19. a significant amount of work has been done to engineer bcg to enhance its immune-boosting and protective properties. vpm1002, a genetically engineered bcg, exhibits improved immunogenicity23, has completed phase i clinical trial in germany (nct00749034) and phase ii clinical trial in south africa (nct01479972) and is currently in phase iii clinical trials in india (nct03152903) for assessing the prevalence of tb recurrence in drug-treated individuals. a separate phase iii trial of vpm1002 (nct04387409) has also been initiated to assess healthcare professionals’ absenteeism during the covid-19 pandemic in germany (table). vpm1002 was engineered to survive within the phagosome (unlike bcg), and was equipped with listeriolysin (from listeria) to perforate phagosomal membrane. vpm1002 has also been reported to prevent recurrence of bladder tumours, highlighting its non-specific benefits. another recombinant bcg strain overexpressing sting (stimulator of interferon genes)-agonist has shown significantly augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine response and protective efficacy in mice and guinea pigs challenged with mtb24.table: role of bacille calmette-guerin (bcg), recombinant bcg, attenuated mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) or m. indicus pranii (mip) as immunotherapy and possible intervention against covid-19alternatively, immunogenic components of bcg, such as muramyl dipeptide, can also be tested as an adjunct therapy for immune stimulation in those at high-risk to be affected with covid-19. in addition to being broadly protective, safe and immunogenic, bcg is cost-effective, easy to produce in bulk and, therefore, may be suitable in terms of both availability and affordability. however, before exploiting bcg-induced training of innate immune responses against infections by unrelated pathogens, several potentially confounding factors such as host genetic polymorphisms, endemicity to other viral/bacterial infections and route of immunization need to be examined. of particular note is the association of bcg vaccination, with some adverse effects such as formation of abscess and lymphadenitis and local cutaneous inflammation2829. intravesical bcg therapy for the treatment of non-invasive bladder cancer has resulted in short period of fever and discomfort in majority of the patients30. clinical trials for testing the efficacy of bcg, administered (or re-administration) through a conventional or alternate route910, against sars-cov-2 can be initiated as an interim intervention against covid-19. the pros and cons of diverting the stock of bcg as a temporary measure for non-specific protection till actual vaccines for covid-19 are commercially available must be deliberated upon, as it should not limit the supply of bcg for the people in tb-infected endemic regions. therefore, it is important to explore agents similar to bcg that can act as immunomodulator. in this regard, it is equally tempting to suggest another mycobacteria discovered in india, mycobacterium indicus pranii (mip)31, earlier known as mw. mip has been found to be a strong immunomodulator with proven utility as an adjunct therapy for leprosy treatment25, category ii tb26 in humans and in inducing tumour regression27, and possibly functions by invoking trained immunity (table).",2020,"2023-07-03 03:14:53","2023-07-03

immunization arrest the covid-19 pandemic? severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), a novel human coronavirus12, has infected close to 22 million people and killed about 0.77 million people in more than 200 countries (as of august 18, 2020)3. given the fact that sars-cov-2 poses an unprecedented threat in terms of transmission and mortality, the world health organization has geared up efforts to control, contain and prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). the development of a vaccine has a high attrition rate and involves linear steps of clinical trial and evaluation. for those systems that have been tested on humans previously, parallel testing can involve both animals and phase i human trials4. although some of the potential covid-19 vaccine candidates have made it through phase i and ii clinical trials, mass availability of covid-19 vaccine could only be possible by 20215. repurposing of the existing drugs and development of vaccines are thus feasible options to protect people from the severity of the covid-19 pandemic. host immunity plays a crucial role in the elimination of viruses and prevents disease progression. strategies to boost the same, especially during incubation and non-severe phase of sars-cov-2 infection, can be a viable option to check disease severity. bacille calmette-guerin (bcg) induces non-specific protection against a range of bacteria and viruses6. therefore, it is worth exploring the immunostimulatory and protective potential of bcg against sars-cov-2 infection. bcg is a live attenuated strain of mycobacterium bovis widely used as a vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis (tb) caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb). intradermal/subcutaneous delivery of bcg vaccine protects against disseminated forms of tb in children and provides variable protection against pulmonary tb in adults78. recent reports suggest that the efficacy of bcg can be improved by selective delipidation of the outer membrane or alternative route of delivery910. bcg immunization elicits non-specific immunological outcomes that prevent general infections and reduce mortality caused by unrelated pathogens6, besides amplifying responses to other paediatric vaccines11. bcg has long been employed as an immunotherapeutic agent or adjuvant for preventing recurrence and progression of bladder cancer12. a recent report13 suggests that the potential of bcg in preventing sars-cov-2 infection may be validated among hyper-susceptible population subset such as the front line healthcare personnel and the elderly people. clinical trials to test the efficacy of bcg in boosting the immune system against sars-cov-2, have been initiated in the netherlands (nct04417335), australia (nct04327206) and columbia (nct04362124) (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov). host pattern recognition receptors (prrs), expressed by innate immune cells, interact with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) of viruses and initiate innate immune response against viral pathogens. many of the pamps are common among different species of bacteria and viruses. multiple families of prrs such as nod-like receptors, rig-l-like receptors and toll-like receptors detect viral proteins, which in turn induce interferons and cytokines, aiding in the elimination of the virus. it is tempting to speculate that immune response against bcg may cross-recognize sars-cov-2-associated pamps and confer immunity against this infection. prior immunization with bcg or re-vaccination with bcg in adults can induce ‘trained immunity’ (innate immune memory), a term used to describe the possible mechanism(s) underlying heterologous protection induced by bcg against non-mycobacterial antigens. the trained immunity is a kind of conditioning of the innate immune cells, mainly monocytes/macrophages/natural killer cells, to undergo specific epigenetic changes (including de-methylation/de-acetylation) in the genes associated with mounting a robust and non-specific immune response14, resulting in a heightened recall response by primed innate immune cells upon a second encounter to the same/different/broad range of unrelated microbial pamps. the degree of immunological response has been correlated with the chromatin accessibility at the genome regions controlling immune response15. regulatory rna species, including long non-coding rnas and micrornas, have also emerged as the regulators of epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells, besides substantial rewiring of host metabolic landscape with a predominant shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis14. in humans, limited documentation exists on the impact of unintended protective effects of bcg against viral infections. bcg-immunized mice exhibited higher resistance to influenza viral infection challenge as compared to the unvaccinated mice16. arts et al17 reported significantly low levels of viraemia in bcg-vaccinated human volunteers challenged with experimental yellow fever virus (attenuated strain), and the bcg-induced protection correlated with increased production of interleukin (il)-1β. consistent with these studies, bcg re-vaccination induced innate and adaptive immune responses in adult tb patients18 also suggest its utility to renew response against mycobacteria and other unrelated pathogens possibly via induction of trained immunity. mtbvac, a live attenuated mtb vaccine strain, provides long-term non-specific immunological effect on innate trained immunity in addition to adaptive immune response19. kleinnijenhuis et al20 have demonstrated that the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β, tumour necrosis factor-α and il-6 remain elevated up to one year post-bcg vaccination and subsequently waned. in line with previous reports showing beneficial non-specific immune potentiating effects of bcg vaccine, one can logically speculate that bcg vaccination (or re-vaccination in countries with universal bcg immunization) may lead to improved clinical outcomes in viral or other respiratory tract infections, including sars-cov-2. a recent ecological study has suggested that countries where bcg is part of the immunization schedule, the extent of mortality and morbidity due to covid-19 is significantly reduced, and may be able to contain the spread of sars-cov-2 better than those countries which did not have bcg vaccination21. the differences in the number of sars-cov-2-infected cases between countries adhering to the universal bcg vaccination policy and those where universal bcg vaccination is not a policy were evaluated, based on the data of covid-19 cases across the globe (https://www.coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) and bcg vaccination status from bcg world atlas database22. it was observed that in countries where bcg was a part of the immunization schedule, covid-19 cases/100,000 population were almost similar to those where bcg was not a part of universal vaccination schedule (figure a). however, the cause-specific death rate/100,000 population was significantly lower in countries having bcg immunization policy, compared to those where a universal bcg vaccination policy did not exist (figure b). this suggests that bcg vaccination-induced non-specific immunity may be associated with the mitigation of disease severity in covid-19-pandemic areas.figure: scatter plot showing differences in the number of confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 infection (a) and cause-specific death rate (b) per 100,000 population between countries having universal bcg vaccination policy (bcg+ countries) and countries that do not have a universal bcg vaccination policy (bcg− countries). the description of the different colour and symbols is as follows: european countries (sky blue square), asian countries (red circle), middle east countries (yellow square), african countries (brown diamond), north american countries (purple upright triangle), south american countries (green inverted triangle) and australia (grey hexagon). the countries represented in the graph are those with >3000 confirmed covid-19 cases, as of july 9, 2020. the significance of the two data sets was tested using unpaired, non-parametric student's t test using graphpad prism software version 6.7 (san diego, ca, usa) and is shown on the top of the plot (ns, non-significant; *** p<0.001).source: http://www.bcgatlas.org; http://www.gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com.we hypothesized that prior bcg vaccination status was associated with the extent of the covid-19 epidemic. because covid-19 cases started or peaked at different time periods and the infection or death rate stabilized differently among various countries, it posed a limitation to the current study. our results, therefore, are a pointer rather than final conclusion about the role of bcg in arresting the covid-19 pandemic. to have a more definitive picture, the association of bcg vaccination with the protection or recovery from the sars-cov-2 infection must be reinforced with the data available at the individual level. a more comprehensive comparison of bcg-vaccinated individuals on the basis of age at the time of vaccination or re-vaccination may provide critical evidence and logical conclusion for ascertaining the use of bcg in the prevention of covid-19. a significant amount of work has been done to engineer bcg to enhance its immune-boosting and protective properties. vpm1002, a genetically engineered bcg, exhibits improved immunogenicity23, has completed phase i clinical trial in germany (nct00749034) and phase ii clinical trial in south africa (nct01479972) and is currently in phase iii clinical trials in india (nct03152903) for assessing the prevalence of tb recurrence in drug-treated individuals. a separate phase iii trial of vpm1002 (nct04387409) has also been initiated to assess healthcare professionals’ absenteeism during the covid-19 pandemic in germany (table). vpm1002 was engineered to survive within the phagosome (unlike bcg), and was equipped with listeriolysin (from listeria) to perforate phagosomal membrane. vpm1002 has also been reported to prevent recurrence of bladder tumours, highlighting its non-specific benefits. another recombinant bcg strain overexpressing sting (stimulator of interferon genes)-agonist has shown significantly augmented pro-inflammatory cytokine response and protective efficacy in mice and guinea pigs challenged with mtb24.table: role of bacille calmette-guerin (bcg), recombinant bcg, attenuated mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtb) or m. indicus pranii (mip) as immunotherapy and possible intervention against covid-19alternatively, immunogenic components of bcg, such as muramyl dipeptide, can also be tested as an adjunct therapy for immune stimulation in those at high-risk to be affected with covid-19. in addition to being broadly protective, safe and immunogenic, bcg is cost-effective, easy to produce in bulk and, therefore, may be suitable in terms of both availability and affordability. however, before exploiting bcg-induced training of innate immune responses against infections by unrelated pathogens, several potentially confounding factors such as host genetic polymorphisms, endemicity to other viral/bacterial infections and route of immunization need to be examined. of particular note is the association of bcg vaccination, with some adverse effects such as formation of abscess and

sars-cov-2 leading to covid-19 pandemic. a <140 nm sized virus has overwhelmed even the most resource-rich, powerful and technologically advanced nations. despite global efforts to contain it, the pandemic continues to persist, accelerate and cause humongous mortality, morbidity and unimaginable economic loss. over 23 million cases in 216 countries/territories and 806,410 deaths have been reported to the world health organization (who)1 as on august 24, 2020. with an estimated loss of us$ 375 billion to the american economy alone every month2, this virus has virtually paralyzed the global economic activities. the ‘new normal’ way of life is being silently accepted. it now appears that pandemics shall always be imminent. these cannot be prevented but perhaps could be responded better only with strategic preparedness and effective implementation of accurate, evidence-based, practical and validated affordable interventions. implementation of efficient public health actions is possible on the foundations of sound scientific knowledge of the characteristics of sars-cov-2. despite extensive research on all aspects of covid-19 pandemic, the world is still struggling with the origin of the virus, public health implications of the mutations in the viral genome, availability of a diagnostic test with better sensitivity and specificity, understanding the immune response to the virus, its pathobiology and clinical spectrum, and availability of safe and efficacious specific antiviral drugs and a vaccine. these unknowns have made it an enigmatic pandemic till now. origin of the virus continues to be a mystery. sars-cov-2 is believed to have originated from an animal reservoir. experimental infections have shown several species of animals that were permissive, while a few were resistant3. however, their role in the ongoing pandemic is not clear. there is a distinct possibility of bats being the natural reservoir and possibly pangolins serving as the intermediate host4. genetically, pangolin-cov is 91.02 per cent identical to sars-cov-2. high similarity between the whole genome sequence of sars-cov-2 and the batcov, ratg13 strain, (90.55%) has been observed4. convincing evidence demonstrating animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of sars-cov-2 is yet awaited. sars-cov-2 virus shows evolutionary divergence similar to other rna viruses5. mutations are a natural unstoppable phenomenon in this virus leading to emergence of several clades with geographical propensity. the role of quasispecies resulting from these mutations remains unclear and needs further elucidation. the claim that d614g mutation in the spike protein of sars-cov-2 can increase its infectivity needs further exploration6. the indian sars-cov-2 viruses could be classified under all the globally known circulating clades i.e. g, o, v, s and l with potential origin mainly from oceania, europe, middle east and south asia regions7. several studies are required to fully unravel the genetic diversity and understand implications for epidemiological studies, control strategies and development of diagnostics and immunoprophylactic agents. the rapid spread of covid-19 in communities across the globe, and resurgence (second waves) suggest the possible role of asymptomatic persons in its transmission. if strong supportive evidence becomes available, it may advocate continued use of masks and the use of other public health measures8. during early phase of covid-19 pandemic, it was presumed to be a non-relapsing disease. new studies suggest possibility of repeated virologically confirmed infections9. confirmation of reactivation or reinfection and their epidemiological importance are awaited. serosurveillance is generally a sensitive tool to determine the extent of infection and immunity in the general population. only a few field-based studies have generated serosurveillance data but with inconclusive inferences. a recent seroprevalence study showed that most of the population of geneva, switzerland, remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of covid-19 in the region10. such studies raise red flags on continuous susceptibility of the population to covid-19 and inability of the virus to produce widespread immunity. it may contribute to a ‘second wave’ of cases. the role of reduced use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in facilitating a second wave as community engagement wanes, requires further investigation11. sars-cov-2 has caused huge mortality among the elderly. in europe, 90 per cent of the deaths occurred in italy, spain and france, 95 per cent of these occurred in elderly above 60 yr, most of whom had at least one underlying comorbidity12. undoubtedly, almost one-third of the population of these three countries is over 65 yr of age, and their mortality is not comparable to similar populations in developing countries namely india. unusual affliction and mortality caused by this virus in different age groups and in different countries making elderly and those with comorbidities highly vulnerable are still being investigated to facilitate development of age-specific validated prevention, prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. as the pandemic is progressing, several extrapulmonary presentations of covid-19 are becoming obvious. these include thrombosis, myocardial and renal damage, injury to gastrointestinal system, liver and central nervous system13. studies are needed to ascertain the extent of spectrum of clinical manifestations to assist in development of specific protocols for clinical diagnosis and case management. children were believed to be least affected by sars-cov-2. the absence of typical respiratory features in young children is being observed frequently14. complications in the form of a multisystem inflammatory syndrome are being increasingly noted. in these children, the virus could not be isolated from the respiratory tract. clinical features pertained to cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems have been reported. the role of oral route in virus transmission in children is becoming a possibility and needs investigations. this is a new dimension of disease epidemiology with uncertain impact on the progression of the pandemic14. four technologies are currently being utilized for laboratory support to covid-1915. these are real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-qpcr) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the detection of viral rna, and lateral flow assays and elisa for both antigen and antibody detection. the gold standard continues to be rt-qpcr. this test is valuable at the early stages of infection, when the individual may not be symptomatic. however, it has limitations of low stability, false negativity and long processing time16. additional research is needed to determine the impact of false-negative rt-qpcr results; since false negativity facilitates continuous transmission of the virus in the community. availability of an ideal gold standard diagnostic test with sensitivity and specificity exceeding 95 per cent remains elusive. among the alternative diagnostic methods artificial intelligence (ai) algorithms integrated with observations on chest computerized tomography (ct) findings and clinical symptoms have the potential to rapidly diagnose covid-1917. this calls for further studies, international validation and improved access to ct infrastructure and ai skills in covid care centres. no new drug has been found to have specific efficacy in treating cases with covid-19. several drugs are being repurposed. remdesivir, favipiravir, lopinavir/ritonavir either alone or in combination with ribavirin, hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, dexamethasone, teicoplanin, ivermectin, interferon and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies have been approved by the regulatory authorities in different countries for prophylactic or emergency therapeutic use18. as per an earlier systematic review, convalescent plasma therapy in covid-19 seems to be safe, clinically effective, and reduces mortality19. in india, even a plasma bank has been established20. nevertheless, making convalescent plasma accessible to all patients is a huge challenge. all viral infections attract comprehensive immune response comprising humoral and cellular components. although several studies have suggested activation of these responses along with excessive inflammatory response (cytokine storm) which culminate in pathological tissue damages in covid-19, yet there is a limited understanding of immune response and the pathways that trigger it21. clinical trials demonstrate immunogenicity and protection for a limited period. the ad5 vectored covid-19 vaccine showed humoral responses against sars-cov-2 that peaked at day 28 post-vaccination in healthy adults, and rapid specific t-cell responses were also noted from day 14 post-vaccination22. the definition of the protective immune mechanism and duration of persistence of protective immunity remain elusive till date. the uncertainty of long-term immune response has potential implications for the efficacy of vaccines. the real impact of vaccines on this pandemic will become evident only once it has been widely in use for a few months in different populations. as of now, vaccine is being considered as the ultimate intervention to contain the pandemic23. the global race to make it available to the world has been accelerated. currently, there are about 165 different candidate vaccines for covid-19 being developed around the world and several of these are in different phases of clinical trials24. the main types of vaccines include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (dna and rna), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles. to date, only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the russian regulatory authorities25. the global community awaits data from phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of its safety and efficacy. three vaccine candidates (inactivated, dna based recombinant and chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine consisting of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector chadox) are currently in early phases of human trials in india26. commercial production of covid-19 vaccine and possible imports are likely to commence by the end of 2020. global procurement and distribution of vaccine to ensure its universal access has been planned by the who, global alliance for vaccines and immunizations (gavi) and coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations27. india has developed a blueprint for efficient deployment of the vaccine, supported by it-based vaccine tracker. immunizing the entire population, prioritizing high risk segments, assuring quality in logistics and undertaking post-vaccination surveillance for adverse effects and impact on disease burden shall be huge challenges for any health system. among the non-specific approaches, bcg vaccine is being incriminated to regulate cytokines secretions for early protection against sars-cov-2. further studies are needed to understand the role of the bcg vaccine28. with a few exceptions, a lockdown was imposed in almost all the countries to promote social distancing and preparing health system capacity to respond to pandemic. in the absence of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the communities assumed critical importance in curtailing viral transmission. community engagement, especially of poor and illiterate is always difficult to ensure29. the covid-19 pandemic has attracted the entire focus and efforts of the health system. usual health services to communities have become restricted because health facilities are overwhelmed with covid-19 patients. people are also apprehensive about visiting health institutions for fear of contracting covid-19. important components of health services that have suffered most include health needs of children, women, elderly with non-communicable diseases and management of other therapies (e.g. cancers, tuberculosis and hiv) and health emergencies30. the pandemic has pushed back progress made under the millennium development goals and is hampering achievement of ambitious un sustainable development goals. it is still not clear as to how the global community will make up for the pandemic-induced setback to its critical operations of major disease elimination programmes such as for tuberculosis30. science has so far answered fewer questions on this pandemic than numerous ones that have emerged. unknowns exceed known. combating the pandemic shall require complete understanding of the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiological and clinical dimensions, and availability of safe and efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic tools especially for vulnerable and high risk populations. answers to these research questions may get us closer to having reliable and affordable pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to address global challenges posed by this powerful, versatile and enigmatic virus, thereby hopefully restoring normalcy in the

protective immune mechanism and duration of persistence of protective immunity remain elusive till date. the uncertainty of long-term immune response has potential implications for the efficacy of vaccines. the real impact of vaccines on this pandemic will become evident only once it has been widely in use for a few months in different populations. as of now, vaccine is being considered as the ultimate intervention to contain the pandemic23. the global race to make it available to the world has been accelerated. currently, there are about 165 different candidate vaccines for covid-19 being developed around the world and several of these are in different phases of clinical trials24. the main types of vaccines include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (dna and rna), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles. to date, only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the russian regulatory authorities25. the global community awaits data from phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of its safety and efficacy. three vaccine candidates (inactivated, dna based recombinant and chadox1 ncov-19 vaccine consisting of the replication-deficient simian adenovirus vector chadox) are currently in early phases of human trials in india26. commercial production of covid-19 vaccine and possible imports are likely to commence by the end of 2020. global procurement and distribution of vaccine to ensure its universal access has been planned by the who, global alliance for vaccines and immunizations (gavi) and coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations27. india has developed a blueprint for efficient deployment of the vaccine, supported by it-based vaccine tracker. immunizing the entire population, prioritizing high risk segments, assuring quality in logistics and undertaking post-vaccination surveillance for adverse effects and impact on disease burden shall be huge challenges for any health system. among the non-specific approaches, bcg vaccine is being incriminated to regulate cytokines secretions for early protection against sars-cov-2. further studies are needed to understand the role of the bcg vaccine28. with a few exceptions, a lockdown was imposed in almost all the countries to promote social distancing and preparing health system capacity to respond to pandemic. in the absence of specific antiviral drugs or vaccines, non-pharmaceutical interventions undertaken by the communities assumed critical importance in curtailing viral transmission. community engagement, especially of poor and illiterate is always difficult to ensure29. the covid-19 pandemic has attracted the entire focus and efforts of the health system. usual health services to communities have become restricted because health facilities are overwhelmed with covid-19 patients. people are also apprehensive about visiting health institutions for fear of contracting covid-19. important components of health services that have suffered most include health needs of children, women, elderly with non-communicable diseases and management of other therapies (e.g. cancers, tuberculosis and hiv) and health emergencies30. the pandemic has pushed back progress made under the millennium development goals and is hampering achievement of ambitious un sustainable development goals. it is still not clear as to how the global community will make up for the pandemic-induced setback to its critical operations of major disease elimination programmes such as for tuberculosis30. science has so far answered fewer questions on this pandemic than numerous ones that have emerged. unknowns exceed known. combating the pandemic shall require complete understanding of the virus, its pathogenesis, epidemiological and clinical dimensions, and availability of safe and efficacious therapeutic and prophylactic tools especially for vulnerable and high risk populations. answers to these research questions may get us closer to having reliable and affordable pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions to address global challenges posed by this powerful, versatile and enigmatic virus, thereby hopefully restoring normalcy in the world."

tb2. ending tb is a daunting task considering the huge burden in india, continued presence of the disease for centuries and slow declines in the incidence and mortality. however, tb is a disease that can be prevented, diagnosed and treated, so it is unacceptable that so many people die of tb. few decades ago, richer countries in western europe, north america, australia and japan have brought down their burden of tb substantially3. in 2021, 10.6 million people in the world developed active tb and 1.6 million died of it, a staggering mortality of 16 per cent4. tb kills more people than any other single infectious agent apart from covid-19 in recent years (2020-2021). india is the highest tb burden country, accounting for 28 per cent of global tb incidence and 33 per cent of deaths4. in 2021,

to end tb globally despite the setback due to the covid-19 pandemic6. it identifies a comprehensive set of interventions to prevent, diagnose and treat tb and identifies the research needs. these globally identified priority actions need to be fast tracked in india because of india’s bold and ambitious target. how fast india can move towards ending tb will depend on continued political commitment, adequate financing and the pace at which innovations can be developed, introduced and scaled up. one of the major challenges is that many people with tb are either not diagnosed or treated, or their diagnosis is delayed. this is an important contributor to tb deaths and ongoing transmission7. several innovations have developed in india to address this challenge. access to diagnostic services has improved through innovative models of engagement with private healthcare sector and expanding the network of sites with rapid molecular tests8. to detect tb early, even at the sub-clinical stage, systematic active case finding campaigns are being implemented and focussed on pre-delineated vulnerable populations and hotspots9. new tools for tb screening and diagnosis have developed in india such as rapid molecular tests (truenat by molbio and mycobacterium tuberculosis pcr test kit by mylab) and artificial intelligence (ai)-aided chest x-ray reads by qure.ai10–12. further research is ongoing on innovations in testing specimen other than sputum for the diagnosis of tb and on faster and easier methods for genome sequencing. mobile diagnostic vans have been designed with onboard ai-enabled ultra-portable hand-held x-rays and rapid molecular tests for community-based tb screening and diagnosis. drones have been piloted to carry the specimen and drugs to the remote areas of the country13. cough detection apps are in advanced stages of research to prompt people to seek care for their cough and to assist health workers to triage people with cough for tb testing14,15. in the area of tb treatment, india was one of the first countries to research and use digital adherence tools, particularly the medication sleeve-based mhealth solution called 99dots16. india is also planning to scale up the short six-month treatment course for drug-resistant tb called bpal containing bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid after conducting a research study in india (unpublished) to compliment international evidence. for prevention, there are several candidate tb vaccines under research with five candidates in phase 3 clinical trials. two of these five candidate vaccines in phase 3 clinical trials are being researched in india – the recombinant bcg vaccine called vpm1002 of serum institute of india and the inactivated mycobacterial vaccine called immuvac (mip) of indian council of medical research and cadila pharmaceuticals17. a new effective vaccine has significant potential for impact as shown by arinaminpathy et al18 in a paper in this issue of the ijmr. while waiting for a new effective vaccine india needs to scale up tb preventive treatment (tpt) using primarily the short 12-dose ‘3hp’ regimen to all eligible contacts, people living with hiv and other population groups at-risk. to address hesitancy of people and care providers to start tpt a ‘test-and-treat’ approach could be considered with tpt offered to people who test positive for tb infection. in this context, india has now developed a new and much improved skin test for tb infection called c-tb or cy-tb test manufactured by serum institute of india19. data are keys to guide the tb response, and in this context, india’s nikshay system which further evolved in recent years is unique in the world in terms of its capabilities for real-time online handling of patient management

programme management, community and home-based care, use of digital tools, testing at scale, contact tracing at scale and the priority given to airborne infection prevention and control are some of the lessons learnt. tb and covid-19 have many similarities, both being airborne and droplet infections affecting primarily the respiratory system. the tb programme infrastructure and human resources contributed to the covid-19 response because of these similarities. considering the huge burden of tb in india and the ambitious vision to end tb by 2025, tb deserves even more urgency than covid-19 in terms of faster research, quick regulatory approvals of new tools and aggressive scale up of interventions. going forward, as the world and india embark on pandemic preparedness and response, india

reduction in impact of measles are ranked amongst the greatest achievements of humankind ever. these triumphs are the outcomes of the availability and concerted use of potent, safe and affordable specific vaccines. in addition, protecting against 20 infectious diseases, the vaccines prevent 2-3 million deaths annually1. apart from natural infections, vaccines are considered as the safest and cost-effective intervention to induce protection against covid-19. will the vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials be able to achieve this critical milestone is not evident as of today. the entire world is looking forward to covid-19 vaccine to bring a rapid end to the pandemic. the unprecedented global quest for covid-19 vaccine is aimed at achieving what other public health interventions have not been able to accomplish till date to vanquish the pandemic. vaccine is being touted as the most potent weapon to induce immunity - adequate in its immunogenicity and safety to cut short the virus transmission. the vaccine is primarily aimed to protect individuals and creating a pool of immune people that comprises 60-70 per cent of entire population23, thus inducing herd immunity. immunology and selection of antigen for covid-19 vaccine sars-cov-2 is a novel virus. the viral determinants that need to be attacked to confer immunity remain undefined. while there are favourable precedents from other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses4, there are apprehensions that vaccination may mimic rapidly declining natural immunity to sars-cov-2. the antigen of choice for covid-19 vaccine has been the sars-cov-2 spike protein, a type 1 protein that is metastable and should have correct folding during the vaccine production and storage before deployment56. the neutralizing antibodies to be generated by natural infection or through vaccination act against the receptor-binding protein component that binds onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and obstructs the entry of the virus into the cell. initial evidence that only receptor-binding protein should be incorporated in the vaccine is being revisited with the knowledge that there are several areas outside receptor binding domain (rbd) that can be the potential targets for neutralizing antibody7. neutralizing antibodies are likely to produce vaccine-induced protection. however, as with some other coronaviruses, the immune response may have short-lasting immunity not exceeding one year8. in most instances, vaccines inducing t-cell response confer protection. t-cell-mediated immune responses through cd4+ and cd8+ provide broad and long-term protection against coronavirus infections. cd4+ t-cells activate b-cells which lead to the production of virus-specific antibody. cd8+ t-cells being cytotoxic, kill cells that have been invaded by the virus. in patients with covid-19, t cytopenia has been observed in circulating cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells91011. sars-cov-2-specific t-cells have been found in asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms. patients suffering from covid-19 had fewer t-cells than healthy controls12. vaccine platforms perhaps never in the history of combating infectious diseases, so many vaccine candidates were in varying stages of development as are for the covid-19 pandemic. several new and diverse technology platforms are in use to expedite vaccine development13. in its description of the global landscape of covid-19 vaccines, the who reports over 163 vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation and 52 in clinical evaluation as of december 2, 202014. broadly, these vaccines can be categorized into five main types. these include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (dna and rna), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles1516 (table i).table i: overview of soon-to-be-available covid-19 vaccineslive attenuated vaccines closely resemble natural infection but have the potential of reverting to pathogenicity and causing disease among young and immunocompromised individuals17. currently, no covid-19 live attenuated vaccine is in clinical trial phase. inactivated vaccines have proven efficacy for several diseases and their productions can be easily scaled up. the modern vaccine manufacturing units provide appropriate biosafe environment for bulk production of inactivated vaccine. one of the indian manufacturers (bharat biotech in collaboration with the icmr-national institute of virology) is currently moving forward with clinical trial for this category of vaccine18. nucleic acid (dna or rna) vaccines have low cost of production in large volumes. once taken up by the cells, these vaccines express the antigens that have been encoded in the nucleic acid. currently, more than 10 platforms are being used to develop nucleic acid vaccines. successful outcome shall herald a new era in vaccine technology, especially in pandemics when vaccines need to be designed, developed and disseminated swiftly1519. many leading global (moderna inc.) and indian companies (zydus cadila) are currently engaged in clinical trials on nucleic acid vaccines20. recombinant protein vaccines have a targeted approach towards a key antigen but warrant correct conformation of the protein15. the university of oxford, in collaboration with private sector, has developed a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector expressing the wild type s protein (chadox1 ncov-19, also known as azd1222)21. clinical trial on this vaccine is ongoing at multiple sites including in india. only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the russian regulatory authorities22. yet, global community awaits data from phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of the safety and efficacy of the russian vaccine. phase 3 clinical trial of russian vaccine (sputnik v) in india is under the approval process of the national regulatory authority23. vaccine developed and manufactured by pfizer has been licensed for use in the united kingdom, united states of america, canada and bahrain24. potential risks associated with vaccines an undetermined risk of covid-19 vaccine causing disease enhancement or an acute autoimmune disease through a t-cell-mediated damage or adverse effect due to antibody is yet to be explored. vaccines for many other diseases including influenza and measles have been associated with such unwanted and damaging events25. such events may be detected through post-marketing surveillance of covid-19 vaccine. it is essential to generate reliable data on long-term safety of vaccines to inspire confidence in communities and their acceptance of vaccines. repurposed vaccines for covid-19 in the absence of the specific immunizing agent, several other vaccines have been under investigation with the hypothesis that these vaccines may modify the response of the immune system of vaccines and enhance cytokine production to provide protection against covid-19. these include bcg26, oral polio vaccine (opv)27 and mmr (measles, mumps, and rubella)28. for bcg vaccine alone, three multicentric randomized controlled trials are ongoing in three different countries29. a measles vaccine trial to evaluate its protection against covid-19 is underway in egypt30, and the usa is assessing the efficacy of opv against sars-cov-231. production and deployment of vaccine the world is estimated to need around 16 billion doses of vaccine in immediate future. it is a huge challenge to meet this global requirement in a short period. fortunately, many national and intercountry agencies are providing substantial financial and technical support to vaccine manufacturers to build up their capacity. development of vaccines is an expensive proposition. a dengue vaccine had cost around us 1.5 billion32. cost of investment in vaccine is miniscule as compared to the losses caused by the pandemic. many countries and organizations are supporting timely development and production of adequate quantities of vaccines and their access across the world. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) is supporting nine covid-19 vaccine candidates33. operation warp speed in the usa34 is supporting six candidate vaccines. great britain has allocated £250 million for development of a covid-19 vaccine and also established a vaccine task force35 to support national development, discovery and approval of vaccines. gavi (global alliance for vaccines and immunization) alliance and bill and melinda gates foundation have provided us 300 million to serum institute of india for producing 200 million doses of covid-19 vaccine, half of which have been earmarked for the low- and the middle-income countries36. to facilitate and improve global access to covid-19 vaccines, the who has hosted a global collaboration – access to covid-19 tools (act) accelerator. it comprises the bill and melinda gates foundation, cepi, foundation for innovative diagnostics (find), gavi alliance. the global fund, unitaid, wellcome trust, the who and the world bank37. within the act accelerator is a vaccine pillar (covax) which is co-led by gavi alliance, cepi, who and many other partners. this covax facility has been set up to work with countries and vaccine manufacturers to develop, manufacture and ensure access to vaccine. the facility provides governments with the opportunity to have access to and benefit from a large portfolio of covid-19 vaccines. the goal of covax is to mobilize and deliver by 2021 at least two billion doses of quality-approved vaccines38. negotiations with vaccine manufacturers for bulk purchase shall result in an affordable cost. it is proposed to distribute these vaccines for priority use by the high-risk populations (viz. healthcare and frontline workers), followed by for vaccinating up to 20 per cent of population as per national priority. additional doses, if available, shall be made accessible to countries based on their needs and disease epidemiology39. challenges development of and access to a vaccine against covid-19 shall be a remarkable milestone but not the panacea to eliminate or contain the pandemic in short period. challenges are numerous (table ii). these are financial, technical, logistical, social and strength of existing health system in developing countries to address the issue of universal mass vaccination, especially with limited experience in managing vaccination of adult population. health authorities will have to decide that with initially limited availability of vaccine which category of people becomes priority population on the basis of risk assessment. they will have to consider the social and political ramifications of such decisions.table ii: challenges in vaccination against covid-19logistics shall be a key consideration with all its complexities in reaching out to the entire population through an efficient deployment of the vaccine with a functional cold chain from production-to-vaccination journey. the clinical trials are conducted in defined adult populations. the vulnerable populations are excluded from these. since covid-19 immunization is targeted for entire global population, it shall require prior evidence of efficacy and safety in several subpopulations, especially the elderly, pregnant women, children below 18 yr of age and those who are immunocompromised or living with co-morbidities. role of vaccine in protecting the elderly with or without co-morbidities (>60 yr of age) and inducing immunity in children in whom this coronavirus has the potential to cause paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome needs to be explored on priority through the generation of unequivocal scientific evidence39. will the national and international regulatory bodies consider the impact of vaccines on these subpopulations which have not been evaluated in clinical trials or the licensure shall be restricted to adult and healthy population only or a universal immunization will be permitted, shall be a challenge for the regulatory bodies. basic technical issues that require unequivocal evidence-based responses include definition of the ideal protection, type and duration of immunity to reduce the disease, associated risk of disease potentiation and superiority of vaccination over the natural infection. the scientific community needs to accelerate efforts to produce evidence-based solutions for these issues. conclusions unprecedented and globally coordinated research and efforts are likely to result in availability of some, if not several, vaccines against covid-19 in the next few months. the challenge would be to ensure their optimal and cost-effective use. despite support from international community, the cost of procurement of vaccine and its deployment for every citizen may be exorbitant for most of the developing countries. while an affordable vaccine is the need of the hour, high production and administration cost should force countries to innovate, prioritize and think out of the box to make the best use of this intervention with the sole objective to immediately eliminate the pandemic. earliest availability of covid-19 vaccine is projected to be late 2020 to mid-2021. however, it may take several months before global demand as well as safety, immunogenicity and efficacy criteria are fully met. this emphasizes the need for strong advocacy and sustained implementation of proven public health preventive strategies including wearing masks, maintaining adequate social distance and isolation of infectious individuals leading to swift containment of outbreaks16.",2021,"2023-07-03

against the receptor-binding protein component that binds onto angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and obstructs the entry of the virus into the cell. initial evidence that only receptor-binding protein should be incorporated in the vaccine is being revisited with the knowledge that there are several areas outside receptor binding domain (rbd) that can be the potential targets for neutralizing antibody7. neutralizing antibodies are likely to produce vaccine-induced protection. however, as with some other coronaviruses, the immune response may have short-lasting immunity not exceeding one year8. in most instances, vaccines inducing t-cell response confer protection. t-cell-mediated immune responses through cd4+ and cd8+ provide broad and long-term protection against coronavirus infections. cd4+ t-cells activate b-cells which lead to the production of virus-specific antibody. cd8+ t-cells being cytotoxic, kill cells that have been invaded by the virus. in patients with covid-19, t cytopenia has been observed in circulating cd4+ and cd8+ t-cells91011. sars-cov-2-specific t-cells have been found in asymptomatic individuals or those with mild symptoms. patients suffering from covid-19 had fewer t-cells than healthy controls12. vaccine platforms perhaps never in the history of combating infectious diseases, so many vaccine candidates were in varying stages of development as are for the covid-19 pandemic. several new and diverse technology platforms are in use to expedite vaccine development13. in its description of the global landscape of covid-19 vaccines, the who reports over 163 vaccines in pre-clinical evaluation and 52 in clinical evaluation as of december 2, 202014. broadly, these vaccines can be categorized into five main types. these include: replicating and non-replicating viral vector-based vaccines, whole virus-based (inactivated or attenuated), nucleic acid-based (dna and rna), recombinant protein, peptide-based vaccines and virus-like particles1516 (table i).table i: overview of soon-to-be-available covid-19 vaccineslive attenuated vaccines closely resemble natural infection but have the potential of reverting to pathogenicity and causing disease among young and immunocompromised individuals17. currently, no covid-19 live attenuated vaccine is in clinical trial phase. inactivated vaccines have proven efficacy for several diseases and their productions can be easily scaled up. the modern vaccine manufacturing units provide appropriate biosafe environment for bulk production of inactivated vaccine. one of the indian manufacturers (bharat biotech in collaboration with the icmr-national institute of virology) is currently moving forward with clinical trial for this category of vaccine18. nucleic acid (dna or rna) vaccines have low cost of production in large volumes. once taken up by the cells, these vaccines express the antigens that have been encoded in the nucleic acid. currently, more than 10 platforms are being used to develop nucleic acid vaccines. successful outcome shall herald a new era in vaccine technology, especially in pandemics when vaccines need to be designed, developed and disseminated swiftly1519. many leading global (moderna inc.) and indian companies (zydus cadila) are currently engaged in clinical trials on nucleic acid vaccines20. recombinant protein vaccines have a targeted approach towards a key antigen but warrant correct conformation of the protein15. the university of oxford, in collaboration with private sector, has developed a chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector expressing the wild type s protein (chadox1 ncov-19, also known as azd1222)21. clinical trial on this vaccine is ongoing at multiple sites including in india. only one adenoviral vector-based vaccine has been approved by the russian regulatory authorities22. yet, global community awaits data from phase 3 clinical trial to assure itself of the safety and efficacy of the russian vaccine. phase 3 clinical trial of russian vaccine (sputnik v) in india is under the approval process of the national regulatory authority23. vaccine developed and manufactured by pfizer has been licensed for use in the united kingdom, united states of america, canada and bahrain24. potential risks associated with vaccines an undetermined risk of covid-19 vaccine causing disease enhancement or an acute autoimmune disease through a t-cell-mediated damage or adverse effect due to antibody is yet to be explored. vaccines for many other diseases including influenza and measles have been associated with such unwanted and damaging events25. such events may be detected through post-marketing surveillance of covid-19 vaccine. it is essential to generate reliable data on long-term safety of vaccines to inspire confidence in communities and their acceptance of vaccines. repurposed vaccines for covid-19 in the absence of the specific immunizing agent, several other vaccines have been under investigation with the hypothesis that these vaccines may modify the response of the immune system of vaccines and enhance cytokine production to provide protection against covid-19. these include bcg26, oral polio vaccine (opv)27 and mmr (measles, mumps, and rubella)28. for bcg vaccine alone, three multicentric randomized controlled trials are ongoing in three different countries29. a measles vaccine trial to evaluate its protection against covid-19 is underway in egypt30, and the usa is assessing the efficacy of opv against sars-cov-231. production and deployment of vaccine the world is estimated to need around 16 billion doses of vaccine in immediate future. it is a huge challenge to meet this global requirement in a short period. fortunately, many national and intercountry agencies are providing substantial financial and technical support to vaccine manufacturers to build up their capacity. development of vaccines is an expensive proposition. a dengue vaccine had cost around us 1.5 billion32. cost of investment in vaccine is miniscule as compared to the losses caused by the pandemic. many countries and organizations are supporting timely development and production of adequate quantities of vaccines and their access across the world. the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (cepi) is supporting nine covid-19 vaccine candidates33. operation warp speed in the usa34 is supporting six candidate vaccines. great britain has allocated £250 million for development of a covid-19 vaccine and also established a vaccine task force35 to support national development, discovery and approval of vaccines. gavi (global alliance for vaccines and immunization) alliance and bill and melinda gates foundation have provided us 300 million to serum institute of india for producing 200 million doses of covid-19 vaccine, half of which have been earmarked for the low- and the middle-income countries36. to facilitate and improve global access to covid-19 vaccines, the who has hosted a global collaboration – access to covid-19 tools (act) accelerator. it comprises the bill and melinda gates foundation, cepi, foundation for innovative diagnostics (find), gavi alliance. the global fund, unitaid, wellcome trust, the who and the world bank37. within the act accelerator is a vaccine pillar (covax) which is co-led by gavi alliance, cepi, who and many other partners. this covax facility has been set up to work with countries and vaccine manufacturers to develop, manufacture and ensure access to vaccine. the facility provides governments with the opportunity to have access to and benefit from a large portfolio of covid-19 vaccines. the goal of covax is to mobilize and deliver by 2021 at least two billion doses of quality-approved vaccines38. negotiations with vaccine manufacturers for bulk purchase shall result in an affordable cost. it is proposed to distribute these vaccines for priority use by the high-risk populations (viz. healthcare and frontline workers), followed by for vaccinating up to 20 per cent of population as per national priority. additional doses, if available, shall be made accessible to countries based on their needs and disease epidemiology39. challenges development of and access to a vaccine against covid-19 shall be a remarkable milestone but not the panacea to eliminate or contain the pandemic in short period. challenges are numerous (table ii). these are financial, technical, logistical, social and strength of existing health system in developing countries to address the issue of universal mass vaccination, especially with limited experience in managing vaccination of adult population. health authorities will have to decide that with initially limited availability of vaccine which category of people becomes priority population on the basis of risk assessment. they will have to consider the social and political ramifications of such decisions.table ii: challenges in vaccination against covid-19logistics shall be a key consideration with all its complexities in reaching out to the entire population through an efficient deployment of the vaccine with a functional cold chain from production-to-vaccination journey. the clinical trials are conducted in defined adult populations. the vulnerable populations are excluded from these. since covid-19 immunization is targeted for entire global population, it shall require prior evidence of efficacy and safety in several subpopulations, especially the elderly, pregnant women, children below 18 yr of age and those who are immunocompromised or living with co-morbidities. role of vaccine in protecting the elderly with or without co-morbidities (>60 yr of age) and inducing immunity in children in whom this coronavirus has the potential to cause paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome needs to be explored on priority through the generation of unequivocal scientific evidence39. will the national and international regulatory bodies consider the impact of vaccines on these subpopulations which have not been evaluated in clinical trials or the licensure shall be restricted to adult and healthy population only or a universal immunization will be permitted, shall be a challenge for the regulatory bodies. basic technical issues that require unequivocal evidence-based responses include definition of the ideal protection, type and duration of immunity to reduce the disease, associated risk of disease potentiation and superiority of vaccination over the natural infection. the scientific community needs to accelerate efforts to produce evidence-based solutions for these issues. conclusions unprecedented and globally coordinated research and efforts are likely to result in availability of some, if not several, vaccines against covid-19 in the next few months. the challenge would be to ensure their optimal and cost-effective use. despite support from international community, the cost of procurement of vaccine and its deployment for every citizen may be exorbitant for most of the developing countries. while an affordable vaccine is the need of the hour, high production and administration cost should force countries to innovate, prioritize and think out of the box to make the best use of this intervention with the sole objective to immediately eliminate the pandemic. earliest availability of covid-19 vaccine is projected to be late 2020 to mid-2021. however, it may take several months before global demand as well as safety, immunogenicity and efficacy criteria are fully met. this emphasizes the need for strong advocacy and sustained implementation of proven public health preventive strategies including wearing masks, maintaining adequate social distance and isolation of infectious individuals leading to swift containment of outbreaks16."

pandemicpatent claimspharmaceutical industryrepurposingoverviewin december 2019, physicians in the chinese city of wuhan were treating patients infected by a novel virus, now known as sars-cov-2. this virus caused a new influenza-like disease termed covid-19. by september 2020, globally more than 27 million people were infected and almost 0.9 million were dead [1]. there was neither an immediate availability of a medical cure to treat the infected nor a vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease. most countries announced lockdowns severely impacting industrial activity and hence, the economy. observing the rapid spread of the virus and the attendant mortality, in march 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic [2].the search for an effective therapeutic agent to treat covid-19 began as early as december 2019. the wuhan university filed a second medical use patent for remdesivir, an antiviral drug that had been patented by gilead sciences, usa in several countries. remdesivir had been approved as an orphan drug by the us fda to treat ebola, which gilead sought to rescind in march 2020 [3]. the efficacy of remdesivir to treat covid-19 had not been established conclusively till august 2020, though the drug has been granted an emergency use authorization by regulatory authorities of some countries. another antiviral drug that has been evaluated against the sars-cov-2 virus is favipiravir [4]. it is established to be effective in mildly symptomatic patients when administered early in the infection. this drug has also been issued an emergency use authorization for the treatment of covid-19 by the regulatory authorities of some countries.currently, the pharmaceutical industry is pursuing the development of a vaccine to prevent the infection. the time required for a new drug to be discovered is about 10–12 years, while the time frame for the development of a new vaccine is even longer. however, an immediate remedy was needed to control the pandemic and to treat patients with severe symptoms, many times also suffering from comorbidities. therefore, the pharmaceutical industry chose to repurpose existing drugs rather than searching for a new one. earlier between february and may 2020 there were around 30 candidate drugs that were being repurposed for treating covid-19 targeting the entry of the virus into human cells, its method of replication or the various effects it causes in the body [5]. to date, no candidate has exhibited the potential to treat the infection. in august 2020, few more new candidates had been identified for repurposing to treat covid-19 [6]. recent literature lists more than 100 small molecules and several other drugs, biological and vaccines being repurposed for treating covid-19 and undergoing clinical trials [7].the route of repurposing is advantageous over the traditional route of drug discovery in terms of cost and time [8]. repurposing is estimated to provide a drug at 60% of the cost incurred for a new drug discovery program, taking 3–4 years, which translates into about a third of the time taken for the usual route. the risk in traditional drug discovery is also reduced substantially since the repurposed drug has already been established to be safe. the drug only needs to satisfy the criterion of efficacy for the new indication through phased clinical trials. therefore, it can be a viable route to provide expressly needed remedies at such times as the current pandemic, and also for treating diseases for which available therapies are unaffordable to patients in developing countries.however, the repurposing route still does not seem to attract the pharmaceutical industry as well as it could have been, due to commercial reasons.reasons for repurposing not being attractivenew chemical or biological molecules are eligible for the strong protection that a product or composition of matter patent offers. further, pharmaceutical innovator organizations build a portfolio around the new drug with patents protecting the process of synthesis, various conventional dosage forms, novel drug delivery systems, pure forms, enantiomers, isomers, crystalline forms, improved dissolution profiles and binding efficiencies to name a few. such first use product patent portfolio is usually difficult to challenge and is well protected from potential infringement. the revenue accrued by virtue of this robust patent protection is necessary to ensure the sustainability of ongoing research and development programs [9].repurposed drugs are eligible for patent protection through use claims or method of treatment claims. the european patent organization (epo) provides protection for second medical use by way of a swiss claim which reads as ‘use of substance x to manufacture a medicament to treat a condition y’. the patent acts of the usa and australia allow protection for second medical use through method claims for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease. however, the patent laws of many countries including india, indonesia and argentina do not allow patent protection for repurposed drugs. also, aligned with the trade-related intellectual property rights (trips), the patent laws of many countries do not provide patent protection for methods of treatment, diagnosis or prophylaxis [10,11]. the aforementioned method and use patents provide a limited and weak scope of protection, are easy to work around and difficult to enforce [12].the drug regulations in the us provide market exclusivity of 3 years for the second indication. europe provides an additional 1 year over the existing 8 years data exclusivity if the new use is invented within those 8 years. however, many countries including india do not have such provisions for repurposed drugs [13–15].the case of pregabalin judged by the supreme court of the uk is an excellent example of poor enforcement of second medical use patents. the verdict also provides adequate evidence in the matter of the challenges faced to detect infringement by the various stakeholders, namely the manufacturer, physician, pharmacist and patient. the court concluded that none of the relevant stakeholders can be infringers, further emphasizing the challenges in the enforcement of such claims. one more significant conclusion drawn by the court was that when a second medical use is proposed, medicaments may need to be prescribed by their brand names, and not by their generic or international nonproprietary names [16]. on the other hand, to increase the affordability of medicines and address public health issues, the indian medical council, the nodal agency to regulate medical practice in india requires that the medical practitioners prescribe medicaments by their generic names, clearly avoiding branding [17]. thus, in such markets, especially where literacy levels are very poor, infringement (and its detection) of the rights of both the innovator and that of the proposer of the second medical use, remain unresolved issues.pharmaceutical innovator organizations are known to pursue research and seek regulatory approvals only for those candidates which are strongly protected through patents [12]. a survey of drugs approved in india between 1991 and 2011 showed that only 5% of the drugs approved were for second indication [18]. in conclusion, a combination of nonexisting or poor intellectual property rights protection, completely absent or short tenure of market/data exclusivity and ineffective mechanisms to detect infringement contribute to making repurposing a commercially unattractive pursuit.proposals for repurposed drugsboth pharmaceutical and legal researchers have attempted to overcome the issues faced in repurposing drugs and suggested different approaches to resolve the various challenges. one proposal is a compensation mechanism through complex calculations for the investments carried out to conduct clinical trials for a second medical use [19]. another proposal relates to the process of discovering new drugs. it is recommended that pharmaceutical organizations should consider exploratory research for second medical use during the clinical trials for the first use itself, resulting in the saving of resources [20]. but there is no evidence of the practical implementation of either proposal. the provision of government funding or public-private partnership schemes has also been proposed by some researchers. another critical initiative has been the sharing of molecular libraries between corporates and research institutions to test molecules for a possible second medical use. such practices are being observed in a few instances, particularly in the us.intellectual property rights related initiatives undertaken during the pandemicin april 2020, prof carlos correa, director – south center had appealed to the director-general of who, secretary-general – united nations and to the united nations high commissioner for human rights that “any commercial interest supported by the possession of intellectual property rights on those technologies must not take precedence over saving lives and upholding human rights to support developing and other countries, as they may need, to make use of article 73(b) of the trips agreement to suspend the enforcement of any intellectual property right (including patents, designs and trade secrets) that may pose an obstacle to the procurement or local manufacturing of the products and devices necessary to protect their populations [21]”.in october 2020, the governments of india and south africa submitted a communication to the world trade organization (wto) titled “waiver from certain provisions of the trips agreement for the prevention, containment and treatment of covid-19”. they sought to bring together the wto members to ensure that the various forms of ip do not cause barriers for affordable access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, research, development, manufacturing and supply of products needed during this pandemic. this was supported by many countries and more than 300 organizations globally, but was objected to by countries such as the usa, uk and many other european countries [22]. the first meeting of the wto members did not result in a consensus on the issue and the next session of the wto is scheduled around mid-december.however, there have been no proposals to amend the patentability criteria or patentable subject matter by way of any international agreements or national statutes.future perspectiveto incentivize pharmaceutical companies to vigorously pursue repurposing, immediately implementable remedies as well as various long-term measures should be undertaken.the issue of infringement of second use patents can be prioritized by proposing amendments to labelling rules in national drug laws. a system to identify products approved for second medical use by overt or covert text, visual or coded symbols can be effected to protect the rights of the innovator as well as that of the proposer of the second medical use. this feature will enable detection of infringement independent of whether the products are marketed under a brand name or as a generic and in the same dose or dosage form.on a mid-term basis, research and development-based pharmaceutical organizations should open their molecule libraries to researchers who want to study them for a possible second medical use. an international repository for new molecules should be actively considered and a deposition process facilitated for obtaining patent protection for new chemical entities. this will ease the availability of molecules for further research.eventually, over a period of time, a review of international treaties and harmonization of patentability criteria to provide a mechanism of protection for such discoveries can be considered. this is very relevant considering that even vaccines and traditional medicines are being repurposed, examples being the bcg vaccine and plants such as neem and ashwagandha for providing immunity against the covid-19 [5].another option that should be debated at an international level is the current model of the drug discovery. with continuous advances made in the field of data sciences, computing, artificial intelligence, testing instrumentation and synthetic processes, such technologies should be actively applied to enhance the efficiency of the process of drug discovery.in conclusion, a multi-pronged approach is required to reap the immense benefits of the repurposing route of drug discovery. this will create an alternate course of drug discovery, leading to affordable access to medicines and immense benefits to patients.financial & competing interests

physicians in the chinese city of wuhan were treating patients infected by a novel virus, now known as sars-cov-2. this virus caused a new influenza-like disease termed covid-19. by september 2020, globally more than 27 million people were infected and almost 0.9 million were dead [1]. there was neither an immediate availability of a medical cure to treat the infected nor a vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease. most countries announced lockdowns severely impacting industrial activity and hence, the economy. observing the rapid spread of the virus and the attendant mortality, in march 2020 the who declared covid-19 a pandemic [2].the search for an effective therapeutic agent to treat covid-19 began as early as december 2019. the wuhan university filed a second medical use patent for remdesivir, an antiviral drug that had been patented by gilead sciences, usa in several countries. remdesivir had been approved as an orphan drug by the us fda to treat ebola, which gilead sought to rescind in march 2020 [3]. the efficacy of remdesivir to treat covid-19 had not been established conclusively till august 2020, though the drug has been granted an emergency use authorization by regulatory authorities of some countries. another antiviral drug that has been evaluated against the sars-cov-2 virus is favipiravir [4]. it is established to be effective in mildly symptomatic patients when administered early in the infection. this drug has also been issued an emergency use authorization for the treatment of covid-19 by the regulatory authorities of some countries.currently, the pharmaceutical industry is pursuing the development of a vaccine to prevent the infection. the time required for a new drug to be discovered is about 10–12 years, while the time frame for the development of a new vaccine is even longer. however, an immediate remedy was needed to control the pandemic and to treat patients with severe symptoms, many times also suffering from comorbidities. therefore, the pharmaceutical industry chose to repurpose existing drugs rather than searching for a new one. earlier between february and may 2020 there were around 30 candidate drugs that were being repurposed for treating covid-19 targeting the entry of the virus into human cells, its method of replication or the various effects it causes in the body [5]. to date, no candidate has exhibited the potential to treat the infection. in august 2020, few more new candidates had been identified for repurposing to treat covid-19 [6]. recent literature lists more than 100 small molecules and several other drugs, biological and vaccines being repurposed for treating covid-19 and undergoing clinical trials [7].the route of repurposing is advantageous over the traditional route of drug discovery in terms of cost and time [8]. repurposing is estimated to provide a drug at 60% of the cost incurred for a new drug discovery program, taking 3–4 years, which translates into about a third of the time taken for the usual route. the risk in traditional drug discovery is also reduced substantially since the repurposed drug has already been established to be safe. the drug only needs to satisfy the criterion of efficacy for the new indication through phased clinical trials. therefore, it can be a viable route to provide expressly needed remedies at such times as the current pandemic, and also for treating diseases for which available therapies are unaffordable to patients in developing countries.however, the repurposing route still does not seem to attract the pharmaceutical industry as well as it could have been, due to commercial reasons.reasons for repurposing not being attractivenew chemical or biological molecules are eligible for the strong protection that a product or composition of matter patent offers. further, pharmaceutical innovator organizations build a portfolio around the new drug with patents protecting the process of synthesis, various conventional dosage forms, novel drug delivery systems, pure forms, enantiomers, isomers, crystalline forms, improved dissolution profiles and binding efficiencies to name a few. such first use product patent portfolio is usually difficult to challenge and is well protected from potential infringement. the revenue accrued by virtue of this robust patent protection is necessary to ensure the sustainability of ongoing research and development programs [9].repurposed drugs are eligible for patent protection through use claims or method of treatment claims. the european patent organization (epo) provides protection for second medical use by way of a swiss claim which reads as ‘use of substance x to manufacture a medicament to treat a condition y’. the patent acts of the usa and australia allow protection for second medical use through method claims for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disease. however, the patent laws of many countries including india, indonesia and argentina do not allow patent protection for repurposed drugs. also, aligned with the trade-related intellectual property rights (trips), the patent laws of many countries do not provide patent protection for methods of treatment, diagnosis or prophylaxis [10,11]. the aforementioned method and use patents provide a limited and weak scope of protection, are easy to work around and difficult to enforce [12].the drug regulations in the us provide market exclusivity of 3 years for the second indication. europe provides an additional 1 year over the existing 8 years data exclusivity if the new use is invented within those 8 years. however, many countries including india do not have such provisions for repurposed drugs [13–15].the case of pregabalin judged by the supreme court of the uk is an excellent example of poor enforcement of second medical use patents. the verdict also provides adequate evidence in the matter of the challenges faced to detect infringement by the various stakeholders, namely the manufacturer, physician, pharmacist and patient. the court concluded that none of the relevant stakeholders can be infringers, further emphasizing the challenges in the enforcement of such claims. one more significant conclusion drawn by the court was that when a second medical use is proposed, medicaments may need to be prescribed by their brand names, and not by their generic or international nonproprietary names [16]. on the other hand, to increase the affordability of medicines and address public health issues, the indian medical council, the nodal agency to regulate medical practice in india requires that the medical practitioners prescribe medicaments by their generic names, clearly avoiding branding [17]. thus, in such markets, especially where literacy levels are very poor, infringement (and its detection) of the rights of both the innovator and that of the proposer of the second medical use, remain unresolved issues.pharmaceutical innovator organizations are known to pursue research and seek regulatory approvals only for those candidates which are strongly protected through patents [12]. a survey of drugs approved in india between 1991 and 2011 showed that only 5% of the drugs approved were for second indication [18]. in conclusion, a combination of nonexisting or poor intellectual property rights protection, completely absent or short tenure of market/data exclusivity and ineffective mechanisms to detect infringement contribute to making repurposing a commercially unattractive pursuit.proposals for repurposed drugsboth pharmaceutical and legal researchers have attempted to overcome the issues faced in repurposing drugs and suggested different approaches to resolve the various challenges. one proposal is a compensation mechanism through complex calculations for the investments carried out to conduct clinical trials for a second medical use [19]. another proposal relates to the process of discovering new drugs. it is recommended that pharmaceutical organizations should consider exploratory research for second medical use during the clinical trials for the first use itself, resulting in the saving of resources [20]. but there is no evidence of the practical implementation of either proposal. the provision of government funding or public-private partnership schemes has also been proposed by some researchers. another critical initiative has been the sharing of molecular libraries between corporates and research institutions to test molecules for a possible second medical use. such practices are being observed in a few instances, particularly in the us.intellectual property rights related initiatives undertaken during the pandemicin april 2020, prof carlos correa, director – south center had appealed to the director-general of who, secretary-general – united nations and to the united nations high commissioner for human rights that “any commercial interest supported by the possession of intellectual property rights on those technologies must not take precedence over saving lives and upholding human rights to support developing and other countries, as they may need, to make use of article 73(b) of the trips agreement to suspend the enforcement of any intellectual property right (including patents, designs and trade secrets) that may pose an obstacle to the procurement or local manufacturing of the products and devices necessary to protect their populations [21]”.in october 2020, the governments of india and south africa submitted a communication to the world trade organization (wto) titled “waiver from certain provisions of the trips agreement for the prevention, containment and treatment of covid-19”. they sought to bring together the wto members to ensure that the various forms of ip do not cause barriers for affordable access to medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, research, development, manufacturing and supply of products needed during this pandemic. this was supported by many countries and more than 300 organizations globally, but was objected to by countries such as the usa, uk and many other european countries [22]. the first meeting of the wto members did not result in a consensus on the issue and the next session of the wto is scheduled around mid-december.however, there have been no proposals to amend the patentability criteria or patentable subject matter by way of any international agreements or national statutes.future perspectiveto incentivize pharmaceutical companies to vigorously pursue repurposing, immediately implementable remedies as well as various long-term measures should be undertaken.the issue of infringement of second use patents can be prioritized by proposing amendments to labelling rules in national drug laws. a system to identify products approved for second medical use by overt or covert text, visual or coded symbols can be effected to protect the rights of the innovator as well as that of the proposer of the second medical use. this feature will enable detection of infringement independent of whether the products are marketed under a brand name or as a generic and in the same dose or dosage form.on a mid-term basis, research and development-based pharmaceutical organizations should open their molecule libraries to researchers who want to study them for a possible second medical use. an international repository for new molecules should be actively considered and a deposition process facilitated for obtaining patent protection for new chemical entities. this will ease the availability of molecules for further research.eventually, over a period of time, a review of international treaties and harmonization of patentability criteria to provide a mechanism of protection for such discoveries can be considered. this is very relevant considering that even vaccines and traditional medicines are being repurposed, examples being the bcg vaccine and plants such as neem and ashwagandha for providing immunity against the covid-19 [5].another option that should be debated at an international level is the current model of the drug discovery. with continuous advances made in the field of data sciences, computing, artificial intelligence, testing instrumentation and synthetic processes, such technologies should be actively applied to enhance the efficiency of the process of drug discovery.in conclusion, a multi-pronged approach is required to reap the immense benefits of the repurposing route of drug discovery. this will create an alternate course of drug discovery, leading to affordable access to medicines and immense benefits to patients.financial & competing interests disclosurethe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement

onfacebooktwitterlinkedinredditemail keywords: covid-19drug deliverymedical devicemrnananoparticlevaccinecovid-19 therapeutic updatea smart device for delivery of covid-19 vaccinesa team from swansea university (swansea, uk) has received a grant to develop a smart microneedle vaccine device that can both deliver vaccine and also assess its efficacy by measuring the body’s inflammatory response [1]. although the research is targeting covid-19, it is envisaged the technology can provide a platform to treat other infectious diseases.intradermal delivery has long been recognized as an effective delivery route for vaccines and other therapeutic agents; sanofi pasteur (paris, france) has us fda approval for a flu vaccine delivered by this route using a prefilled syringe with a microneedle. it is argued that the epidermis can elicit a strong immune response and that injection into this region is less painful than for conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. microneedle arrays such as the one being developed by the team in swansea enable a device to be applied as a patch, with multiple needles increasing the delivery rate of a therapeutic or vaccine. this approach could also allow self-administration of a vaccine that could accelerate the roll out of the vaccine program. however, progress in developing microneedle patches has been slow due to challenges in developing technology and fabrication methods that enable high volume manufacture at low cost. concerns also remain around their safety and efficacy [2].the swansea team claim their device, once developed, would be first smart vaccine device that will both deliver and measure the efficacy of a covid vaccine. they argue that the approach would enable more efficient vaccine trials to conducted and would also allow those vaccinated to know when they have achieved immunity.janssen reports topline efficacy data for its phase iii study for a single-dose covid-19 vaccinejohnson & johnson’s (beerse, belgium) announced topline data for an investigational single-dose covid-19 vaccine being developed by its pharmaceuticals division, janssen pharmaceutical companies (beerse, belgium) [3]. the analysis came from 43,783 participants with a total of 468 symptomatic cases of covid-19 with study end points at 14 and 28 days after vaccination. across all the regions studied, usa, central and south america and in south africa, the vaccine was on average, found to be 85% effective in preventing severe disease. for the vaccinated cohort, onset of protection was observed from day 14 and continued to increase during the study with no cases of severe disease reported after day 49. the safety profile was good, with serious fever occurring in less than 0.2% of those treated. serious adverse events were lower in the treated arm compared with those who received placebo.the vaccine uses a human adenovirus that has been modified to incorporate a gene for making the spike protein of the sars-cov-2 virus. when the adenovirus enters a host cell, the spike protein is created, triggering an immune response that then provides protection again sars-cov-2 virus.the fact that the vaccine achieved a good level of protection with a single injection is seen as a significant advantage over other vaccines approved to date that require two injections several weeks apart to achieve protection.the vaccine candidate utilizes janssen’s proprietary advac® platform, which has already been used develop and manufacture an ebola vaccine regimen that has been approved in europe and is being used in other vaccine developments against zika, rsv, and hiv. to develop the vaccine, janssen entered a collaboration with beth israel deaconess medical center (ma, usa) in march 2020.janssen stated it intends to file for us emergency use authorization in the coming weeks and expects to have product ready for immediate shipment on a not-for-profit basis following authorization.novavax report results for its covid-19 vaccine, nvx-cov2373novavax (md, usa) also announced interim results for a study testing the safety and efficacy of its nvx-cov2373 vaccine against covid-19 [4]. in a study that enrolled more than 15,000 participants between 18 and 84 years of age, 62 covid-19 cases were observed with 56 in the placebo group versus six cases observed in treated group, resulting in an estimated 89.3% vaccine efficacy. importantly, given increasing concern around new variants of the virus that are more transmissive, and which might be resistant to earlier vaccines, it was encouraging that around 50% of the confirmed covid cases in the study involved the uk variant of the virus. this suggests there was good exposure in the study to this variant and that immunization against it was effective. based on this study and other studies running in the usa and mexico, novavax claim that this was the first vaccine study to demonstrate clinical efficacy against the new uk and south africa variants of covid-19.unlike the other covid-19 vaccines approved to date, nvx-cov2373 introduces the spike protein directly into the host rather than replying upon the host’s own cells to create the protein. to do this, the vaccine utilizes the company’s recombinant nanoparticle technology to create an antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein. a proprietary adjuvant is used in the vaccine formulation to enhance the host immune response after injection.based on these results, novavax announced that it has started a rolling submission to the the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), the uk’s regulatory authority for medicines approvals.lilly reports study results for neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (ly-cov555) that suggest it can reduce risk of covid for care home residents by up to 80%although a lot of the focus on treatments for covid-19 has been on vaccines, there is still a need to identify medicines that can reduce the severity of the disease for those already infected. in many cases, this has involved looking at opportunities for repurposing existing approved drugs, but this month, eli lilly and company (in, usa) announced results of a study to assess the effectiveness of its drug bamlanivimab (ly-cov555) in reducing risk of contracting symptomatic covid-19 among residents and staff of long-term care facilities [5]. the study involved 965 participants who had tested negative, and 132 who has tested positive for sars-cov-2 virus at baseline and were then randomized to receive either 4200 mg of bamlanivimab or placebo. after an 8-week follow-up, there was a significantly lower frequency of symptomatic covid-19 (the primary end point) in the bamlanivimab treatment arm versus in the placebo arm, suggesting that the drug was effective in reducing preventing infection by the virus as well as potentially treating those in the early stages of infection.unlike a vaccine that aims to stimulate the body’s own immune response to a virus, bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that directly targets the virus and aims to neutralize it. as a result, it may be effective in preventing serious disease in those already infected by sars-cov-2 virus, but compared with vaccines it is unlikely to be cost effective in the prevention of the disease. the data outlined in the press release is from a larger study, blaze-2 that aims to enroll around 5000 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug in the treatment of covid-19. the drug was developed in collaboration with canadian biotechnology company abcellera (vancouver, canada) specifically for the treatment of covid-19 and although not approved, is authorized for emergency use by the fda for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 in high-risk patients for as lower dosage form (700 mg), delivered by infusion.acquisitions, licensing deals & other commercial newssanofi to acquire kymabsanofi (paris, france) announced it is to buy kymab (cambridge, uk) for an upfront payment of approximately us1.1 billion with a further 350 million contingent on achievement of specified milestones [6]. kymab is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and in immuno-oncology. its lead compound, ky1005, targets t-cell immune dysregulation in patients with immune-mediated conditions and in a phase iia study in 2020 reported positive results in the treatment moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. other drugs in its pipeline include ky1044, in clinical development for the treatment of cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with anti-pd-l1 therapeutics and ky1043 an immune checkpoint inhibitor in preclinical development, also for the treatment of cancer. it has partnerships with novo nordisk (bagsværd, denmark), sosei heptares (cambridge, uk) and a collaboration with bill & melinda gates foundation (wa, usa) focused on the identification of new vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to a range of infectious diseases.as well as adding ky1005 to its pipeline, the acquisition will also provide sanofi with access to new antibody technologies and research capabilities. it is anticipated that the purchase will conclude during the first half of 2021.gilead & vir biotechnology to collaborate on treatments for chronic hepatitis bgilead sciences, inc. (ca, usa) and vir biotechnology (ca, usa) announced a collaboration to evaluate therapeutic combination treatment approaches that might provide a functional cure for chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) [7]. they plan to initiate a multi-arm phase ii study to investigate combinations of their developmental drugs, selgantolimod, vir-2218 as well as a commercially sourced pd-1 antagonist as a potential treatment pathway for the disease.although current antiviral therapies for hbv can suppress the virus, they rarely achieve complete clearance and thus require continuous treatment. vir-2218 is an investigational drug being developed by vir and currently in phase ii studies in combination with pegylated ifnα-2a, an approved immunomodulatory agent. it is a subcutaneously administered sirna that targets hbv, with the objective of stimulating an effective immune response and direct antiviral activity against hbv. studies have shown that it can reduce levels of hepatitis b surface antigen, a protein associated with hbv. selgantolimod is an investigational drug being developed by gilead that induces cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that activate an antiviral function by multiple immune mediators that can target hbv. it is administered orally. pd-1 antagonists inhibit pd-1 that downregulates t-cell function, thus increasing immune response. they have been approved for cancer treatment, but it has been suggested that they could have a role in the treatment of hbv by reinvigorating dysfunctional t cells that are observed in patients with the chronic disease. the rationale for a combination approach being pursued by gilead and vir is that a curative treatment requires a reduction of the levels of circulating viral proteins together with stimulation of the immune system to generate new t cells that can then bring the infection under control.vir is clinical-stage immunology company focused on the use immunologic approaches to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases including hbv. gilead has a long-established presence in the treatment of hepatitis including vemlidy, a drug approved for the treatment of hbv in europe and the usa.merck acquires mrna contract development & manufacturing organization amptecmerck (darmstadt, germany) announced that it has acquired amptec (hamburg, germany), a contract development and manufacturing organization with capability in mrna technology [8]. although merck is best known as a pharmaceutical company, it has diversified activities in lifesciences and the supply for performance materials including in diagnostics, electronic displays and gene editing. the acquisition of amptec complements its existing capability in the manufacture of lipids that are commonly used as carriers for the delivery of mrna therapies. amptec also has a diagnostics business that focusing the manufacture of rnas and dnas for in vitro diagnostics, which adds to merck’s current activities in the production of raw material for the sector. the value of the acquisition transaction was not disclosed.novartis invests in credence for injectable delivery scale-upcredence medsystems (ca, usa), a developer of drug-delivery systems, announced a strategic investment in the company by novartis (basel, switzerland) [9]. the undisclosed investment will support development and scaling of credence’s innovative drug-delivery systems, focusing initially on its companion® safety syringe system. the syringe system is designed to prevent reuse and incorporates proprietary automated needle retraction technology. an attraction of the system is that compared with a conventual syringes, it does not require any additional user steps to ensure needle safety after use. the novartis investment follows news of a collaboration with schott, a leading provider of primary drug packaging solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, that will see the two companies collaborate to incorporate credence’s safety needle into schott’s pre-fillable syriq® glass and schott toppac® polymer syringes. prefilled syringes are used by pharmaceutical companies to provide ready to use systems for injectable drug delivery, reducing drug preparation and delivery errors. integrated needle safety is increasingly being used to avoid needle stick injuries during and after use in both initial and at-home settings.amneal to acquire substantially all of kashiv specialty pharmaceuticalsamneal pharmaceuticals (nj, usa) announced that it is to acquire 98% of kashiv speciality, a subsidiary of kashiv biosciences (nj, usa) for approximately 70 m upfront plus an additional 8 million in contingent payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones as well as royalties on future sales [10]. the deal gives amneal ownership of four publicly disclosed drug-delivery platforms; a gastric retention technology in the form of a swellable pill, an osmotic oral drug-delivery system that provides delayed drug release and formulation technologies to improve drug solubility and sustained drug release. kashiv speciality has focused on using these technologies to develop new dosage forms of existing genetic drugs using the fda 505 (b) (2) approval route. this allows the new form of the drug to utilize existing safety data from the original innovator product but also improve its performance using new formulation or device technology.regulatory newsviiv healthcare announces fda approval of cabenuvaviiv healthcare (nc, usa), a company majority owned by glaxosmithkline plc (brentford, uk) announced that it had gained fda approval for cabenuva for the treatment of hiv-1 infection in adults [11].the treatment consists of two co-packaged injectable drugs: cabotegravir, which was developed by viiv, and rilpivirine, an approved drug developed by janssen. dosing is monthly rather than the daily treatment for other approved treatments. in pivotal studies for the new drug, 90% of patients preferred it to their existing treatment, presumably driven by the convenience of less frequent dosing even though this requires two injections per month rather than a daily tablet.viiv healthcare is a specialist hiv company established in 2009 by glaxosmithkline and pfizer (ny, usa), with shionogi (osaka, japan) becoming a partner in 2012.updates on clinical researchlyndra therapeutics announces first subjects dosed in phase i clinical trial of once-weekly rosuvastatin extended-release capsule, lyn-047lyndra therapeutics (ma, usa) announced initiation of a phase i study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a once-weekly formulation of rosuvastatin, a drug used to treat dyslipidemia, a disease arising from abnormal levels of cholesterol or lipids in the blood [12]. rosuvastatin, is normally administered as a daily pill, but this can result in poor adherence, which can be at least partially addressed by moving to less frequent dosing.lyndra has been working on an extended-release oral capsule designed to provide consistent drug levels for a week or more. the approach uses extrusion technology to incorporate active drug into polymer rods, which are then assembled into flexible star-shaped structures, or stellates that can then be folded into a conventional pill capsule. once swallowed, the capsule disintegrates in the stomach and the stellate expands. it is then retained in the gut for an extended period during which the drug is released at a constant rate. after a period of time, the structure disintegrates, passes through the lower gi tract and excreted. in the phase i study, to be run in australia, 16 participants will receive a 140 mg capsule (equivalent to seven 20 mg daily capsule) in two administrations 1 week apart.in total, lynda has eight compounds in preclinical or clinical development, in a mixture of partners and owned programs. its lead program, for extended-release risperidone, is in phase ii.glaukos’ glaucoma implant matches eye drops in 24-month analysisglaukos corporation (ca, usa) announced results from 24-month interim analysis of a 36-month study initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of travoprost delivered from it idose® tr sustained-release ocular implant for the treatment of glaucoma [13]. the 154-subject, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, study compared effectiveness of two different travoprost release rates from the implant to a comparator, timolol applied topically to the eye twice daily. the primary efficacy end point is noninferiority in reduction of intraocular pressure of the implant treatment compared with the eyedrops. topically glaucoma treatments are known to have adherence issues and it is hoped that idose® device can provide an alternative dosage regimen that could result in better outcomes. although the results showed little overall difference between the treated and control groups, around 20% of participants showed average intraocular pressure reductions from baseline of at least 40%, respectively, versus 13% in the timolol control arm suggesting the treatment is more effective than eyedrops for at least some glaucoma patients. the study showed favorable safety for the implant.glaukos corporation is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases.biohaven provides a clinical update on alzheimer’s drugbiohaven (ct, usa) announced disappointing results for a phase ii/iii trial for an investigational drug, troriluzole targeting symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease (ad) [14]. the topline results failed to show any benefit of the drug over placebo measured using cognitive assessments or change in hippocampal volume as assessed by mri. however, analysis of a subgroup including only moderate ad patients, suggested that there might be potential benefit. further analysis will continue, and full results are expected in the coming months and will be presented at a major conference.glutamatergic dysfunction is associated with neurodegeneration as well as with psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. glutamate is an important neurotransmitter but excessive production results in cell stress and death. troriluzole is a prodrug of riluzole, which is fda approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has been tested in clinical trials for several neurodegenerative diseases including parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease and ad. troriluzole reduces side affects associated with riluzole, potentially allowing larger doses to be administered.it was also announced this month that an fda decision on the approval for aducanumab another ad treatment being developed by biogen (ma, usa) and eisai (tokyo, japan) has been delayed by 3 months with prescription drug user fee act action date now 7 june 2021 [15].collaborationsnew collaboration to investigate new treatments for schizophreniathe university of oxford announced a new collaboration a partnership between its department of psychiatry, the earlham institute (norwich, uk), biogen and boehringer ingelheim (ingelheim am rhein, germany) to investigate a new drug target for the treatment of schizophrenia [16]. the collaboration will investigate which proteins are selectively produced by the kalirin gene in the human brain. kalirin is associated with multiple neurological disorders as evidenced by genome sequencing, postmortems and clinical studies. but it has also been shown to create schizophrenia-like symptoms in kalirin knockout mice. the earlham institute, a center of excellence in genomics and computational biology, will lead on the bioinformatic analysis of the publicly available data for schizophrenia as well as the sequencing of protein data generated at the university of oxford. for biogen and boehringer ingelheim, it is hoped that a better understanding of the microbiological processes associated with the disease will enable the development of new and improved treatments for schizophrenia. the project is the first to be funded by the psychiatry consortium, an international £4 million collaboration between several global pharmaceutical companies, and charities, led by the uk’s medicines discovery catapult, that supports high-value drug discovery projects in this area of unmet patient need.science & novel technologiesnanoparticle drug delivery technique shows promise for treating pancreatic cancerresearchers from the kansas city veterans affairs medical center (mo, usa) and north dakota state university (nd, usa) have developed an approach that uses nanoparticle to target the delivery drugs in the treatment pancreatic cancer [17]. treatment by infusion of the drug gemcitabine is the current standard of care, but the drug rapidly degrades in systemic circulation, has toxic side effects, and can suffer from loss of efficacy due to tumor resistance. consequently, the drug offers only a small improvement in patient survival time. extracellular receptor kinase inhibitors (erki) provide another treatment pathway that potentially complements gemcitabine by targeting the erk1/2 activity that gives rise to tumor resistance, but again have limitation due to toxicity, poor solubility and rapid clearance.the current research exploits the fact that ph inside tumor cells is lower than the ph elsewhere in the body, a property that can be used to target therapeutic delivery. ph-responsive nanoparticles were manufactured from polyethylene glycol-containing amphiphilic polycarbonate block copolymers with tertiary amine side chains. these structures are stable at normal in vivo ph but degrade at lower ph enabling release of a drug payload. the approach was tested using nanoparticles loaded with gemcitabine and erki to target cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. it was found that addition of erki significantly increased sensitivity of the cancer cells to gemcitabine and performance was significantly improved to that unencapsulated therapy using the same drug combination.although further work is required before the approach could be taken into clinical testing and commercialization, the researchers believe they have identified a simple, yet efficient approach to target drug delivery for pancreatic cancer as well as potentially for other cancer types. the work was published in molecular pharmaceutics [18].nanoparticle drug-delivery systemnucleic acid-based therapeutics, including sirna have the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson’s disease and ad, but a key challenge is ensuring that these entities can enter the brain safely and efficaciously. disruption of the blood–brain barrier (bbb) after trauma brain injury (tbi) has been used as an approach, but this only provides a limited timeframe for treatment. researchers at brigham and women’s hospital and boston children’s hospital (ma, usa) have developed a new approach that uses nanoparticles to increase the efficiency of transfer and could be uses as the basis of delivery of therapeutic agents on an on-going basis. the team used nanoparticles formed from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or plga, which is biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that has already been approved by the fda for use in several applications. they engineered the surface properties of the nanoparticles to maximize their penetration across the bbb in healthy mice and showed they could encapsulate anti-tau sirna in the nanoparticles and deliver it in therapeutically significant quantities to the brain. tau is expressed after tbi and is also associated with neurodegenerative processes and suppression is seen to be a potential treatment pathway. with this in mind, the team then went on to demonstrate the ability to reduce the expression of tau by 50%, in tbi mice by transfer of anti-tau sirna using the nanoparticles, irrespective of the treatment being administered during or outside the period that the bbb was temporality disrupted by tbi. attempts to deliver the anti-tau sirna across the bbb using a conventional drug-delivery approach failed to show an effect. the researchers are now looking at other targets in addition to tau and believe that their approach should help other teams developing neurodegenerative treatments to test efficacy [19,20].application of quantum computing to drug discoverycambridge quantum computing (cqc; cambridge, uk) and roche (basel, switzerland), announced a collaboration focusing on the use of quantum computing to support early-stage drug discovery and development [21]. quantum computing had been growing in interest over the past 10 years, as it has the potential to dramatically increase computational speed in areas such as modeling and simulation. this benefit comes about because quantum computers perform calculations based on the probability of a state whereas classical computers carry out logical operations using defined states (the 0s and 1s in a binary system). furthermore, the information in each unit in a quantum computer (a qubit) can be influenced by the other qubits in the system which means there is an exponential increase in the information density in the system as the number of qubits are increased. in contract in classical computer there is only a linear increase in information density as the information units (bits) are increased. so, for example, ibm has estimated that modeling a penicillin molecule on a classical computer would take 1086 bits, which is more than the total number of atoms in the observable universe. but the same model on a quantum computer may only require 286 qubits. there are challenges to be overcome; for example, there is a high error rate in a quantum computer, but if this can be addressed then the technology has enormous potential in modeling and simulation. in a recent report [22], bcg (ma, usa), a consulting group, presented a roadmap for the use of quantum computing in drugs discovery starting with computer-aided drug discovery, which uses computing alongside wet chemistry testing to identify targets, through to full in silico drug discovery and design, which is probably 20 years away from being realized. the collaboration between cqc and roche focuses on the application of noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum algorithms for early-stage drug discovery and development, particularly in alzheimer’s disease where it can complement roche's existing efforts in discovering and developing new treatments for the disease.summarythis industry update covers the period from 1 january through to 31 january 2021 and is

covid-19drug deliverymedical devicemrnananoparticlevaccinecovid-19 therapeutic updatea smart device for delivery of covid-19 vaccinesa team from swansea university (swansea, uk) has received a grant to develop a smart microneedle vaccine device that can both deliver vaccine and also assess its efficacy by measuring the body’s inflammatory response [1]. although the research is targeting covid-19, it is envisaged the technology can provide a platform to treat other infectious diseases.intradermal delivery has long been recognized as an effective delivery route for vaccines and other therapeutic agents; sanofi pasteur (paris, france) has us fda approval for a flu vaccine delivered by this route using a prefilled syringe with a microneedle. it is argued that the epidermis can elicit a strong immune response and that injection into this region is less painful than for conventional subcutaneous or intramuscular injections. microneedle arrays such as the one being developed by the team in swansea enable a device to be applied as a patch, with multiple needles increasing the delivery rate of a therapeutic or vaccine. this approach could also allow self-administration of a vaccine that could accelerate the roll out of the vaccine program. however, progress in developing microneedle patches has been slow due to challenges in developing technology and fabrication methods that enable high volume manufacture at low cost. concerns also remain around their safety and efficacy [2].the swansea team claim their device, once developed, would be first smart vaccine device that will both deliver and measure the efficacy of a covid vaccine. they argue that the approach would enable more efficient vaccine trials to conducted and would also allow those vaccinated to know when they have achieved immunity.janssen reports topline efficacy data for its phase iii study for a single-dose covid-19 vaccinejohnson & johnson’s (beerse, belgium) announced topline data for an investigational single-dose covid-19 vaccine being developed by its pharmaceuticals division, janssen pharmaceutical companies (beerse, belgium) [3]. the analysis came from 43,783 participants with a total of 468 symptomatic cases of covid-19 with study end points at 14 and 28 days after vaccination. across all the regions studied, usa, central and south america and in south africa, the vaccine was on average, found to be 85% effective in preventing severe disease. for the vaccinated cohort, onset of protection was observed from day 14 and continued to increase during the study with no cases of severe disease reported after day 49. the safety profile was good, with serious fever occurring in less than 0.2% of those treated. serious adverse events were lower in the treated arm compared with those who received placebo.the vaccine uses a human adenovirus that has been modified to incorporate a gene for making the spike protein of the sars-cov-2 virus. when the adenovirus enters a host cell, the spike protein is created, triggering an immune response that then provides protection again sars-cov-2 virus.the fact that the vaccine achieved a good level of protection with a single injection is seen as a significant advantage over other vaccines approved to date that require two injections several weeks apart to achieve protection.the vaccine candidate utilizes janssen’s proprietary advac® platform, which has already been used develop and manufacture an ebola vaccine regimen that has been approved in europe and is being used in other vaccine developments against zika, rsv, and hiv. to develop the vaccine, janssen entered a collaboration with beth israel deaconess medical center (ma, usa) in march 2020.janssen stated it intends to file for us emergency use authorization in the coming weeks and expects to have product ready for immediate shipment on a not-for-profit basis following authorization.novavax report results for its covid-19 vaccine, nvx-cov2373novavax (md, usa) also announced interim results for a study testing the safety and efficacy of its nvx-cov2373 vaccine against covid-19 [4]. in a study that enrolled more than 15,000 participants between 18 and 84 years of age, 62 covid-19 cases were observed with 56 in the placebo group versus six cases observed in treated group, resulting in an estimated 89.3% vaccine efficacy. importantly, given increasing concern around new variants of the virus that are more transmissive, and which might be resistant to earlier vaccines, it was encouraging that around 50% of the confirmed covid cases in the study involved the uk variant of the virus. this suggests there was good exposure in the study to this variant and that immunization against it was effective. based on this study and other studies running in the usa and mexico, novavax claim that this was the first vaccine study to demonstrate clinical efficacy against the new uk and south africa variants of covid-19.unlike the other covid-19 vaccines approved to date, nvx-cov2373 introduces the spike protein directly into the host rather than replying upon the host’s own cells to create the protein. to do this, the vaccine utilizes the company’s recombinant nanoparticle technology to create an antigen derived from the coronavirus spike protein. a proprietary adjuvant is used in the vaccine formulation to enhance the host immune response after injection.based on these results, novavax announced that it has started a rolling submission to the the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra), the uk’s regulatory authority for medicines approvals.lilly reports study results for neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (ly-cov555) that suggest it can reduce risk of covid for care home residents by up to 80%although a lot of the focus on treatments for covid-19 has been on vaccines, there is still a need to identify medicines that can reduce the severity of the disease for those already infected. in many cases, this has involved looking at opportunities for repurposing existing approved drugs, but this month, eli lilly and company (in, usa) announced results of a study to assess the effectiveness of its drug bamlanivimab (ly-cov555) in reducing risk of contracting symptomatic covid-19 among residents and staff of long-term care facilities [5]. the study involved 965 participants who had tested negative, and 132 who has tested positive for sars-cov-2 virus at baseline and were then randomized to receive either 4200 mg of bamlanivimab or placebo. after an 8-week follow-up, there was a significantly lower frequency of symptomatic covid-19 (the primary end point) in the bamlanivimab treatment arm versus in the placebo arm, suggesting that the drug was effective in reducing preventing infection by the virus as well as potentially treating those in the early stages of infection.unlike a vaccine that aims to stimulate the body’s own immune response to a virus, bamlanivimab is a monoclonal antibody that directly targets the virus and aims to neutralize it. as a result, it may be effective in preventing serious disease in those already infected by sars-cov-2 virus, but compared with vaccines it is unlikely to be cost effective in the prevention of the disease. the data outlined in the press release is from a larger study, blaze-2 that aims to enroll around 5000 patients to assess the efficacy and safety of the drug in the treatment of covid-19. the drug was developed in collaboration with canadian biotechnology company abcellera (vancouver, canada) specifically for the treatment of covid-19 and although not approved, is authorized for emergency use by the fda for the treatment of mild to moderate covid-19 in high-risk patients for as lower dosage form (700 mg), delivered by infusion.acquisitions, licensing deals & other commercial newssanofi to acquire kymabsanofi (paris, france) announced it is to buy kymab (cambridge, uk) for an upfront payment of approximately us1.1 billion with a further 350 million contingent on achievement of specified milestones [6]. kymab is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and in immuno-oncology. its lead compound, ky1005, targets t-cell immune dysregulation in patients with immune-mediated conditions and in a phase iia study in 2020 reported positive results in the treatment moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. other drugs in its pipeline include ky1044, in clinical development for the treatment of cancer either as monotherapy or in combination with anti-pd-l1 therapeutics and ky1043 an immune checkpoint inhibitor in preclinical development, also for the treatment of cancer. it has partnerships with novo nordisk (bagsværd, denmark), sosei heptares (cambridge, uk) and a collaboration with bill & melinda gates foundation (wa, usa) focused on the identification of new vaccines and therapeutic antibodies to a range of infectious diseases.as well as adding ky1005 to its pipeline, the acquisition will also provide sanofi with access to new antibody technologies and research capabilities. it is anticipated that the purchase will conclude during the first half of 2021.gilead & vir biotechnology to collaborate on treatments for chronic hepatitis bgilead sciences, inc. (ca, usa) and vir biotechnology (ca, usa) announced a collaboration to evaluate therapeutic combination treatment approaches that might provide a functional cure for chronic hepatitis b virus (hbv) [7]. they plan to initiate a multi-arm phase ii study to investigate combinations of their developmental drugs, selgantolimod, vir-2218 as well as a commercially sourced pd-1 antagonist as a potential treatment pathway for the disease.although current antiviral therapies for hbv can suppress the virus, they rarely achieve complete clearance and thus require continuous treatment. vir-2218 is an investigational drug being developed by vir and currently in phase ii studies in combination with pegylated ifnα-2a, an approved immunomodulatory agent. it is a subcutaneously administered sirna that targets hbv, with the objective of stimulating an effective immune response and direct antiviral activity against hbv. studies have shown that it can reduce levels of hepatitis b surface antigen, a protein associated with hbv. selgantolimod is an investigational drug being developed by gilead that induces cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that activate an antiviral function by multiple immune mediators that can target hbv. it is administered orally. pd-1 antagonists inhibit pd-1 that downregulates t-cell function, thus increasing immune response. they have been approved for cancer treatment, but it has been suggested that they could have a role in the treatment of hbv by reinvigorating dysfunctional t cells that are observed in patients with the chronic disease. the rationale for a combination approach being pursued by gilead and vir is that a curative treatment requires a reduction of the levels of circulating viral proteins together with stimulation of the immune system to generate new t cells that can then bring the infection under control.vir is clinical-stage immunology company focused on the use immunologic approaches to treat and prevent serious infectious diseases including hbv. gilead has a long-established presence in the treatment of hepatitis including vemlidy, a drug approved for the treatment of hbv in europe and the usa.merck acquires mrna contract development & manufacturing organization amptecmerck (darmstadt, germany) announced that it has acquired amptec (hamburg, germany), a contract development and manufacturing organization with capability in mrna technology [8]. although merck is best known as a pharmaceutical company, it has diversified activities in lifesciences and the supply for performance materials including in diagnostics, electronic displays and gene editing. the acquisition of amptec complements its existing capability in the manufacture of lipids that are commonly used as carriers for the delivery of mrna therapies. amptec also has a diagnostics business that focusing the manufacture of rnas and dnas for in vitro diagnostics, which adds to merck’s current activities in the production of raw material for the sector. the value of the acquisition transaction was not disclosed.novartis invests in credence for injectable delivery scale-upcredence medsystems (ca, usa), a developer of drug-delivery systems, announced a strategic investment in the company by novartis (basel, switzerland) [9]. the undisclosed investment will support development and scaling of credence’s innovative drug-delivery systems, focusing initially on its companion® safety syringe system. the syringe system is designed to prevent reuse and incorporates proprietary automated needle retraction technology. an attraction of the system is that compared with a conventual syringes, it does not require any additional user steps to ensure needle safety after use. the novartis investment follows news of a collaboration with schott, a leading provider of primary drug packaging solutions to the pharmaceutical industry, that will see the two companies collaborate to incorporate credence’s safety needle into schott’s pre-fillable syriq® glass and schott toppac® polymer syringes. prefilled syringes are used by pharmaceutical companies to provide ready to use systems for injectable drug delivery, reducing drug preparation and delivery errors. integrated needle safety is increasingly being used to avoid needle stick injuries during and after use in both initial and at-home settings.amneal to acquire substantially all of kashiv specialty pharmaceuticalsamneal pharmaceuticals (nj, usa) announced that it is to acquire 98% of kashiv speciality, a subsidiary of kashiv biosciences (nj, usa) for approximately 70 m upfront plus an additional 8 million in contingent payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones as well as royalties on future sales [10]. the deal gives amneal ownership of four publicly disclosed drug-delivery platforms; a gastric retention technology in the form of a swellable pill, an osmotic oral drug-delivery system that provides delayed drug release and formulation technologies to improve drug solubility and sustained drug release. kashiv speciality has focused on using these technologies to develop new dosage forms of existing genetic drugs using the fda 505 (b) (2) approval route. this allows the new form of the drug to utilize existing safety data from the original innovator product but also improve its performance using new formulation or device technology.regulatory newsviiv healthcare announces fda approval of cabenuvaviiv healthcare (nc, usa), a company majority owned by glaxosmithkline plc (brentford, uk) announced that it had gained fda approval for cabenuva for the treatment of hiv-1 infection in adults [11].the treatment consists of two co-packaged injectable drugs: cabotegravir, which was developed by viiv, and rilpivirine, an approved drug developed by janssen. dosing is monthly rather than the daily treatment for other approved treatments. in pivotal studies for the new drug, 90% of patients preferred it to their existing treatment, presumably driven by the convenience of less frequent dosing even though this requires two injections per month rather than a daily tablet.viiv healthcare is a specialist hiv company established in 2009 by glaxosmithkline and pfizer (ny, usa), with shionogi (osaka, japan) becoming a partner in 2012.updates on clinical researchlyndra therapeutics announces first subjects dosed in phase i clinical trial of once-weekly rosuvastatin extended-release capsule, lyn-047lyndra therapeutics (ma, usa) announced initiation of a phase i study to evaluate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a once-weekly formulation of rosuvastatin, a drug used to treat dyslipidemia, a disease arising from abnormal levels of cholesterol or lipids in the blood [12]. rosuvastatin, is normally administered as a daily pill, but this can result in poor adherence, which can be at least partially addressed by moving to less frequent dosing.lyndra has been working on an extended-release oral capsule designed to provide consistent drug levels for a week or more. the approach uses extrusion technology to incorporate active drug into polymer rods, which are then assembled into flexible star-shaped structures, or stellates that can then be folded into a conventional pill capsule. once swallowed, the capsule disintegrates in the stomach and the stellate expands. it is then retained in the gut for an extended period during which the drug is released at a constant rate. after a period of time, the structure disintegrates, passes through the lower gi tract and excreted. in the phase i study, to be run in australia, 16 participants will receive a 140 mg capsule (equivalent to seven 20 mg daily capsule) in two administrations 1 week apart.in total, lynda has eight compounds in preclinical or clinical development, in a mixture of partners and owned programs. its lead program, for extended-release risperidone, is in phase ii.glaukos’ glaucoma implant matches eye drops in 24-month analysisglaukos corporation (ca, usa) announced results from 24-month interim analysis of a 36-month study initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of travoprost delivered from it idose® tr sustained-release ocular implant for the treatment of glaucoma [13]. the 154-subject, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, study compared effectiveness of two different travoprost release rates from the implant to a comparator, timolol applied topically to the eye twice daily. the primary efficacy end point is noninferiority in reduction of intraocular pressure of the implant treatment compared with the eyedrops. topically glaucoma treatments are known to have adherence issues and it is hoped that idose® device can provide an alternative dosage regimen that could result in better outcomes. although the results showed little overall difference between the treated and control groups, around 20% of participants showed average intraocular pressure reductions from baseline of at least 40%, respectively, versus 13% in the timolol control arm suggesting the treatment is more effective than eyedrops for at least some glaucoma patients. the study showed favorable safety for the implant.glaukos corporation is an ophthalmic medical technology and pharmaceutical company focused on novel therapies for the treatment of glaucoma, corneal disorders and retinal diseases.biohaven provides a clinical update on alzheimer’s drugbiohaven (ct, usa) announced disappointing results for a phase ii/iii trial for an investigational drug, troriluzole targeting symptomatic treatment of mild-to-moderate alzheimer’s disease (ad) [14]. the topline results failed to show any benefit of the drug over placebo measured using cognitive assessments or change in hippocampal volume as assessed by mri. however, analysis of a subgroup including only moderate ad patients, suggested that there might be potential benefit. further analysis will continue, and full results are expected in the coming months and will be presented at a major conference.glutamatergic dysfunction is associated with neurodegeneration as well as with psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. glutamate is an important neurotransmitter but excessive production results in cell stress and death. troriluzole is a prodrug of riluzole, which is fda approved for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and has been tested in clinical trials for several neurodegenerative diseases including parkinson’s disease, huntington’s disease and ad. troriluzole reduces side affects associated with riluzole, potentially allowing larger doses to be administered.it was also announced this month that an fda decision on the approval for aducanumab another ad treatment being developed by biogen (ma, usa) and eisai (tokyo, japan) has been delayed by 3 months with prescription drug user fee act action date now 7 june 2021 [15].collaborationsnew collaboration to investigate new treatments for schizophreniathe university of oxford announced a new collaboration a partnership between its department of psychiatry, the earlham institute (norwich, uk), biogen and boehringer ingelheim (ingelheim am rhein, germany) to investigate a new drug target for the treatment of schizophrenia [16]. the collaboration will investigate which proteins are selectively produced by the kalirin gene in the human brain. kalirin is associated with multiple neurological disorders as evidenced by genome sequencing, postmortems and clinical studies. but it has also been shown to create schizophrenia-like symptoms in kalirin knockout mice. the earlham institute, a center of excellence in genomics and computational biology, will lead on the bioinformatic analysis of the publicly available data for schizophrenia as well as the sequencing of protein data generated at the university of oxford. for biogen and boehringer ingelheim, it is hoped that a better understanding of the microbiological processes associated with the disease will enable the development of new and improved treatments for schizophrenia. the project is the first to be funded by the psychiatry consortium, an international £4 million collaboration between several global pharmaceutical companies, and charities, led by the uk’s medicines discovery catapult, that supports high-value drug discovery projects in this area of unmet patient need.science & novel technologiesnanoparticle drug delivery technique shows promise for treating pancreatic cancerresearchers from the kansas city veterans affairs medical center (mo, usa) and north dakota state university (nd, usa) have developed an approach that uses nanoparticle to target the delivery drugs in the treatment pancreatic cancer [17]. treatment by infusion of the drug gemcitabine is the current standard of care, but the drug rapidly degrades in systemic circulation, has toxic side effects, and can suffer from loss of efficacy due to tumor resistance. consequently, the drug offers only a small improvement in patient survival time. extracellular receptor kinase inhibitors (erki) provide another treatment pathway that potentially complements gemcitabine by targeting the erk1/2 activity that gives rise to tumor resistance, but again have limitation due to toxicity, poor solubility and rapid clearance.the current research exploits the fact that ph inside tumor cells is lower than the ph elsewhere in the body, a property that can be used to target therapeutic delivery. ph-responsive nanoparticles were manufactured from polyethylene glycol-containing amphiphilic polycarbonate block copolymers with tertiary amine side chains. these structures are stable at normal in vivo ph but degrade at lower ph enabling release of a drug payload. the approach was tested using nanoparticles loaded with gemcitabine and erki to target cancer cells cultured in the laboratory. it was found that addition of erki significantly increased sensitivity of the cancer cells to gemcitabine and performance was significantly improved to that unencapsulated therapy using the same drug combination.although further work is required before the approach could be taken into clinical testing and commercialization, the researchers believe they have identified a simple, yet efficient approach to target drug delivery for pancreatic cancer as well as potentially for other cancer types. the work was published in molecular pharmaceutics [18].nanoparticle drug-delivery systemnucleic acid-based therapeutics, including sirna have the potential to treat neurodegenerative diseases such as parkinson’s disease and ad, but a key challenge is ensuring that these entities can enter the brain safely and efficaciously. disruption of the blood–brain barrier (bbb) after trauma brain injury (tbi) has been used as an approach, but this only provides a limited timeframe for treatment. researchers at brigham and women’s hospital and boston children’s hospital (ma, usa) have developed a new approach that uses nanoparticles to increase the efficiency of transfer and could be uses as the basis of delivery of therapeutic agents on an on-going basis. the team used nanoparticles formed from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), or plga, which is biodegradable and biocompatible polymer that has already been approved by the fda for use in several applications. they engineered the surface properties of the nanoparticles to maximize their penetration across the bbb in healthy mice and showed they could encapsulate anti-tau sirna in the nanoparticles and deliver it in therapeutically significant quantities to the brain. tau is expressed after tbi and is also associated with neurodegenerative processes and suppression is seen to be a potential treatment pathway. with this in mind, the team then went on to demonstrate the ability to reduce the expression of tau by 50%, in tbi mice by transfer of anti-tau sirna using the nanoparticles, irrespective of the treatment being administered during or outside the period that the bbb was temporality disrupted by tbi. attempts to deliver the anti-tau sirna across the bbb using a conventional drug-delivery approach failed to show an effect. the researchers are now looking at other targets in addition to tau and believe that their approach should help other teams developing neurodegenerative treatments to test efficacy [19,20].application of quantum computing to drug discoverycambridge quantum computing (cqc; cambridge, uk) and roche (basel, switzerland), announced a collaboration focusing on the use of quantum computing to support early-stage drug discovery and development [21]. quantum computing had been growing in interest over the past 10 years, as it has the potential to dramatically increase computational speed in areas such as modeling and simulation. this benefit comes about because quantum computers perform calculations based on the probability of a state whereas classical computers carry out logical operations using defined states (the 0s and 1s in a binary system). furthermore, the information in each unit in a quantum computer (a qubit) can be influenced by the other qubits in the system which means there is an exponential increase in the information density in the system as the number of qubits are increased. in contract in classical computer there is only a linear increase in information density as the information units (bits) are increased. so, for example, ibm has estimated that modeling a penicillin molecule on a classical computer would take 1086 bits, which is more than the total number of atoms in the observable universe. but the same model on a quantum computer may only require 286 qubits. there are challenges to be overcome; for example, there is a high error rate in a quantum computer, but if this can be addressed then the technology has enormous potential in modeling and simulation. in a recent report [22], bcg (ma, usa), a consulting group, presented a roadmap for the use of quantum computing in drugs discovery starting with computer-aided drug discovery, which uses computing alongside wet chemistry testing to identify targets, through to full in silico drug discovery and design, which is probably 20 years away from being realized. the collaboration between cqc and roche focuses on the application of noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum algorithms for early-stage drug discovery and development, particularly in alzheimer’s disease where it can complement roche's existing efforts in discovering and developing new treatments for the disease.summarythis industry update covers the period from 1 january through to 31 january 2021 and is

C.; Davis, Joshua S.","australia needs a prioritised national research strategy for clinical trials in a pandemic: lessons learned from covid‐19","The Medical Journal of Australia",NA,"0025-729X","10.5694/mja2.51143","https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.51143","developing a pathway to prioritise clinical research and prepare for future pandemics remains an urgent need the emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), sparking a global pandemic,1 has driven an imperative to quickly design and conduct treatment studies. we strongly propose a national, coordinated approach for randomised controlled trials (rcts) for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), future pandemics and inter-pandemic periods in australia. our reflections represent those of the australasian covid-19 trial (ascot)2 steering committee, as we have considered the challenges of conducting a clinical trial during the covid-19 pandemic in australia. to find effective therapeutic options for covid-19, various approaches to coordination and prioritisation of clinical research have been taken globally. there are more than 3000 relevant rcts now registered.3 among these, the key practice-changing trials have been well coordinated, pragmatic, publicly supported by government, and funded by national research agencies.4 the standout examples are the randomised evaluation of covid-19 therapy (recovery) trial in the united kingdom;5 the “solidarity” clinical trial for covid-19 treatments, run by the world health organization (who);6 the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial (actt) in the united states;7 and the randomised, embedded, multi-factorial, adaptive platform trial for community-acquired pneumonia (remap-cap), which involves participating sites in 21 countries.8 in addition, the prior development of national clinical research networks and infrastructure for improved patient care has strengthened pandemic responsiveness. for example, the uk national institute for health research, with a hospital-based trial infrastructure of clinical research units, was recruiting > 2000 patients per day to rcts before covid-19.9 when covid-19 trials were prioritised in the uk, the existing infrastructure was ready to support pragmatic studies such as recovery and remap-cap. almost 40 000 participants have been randomised in recovery,5 and the uk has been the best recruiting nation globally for remap-cap (with > 4400 of > 6000 participants recruited).8 through an open letter from the uk’s chief medical officers, recovery was prioritised by the uk national health service as the preferred clinical trial at all its hospitals.10 similarly, the solidarity trial has been recommended by the who and implemented in > 30 countries. remap-cap had a global intensive care unit network predating the pandemic, with national health and medical research council (nhmrc) of australia and philanthropic funding, and was rapidly adapted to incorporate therapeutic options for covid-19. the actt and the accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines (activ)11 partnership have been sponsored and funded by the us national institutes of health, with coordination for study sites within and outside the us, leveraging a well established network for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) trials known as the international network for strategic initiatives in global hiv trials.12 minimisation of regulatory requirements, facilitating rapid ethics and governance approvals and swift commencement of clinical trials, meant that these nationally or internationally coordinated trials have quickly evaluated repurposed therapeutic agents for covid-19 for both efficacy and futility. dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality in recovery13 and hydrocortisone was beneficial in critically ill patients in remap-cap;14 remdesivir reduced the time to clinical recovery in patients receiving oxygen with pneumonitis in actt-1;15 and interferon, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir–ritonavir were not beneficial in recovery and the solidarity trial.16-18 more recently, recovery19 and remap-cap20 have conclusively determined the benefit of tociluzimab, after six smaller trials found it to have no benefit. unlike the uk and parts of the us response, there has been little central coordination in australia for the prioritisation and funding of trials. nor was there a nationally resourced and coordinated trials infrastructure in existence before the covid-19 pandemic. the nhmrc did invest in a pandemic preparedness centre of research excellence, which was awarded to the australian partnership for preparedness research on infectious disease emergencies (apprise) in 2016.21 apprise has supported remap-cap and provided seed funding to ascot. the medical research future fund (mrff) has had two calls for clinical trials, in the first round awarding 6.8 million to seven clinical trials,22 which we estimate to have enrolled < 10 patients with covid-19, and subsequently 7.3 million to nine research teams to develop promising antiviral therapies with a pathway to clinical trials. the first mrff round opened for applications on 23 march 2020, with results publicly announced on 2 june 2020, by which time the first wave of covid-19 in australia had receded. over $48 million of mrff funding has now been awarded to 43 projects, of which at least eight are phase 3 clinical trials for covid-19 therapeutics.23 there have been an additional 30 phase 3 clinical trials registered in australia. there are benefits in the distributed approach to clinical trials. competition for funding promotes high quality science. several studies that provide similar results may improve confidence in the findings. smaller studies may be more nimble and lower incidence settings better suited to phase 1 or 2 trials that provide important information to determine whether candidate drugs should progress to larger trials. however, there are also downsides to having multiple competing studies. many research groups duplicate efforts in independently establishing trial infrastructure, including protocols, electronic databases, trial staff and trial committees. there can also be a burden on patients who may be approached about multiple studies. ultimately, there is a substantial risk that each trial will end up underpowered to answer clinically relevant questions. the success of recovery and remap-cap to conduct and complete practice changing trials is instructive. these platform trials have been able to rapidly adapt, incorporate new therapeutic modalities, and answer questions of critical importance. phase 1 or 2 trials are important for progressing the pipeline of potentially effective therapeutics, but in an emerging pandemic, the importance of coordinated investment in definitive phase 3 trials cannot be underestimated. there are some risks in centralising resources into a small number of platforms. poor design or trial conduct in one of these platform trials could be more detrimental compared with spreading this research across a broader number of trials. there may be fewer opportunities for involvement of researchers outside of these platforms. these risks may be mitigated by encouraging coordinated involvement of multiple groups with trials and content expertise, and ensuring there is a mix of early, mid and senior researchers. two critical factors have made it extremely challenging to run therapeutic covid-19 trials in australia. first, the unpredictability of the pandemic, and the small number of patients in australia compared with other countries, has made patient recruitment difficult. second, the swift accrual of patients and communication of results in overseas studies has resulted in the need to rapidly change protocols and drop interventions for which equipoise no longer existed. while these factors were beyond the control of clinical trialists, broader concerns in the australian trial landscape are amenable to change. funding, ethical and governance approval processes for clinical trials in a pandemic need to be in place in advance. by the time funding for covid-19 trials was available through national schemes, the first and second waves had passed. because of the lag time between trial conceptualisation and approval, pre-existing infrastructure is required to enable trials to be operational early in a pandemic. for example, remap-cap had been funded by the nhmrc for > 2 years and operational for severe community-acquired pneumonia in intensive care units. in the absence of nationally coordinated funding, philanthropy has played an important role in quickly supporting trials such as ascot, the bcg vaccination to reduce the impact of covid-19 in healthcare workers (brace) trial,24 and remap-cap. while we have a national mutual acceptance scheme for ethical approval of multicentre clinical trials in australia, the requirement for governance approvals at each individual site creates substantial delays and critical roadblocks. while this would have been most helpful early on, developing a pathway to prioritise clinical research and prepare for future pandemics remains an urgent need. there should be a scientific discussion at a national level to prioritise, support and coordinate a limited number of clinical trials, reducing the burden on patients, health systems and funders. furthermore, we recommend that a national pandemic clinical trials prioritisation panel be formed to advise the nhmrc, mrff, chief health officers and national cabinet. its key role would be to establish a streamlined approach to funding prioritised trial platforms, consider how to integrate applications for new trials with established trial platforms, and establish pathways for rapid ethical and governance approval of protocols in the context of a pandemic and advise on any gaps in research. all authors are members of the ascot steering committee. not

national research strategy for clinical trials in a pandemic: lessons learned from covid‐19 developing a pathway to prioritise clinical research and prepare for future pandemics remains an urgent need the emergence of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2), sparking a global pandemic,1 has driven an imperative to quickly design and conduct treatment studies. we strongly propose a national, coordinated approach for randomised controlled trials (rcts) for coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), future pandemics and inter-pandemic periods in australia. our reflections represent those of the australasian covid-19 trial (ascot)2 steering committee, as we have considered the challenges of conducting a clinical trial during the covid-19 pandemic in australia. to find effective therapeutic options for covid-19, various approaches to coordination and prioritisation of clinical research have been taken globally. there are more than 3000 relevant rcts now registered.3 among these, the key practice-changing trials have been well coordinated, pragmatic, publicly supported by government, and funded by national research agencies.4 the standout examples are the randomised evaluation of covid-19 therapy (recovery) trial in the united kingdom;5 the “solidarity” clinical trial for covid-19 treatments, run by the world health organization (who);6 the adaptive covid-19 treatment trial (actt) in the united states;7 and the randomised, embedded, multi-factorial, adaptive platform trial for community-acquired pneumonia (remap-cap), which involves participating sites in 21 countries.8 in addition, the prior development of national clinical research networks and infrastructure for improved patient care has strengthened pandemic responsiveness. for example, the uk national institute for health research, with a hospital-based trial infrastructure of clinical research units, was recruiting > 2000 patients per day to rcts before covid-19.9 when covid-19 trials were prioritised in the uk, the existing infrastructure was ready to support pragmatic studies such as recovery and remap-cap. almost 40 000 participants have been randomised in recovery,5 and the uk has been the best recruiting nation globally for remap-cap (with > 4400 of > 6000 participants recruited).8 through an open letter from the uk’s chief medical officers, recovery was prioritised by the uk national health service as the preferred clinical trial at all its hospitals.10 similarly, the solidarity trial has been recommended by the who and implemented in > 30 countries. remap-cap had a global intensive care unit network predating the pandemic, with national health and medical research council (nhmrc) of australia and philanthropic funding, and was rapidly adapted to incorporate therapeutic options for covid-19. the actt and the accelerating covid-19 therapeutic interventions and vaccines (activ)11 partnership have been sponsored and funded by the us national institutes of health, with coordination for study sites within and outside the us, leveraging a well established network for human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) trials known as the international network for strategic initiatives in global hiv trials.12 minimisation of regulatory requirements, facilitating rapid ethics and governance approvals and swift commencement of clinical trials, meant that these nationally or internationally coordinated trials have quickly evaluated repurposed therapeutic agents for covid-19 for both efficacy and futility. dexamethasone reduced 28-day mortality in recovery13 and hydrocortisone was beneficial in critically ill patients in remap-cap;14 remdesivir reduced the time to clinical recovery in patients receiving oxygen with pneumonitis in actt-1;15 and interferon, hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir–ritonavir were not beneficial in recovery and the solidarity trial.16-18 more recently, recovery19 and remap-cap20 have conclusively determined the benefit of tociluzimab, after six smaller trials found it to have no benefit. unlike the uk and parts of the us response, there has been little central coordination in australia for the prioritisation and funding of trials. nor was there a nationally resourced and coordinated trials infrastructure in existence before the covid-19 pandemic. the nhmrc did invest in a

currently the major fatal complication of acute leukemia (1). previous studies have indicated a relationship between leukopenia and the presence of infection in patients with acute leukemia (2-4) and various types of agranulocytosis (5-7). chemotherapeutic agents with bone marrow toxicity are being used with increasing frequency in malignant and other chronic diseases. also, a high incidence of infection has accompanied the use of these agents as immunosuppressive therapy in patients receiving organ transplantation (8). the present study examines the quantitative relationships between the presence of infection and the degree and duration of leukopenia in patients with acute leukemia....references1. hershbodeyniesfreireich emgpbaej: the causes of death in acute leukemia. a study of 414

middle east respiratory syndrome-cov, with an ec50 of 10.8 µg/ml; and, only recently, sars-cov-2, with an ec50 of 16.4 µg/ml (2). importantly, the ec50 for hiv-1 is 0.07 µg/ml, more than 200-fold lower than for sars-cov-2 (1). recently, cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with covid-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral loads (3).objective: to measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with covid-19.methods and findings: in this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of covid-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. patients with concomitant intake of relevant cyp3a4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in hiv trials, which makes the data comparable.trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/ml (median, 13.6 µg/ml) (table). interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with c-reactive protein (spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0.81). all patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.table. lopinavir and ritonavir trough concentrations in patients hospitalized with covid-19discussion: we report the first pharmacokinetic data of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with covid-19. lopinavir trough levels were approximately 2-fold higher in our population than in patients with hiv receiving the same dose (7.1 µg/ml) (1). this may have been caused by inflammation-induced downregulation of cytochrome p450 enzyme activity and reduced drug metabolism, which is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (il)-1, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (4). the observed correlation of drug concentrations with c-reactive protein, a downstream marker of il-6, supports this hypothesis and is notable because c-reactive protein levels were not exceedingly high in our population. high levels of il-6 are associated with disease severity (5), and il-6–blocking therapies are being investigated in several clinical trials. thus, drug metabolism may be even more impaired in more severe cases of covid-19. furthermore, clinicians should be aware that anti-inflammatory treatments may severely affect the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome enzyme–dependent drugs.this analysis has limitations. only trough levels were quantified, and more detailed pharmacokinetics were not available. also, there are no data on the half-maximal effective dose of lopinavir for sars-cov-2 in vivo.currently, more than 30 trials of lopinavir and ritonavir treatment of covid-19 are registered, and according to clinicaltrials.gov, doses range from 200 to 400 mg of lopinavir and from 50 to 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily (the patients in our analysis received the latter dose for each drug). unfortunately, lopinavir is almost completely bound by plasma proteins, and only 1% to 2% are free and active (1). to translate drug concentrations in vitro to unbound (and therefore active) concentrations in vivo, a correction for protein binding is required (1, 2). unbound drug concentrations of lopinavir are far from reaching the ec50 of sars-cov-2 (16.4 µg/ml), although they clearly suffice to inhibit hiv-1.in conclusion, despite the approximately 2-fold higher lopinavir trough concentrations in our sample of patients with covid-19 compared with patients with hiv, approximately 60- to 120-fold higher concentrations are required to reach the assumed ec50 at trough levels, making effective treatment of covid-19 with lopinavir and ritonavir at the currently used doses unlikely.references1. croxtall jd, perry cm. lopinavir/ritonavir: a review of its use in the management of hiv-1 infection. drugs. 2010;70:1885-915.

may 2020 lopinavir in covid-19 patients: an examination of lung exposure due to the lack of information on lopinavir exposure in covid-19 patients, total plasma concentrations (i.e. the sum of free and bound lopinavir to plasma proteins) were monitored in many european countries. trough total concentrations (i.e. the value measured on a blood sample collected just before drug administration) are 3 to 4 times higher than the values reported in hiv patients treated with the same dosage regimen (1, 2), suggesting over-exposure in covid-19 patients. these values have prompted clinicians to reduce the dose or even stop treatment. unfortunately, using total concentration as a marker of exposure for highly bound drugs is a well-known pharmacokinetic mistake (3), repeated once again for covid-19 patients. lopinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (>98%), mainly to α1 acid glycoprotein (aag) and to a lesser extent to albumin (1). since aag concentrations are highly elevated during acute inflammation in covid-19 patients, higher bound and total lopinavir exposure are expected while unbound exposure remains unchanged (4). therefore, measuring unbound lopinavir concentrations is critical for drug dosage adjustment. on the other hand, the crucial information remains the drug concentration at the infectious site (i.e. the lung). unfortunately, this information is not available. a lung biopsy would appear to be the most informative approach. however, in such fragile and unstable patients, this option would be highly intrusive. an alternative approach is to evaluate lopinavir concentration in the lung epithelial lining fluid (elf). this information was available for two critically ill covid-19 patients from toulouse university hospital (france) (60 and 64 years old, bmi at 36 and 20, and saps ii at 43 and 38 respectively). they presented severe ards and were intubated. the elf (0.47; 3.88 mg/l) and plasma concentrations (8.86; 7.75 mg/l) were available 15 and 8 days after the treatment initiation, with a ratio of 0.05 and 0.5 respectively. in both cases, elf values were lower than the ec50 (26 µm or 16.3 mg/l) reported for sars-cov-2 (4). even if our data are very sparse, they could help to explain the failure of lopinavir to reduce the sars-cov2 viral load as already discussed (5) and suggest that increasing the lopinavir dose to reach effective lung concentrations is necessary but at the cost of more side effects. 1. boffito m, hoggard p, lindup w. 2004. lopinavir protein binding in vivo through the 12-hour dosing interval. ther drug monit

vienna 3 department of medicine 4, kaiser-franz-josef-hospital,2 june 2020 authors' response we fully agree that (i) protein binding must be taken into account and (ii) drug concentrations at the infectious site (e.g. in the lungs) are more relevant than plasma concentrations, because after all it is where antimicrobial substances have to fight infections. thus, we appreciate that the authors shared their interesting data which confirm the lopinavir plasma concentrations found in our patients (1), but also demonstrating lopinavir concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (elf). these data, support our conclusion that lopinavir concentrations are far from reaching effective concentrations to conquer sars-cov-2. however, elf drug concentrations should only be interpreted with caution, because of well-known methodological issues (2). to interpret any concentrations in elf its concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid has to be calculated. this is mostly done by quantification of urea, because it is a small, non-polar molecule which can diffuse freely across membranes. the concentration of urea is therefore assumed to be equal in plasma and in elf, while the instilled fluid during bal is free of urea (3), so that the dilution may easily be calculated. however, it is important to note that this method is frequently inaccurate, because urea concentrations in bal may be affected by various factors including the “dwelling time”, during which urea may diffuse into the instilled fluid (3). thus, elf volume is frequently overestimated. also drug concentrations may be over-estimated by intracellular drug contents of lysed cells. moreover, the protein concentration in elf needs to be considered, which may vary substantially depending on vascular permeability and the local or systemic inflammatory response (3). total protein concentrations in elf are much lower compared to whole blood, but may increase significantly during inflammation (3, 4) and manifold in pneumonia (5). thus, the degree of protein binding in elf (or lung tissue) is difficult to estimate, but also has to be considered to draw any definitive conclusions. possibly further validation of analytical methods may also be necessary. importantly, the median trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir of 13.6µg/ml, and for that matter also the presented elf drug concentrations, are below the ec50 for sars-cov-2 even without adjustment for protein binding. hence, based on these considerations effective treatment of covid-19 with lopinavir at the currently used doses seems highly unlikely. references: 1. schoergenhofer c, jilma b, stimpfl t, karolyi m, zoufaly a. pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) pandemic has rapidly spread around the world, and the lack of effective treatment has fueled a global search for the “magic bullet” against the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (sars-cov-2). as of 29 april 2020, a total of 997 covid-19 trials were registered at clinicaltrials.gov, of which more than 30 are investigating the effects of lopinavir and ritonavir.lopinavir is the main antiviral agent, whereas ritonavir acts as a pharmacokinetic “booster” that increases lopinavir plasma concentrations by inhibiting cytochrome

the ec50 for hiv-1 is 0.07 µg/ml, more than 200-fold lower than for sars-cov-2 (1). recently, cao and colleagues published negative results of a placebo-controlled trial in patients hospitalized with covid-19 in which lopinavir treatment did not affect mortality, clinical performance, or viral loads (3).objective: to measure trough levels of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients with covid-19.methods and findings: in this series of 8 patients who were admitted to a “normal care” ward because of covid-19, we quantified trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir and ritonavir by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. patients with concomitant intake of relevant cyp3a4 inducers or inhibitors were excluded. patients were hospitalized and received 400 mg of lopinavir and 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily for 3 to 10 days before analysis, which was done in the morning shortly before the next dose. assuming a half-life of 4 to 6 hours for lopinavir, steady-state conditions may be assumed for all patients. analysis of trough levels was chosen because they provide more robust pharmacokinetic information for single time–point assessments and were frequently investigated in hiv trials, which makes the data comparable.trough concentrations of lopinavir ranged from 6.2 to 24.3 µg/ml (median, 13.6 µg/ml) (table). interestingly, in this small sample, trough concentrations seemed to be associated with c-reactive protein (spearman correlation coefficient rs = 0.81). all patients had an unremarkable disease course and were discharged from the normal care ward. specific adverse effects of lopinavir and ritonavir were not observed.table. lopinavir and ritonavir trough concentrations in patients hospitalized with covid-19discussion: we report the first pharmacokinetic data of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with covid-19. lopinavir trough levels were approximately 2-fold higher in our population than in patients with hiv receiving the same dose (7.1 µg/ml) (1). this may have been caused by inflammation-induced downregulation of cytochrome p450 enzyme activity and reduced drug metabolism, which is mediated by proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (il)-1, il-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (4). the observed correlation of drug concentrations with c-reactive protein, a downstream marker of il-6, supports this hypothesis and is notable because c-reactive protein levels were not exceedingly high in our population. high levels of il-6 are associated with disease severity (5), and il-6–blocking therapies are being investigated in several clinical trials. thus, drug metabolism may be even more impaired in more severe cases of covid-19. furthermore, clinicians should be aware that anti-inflammatory treatments may severely affect the pharmacokinetics of cytochrome enzyme–dependent drugs.this analysis has limitations. only trough levels were quantified, and more detailed pharmacokinetics were not available. also, there are no data on the half-maximal effective dose of lopinavir for sars-cov-2 in vivo.currently, more than 30 trials of lopinavir and ritonavir treatment of covid-19 are registered, and according to clinicaltrials.gov, doses range from 200 to 400 mg of lopinavir and from 50 to 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily (the patients in our analysis received the latter dose for each drug). unfortunately, lopinavir is almost completely bound by plasma proteins, and only 1% to 2% are free and active (1). to translate drug concentrations in vitro to unbound (and therefore active) concentrations in vivo, a correction for protein binding is required (1, 2). unbound drug concentrations of lopinavir are far from reaching the ec50 of sars-cov-2 (16.4 µg/ml), although they clearly suffice to inhibit hiv-1.in conclusion, despite the approximately 2-fold higher lopinavir trough concentrations in our sample of patients with covid-19 compared with patients with hiv, approximately 60- to 120-fold higher concentrations are required to reach the assumed ec50 at trough levels, making effective treatment of covid-19 with lopinavir and ritonavir at the currently used doses unlikely.references1. croxtall jd, perry cm. lopinavir/ritonavir: a review of its use in the management of hiv-1 infection. drugs. 2010;70:1885-915.

may 2020 lopinavir in covid-19 patients: an examination of lung exposure due to the lack of information on lopinavir exposure in covid-19 patients, total plasma concentrations (i.e. the sum of free and bound lopinavir to plasma proteins) were monitored in many european countries. trough total concentrations (i.e. the value measured on a blood sample collected just before drug administration) are 3 to 4 times higher than the values reported in hiv patients treated with the same dosage regimen (1, 2), suggesting over-exposure in covid-19 patients. these values have prompted clinicians to reduce the dose or even stop treatment. unfortunately, using total concentration as a marker of exposure for highly bound drugs is a well-known pharmacokinetic mistake (3), repeated once again for covid-19 patients. lopinavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (>98%), mainly to α1 acid glycoprotein (aag) and to a lesser extent to albumin (1). since aag concentrations are highly elevated during acute inflammation in covid-19 patients, higher bound and total lopinavir exposure are expected while unbound exposure remains unchanged (4). therefore, measuring unbound lopinavir concentrations is critical for drug dosage adjustment. on the other hand, the crucial information remains the drug concentration at the infectious site (i.e. the lung). unfortunately, this information is not available. a lung biopsy would appear to be the most informative approach. however, in such fragile and unstable patients, this option would be highly intrusive. an alternative approach is to evaluate lopinavir concentration in the lung epithelial lining fluid (elf). this information was available for two critically ill covid-19 patients from toulouse university hospital (france) (60 and 64 years old, bmi at 36 and 20, and saps ii at 43 and 38 respectively). they presented severe ards and were intubated. the elf (0.47; 3.88 mg/l) and plasma concentrations (8.86; 7.75 mg/l) were available 15 and 8 days after the treatment initiation, with a ratio of 0.05 and 0.5 respectively. in both cases, elf values were lower than the ec50 (26 µm or 16.3 mg/l) reported for sars-cov-2 (4). even if our data are very sparse, they could help to explain the failure of lopinavir to reduce the sars-cov2 viral load as already discussed (5) and suggest that increasing the lopinavir dose to reach effective lung concentrations is necessary but at the cost of more side effects. 1. boffito m, hoggard p, lindup w. 2004. lopinavir protein binding in vivo through the 12-hour dosing interval. ther drug monit

vienna 3 department of medicine 4, kaiser-franz-josef-hospital,2 june 2020 authors' response we fully agree that (i) protein binding must be taken into account and (ii) drug concentrations at the infectious site (e.g. in the lungs) are more relevant than plasma concentrations, because after all it is where antimicrobial substances have to fight infections. thus, we appreciate that the authors shared their interesting data which confirm the lopinavir plasma concentrations found in our patients (1), but also demonstrating lopinavir concentrations in epithelial lining fluid (elf). these data, support our conclusion that lopinavir concentrations are far from reaching effective concentrations to conquer sars-cov-2. however, elf drug concentrations should only be interpreted with caution, because of well-known methodological issues (2). to interpret any concentrations in elf its concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage (bal) fluid has to be calculated. this is mostly done by quantification of urea, because it is a small, non-polar molecule which can diffuse freely across membranes. the concentration of urea is therefore assumed to be equal in plasma and in elf, while the instilled fluid during bal is free of urea (3), so that the dilution may easily be calculated. however, it is important to note that this method is frequently inaccurate, because urea concentrations in bal may be affected by various factors including the “dwelling time”, during which urea may diffuse into the instilled fluid (3). thus, elf volume is frequently overestimated. also drug concentrations may be over-estimated by intracellular drug contents of lysed cells. moreover, the protein concentration in elf needs to be considered, which may vary substantially depending on vascular permeability and the local or systemic inflammatory response (3). total protein concentrations in elf are much lower compared to whole blood, but may increase significantly during inflammation (3, 4) and manifold in pneumonia (5). thus, the degree of protein binding in elf (or lung tissue) is difficult to estimate, but also has to be considered to draw any definitive conclusions. possibly further validation of analytical methods may also be necessary. importantly, the median trough plasma concentrations of lopinavir of 13.6µg/ml, and for that matter also the presented elf drug concentrations, are below the ec50 for sars-cov-2 even without adjustment for protein binding. hence, based on these considerations effective treatment of covid-19 with lopinavir at the currently used doses seems highly unlikely. references: 1. schoergenhofer c, jilma b, stimpfl t, karolyi m, zoufaly a. pharmacokinetics of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with
