Trials from areas with high incidence rates for infectious diseases indicated that the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) induces in addition non-specific immunity against various pathogens and thereby reduces overall mortality more than would have been expected by just protecting from tuberculosis. Although recent trials produced conflicting results, it was suggested that BCG might protect from non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and could be used to bridge the time until a specific vaccine against novel respiratory diseases like COVID-19 is available. Methods: We performed a systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2011 and December 9th, 2022, providing evidence about non-specific effects after BCG vaccination, assessed their potential for bias, and meta-analyzed relevant clinical outcomes. We excluded RCTs investigating vaccination with an additional vaccine unless outcomes from a follow-up period before the second vaccination were reported. Results: Our search identified 16 RCTs including 34,197 participants. Vaccination with BCG caused an estimated 44% decrease in risk for respiratory infections (hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39–0.82) with substantial heterogeneity between trials (I2 = 77%). There was evidence for a protective effect on all-cause mortality of 21% if follow-up was restricted to one year (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64–0.99). We did not find evidence for an effect when we considered longer follow-up (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.75–1.03). Infection-related mortality after BCG vaccination was reduced by 33% (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.46–0.99), mortality for sepsis by 38% (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41–0.93). There was no evidence for a protective effect of BCG vaccination on infections of any origin (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71–1.00), COVID-19 (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.68–1.14), sepsis (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55–1.10) or hospitalization (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91–1.11). Conclusions: According to these results, depending on the setting, vaccination with BCG provides time-limited partial protection against non-tuberculosis respiratory infections and may reduce mortality. These findings underline BCG’s potential (1) in pandemic preparedness against novel pathogens especially in developing countries with established BCG vaccination programs but limited access to specific vaccines; (2) in reducing microbial infections, antimicrobial prescriptions and thus the development of antimicrobial resistance. There is a need for additional RCTs to clarify the circumstances under which BCG’s non-specific protective effects are mediated.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:05","2023-07-03 03:09:05","","121–121","","1","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These mutations lead to various new variants and may alter the pathogenicity, immune escape capacity, and re-infection risk. In addition, it is also evident that a compromised immune system increases the susceptibility and severity of the disease. Therefore, strengthening the immune system is considered to combat Covid. Yoga is an ancient practice used for strengthening the body and mind. There are abundant studies that focus on yoga's benefits for stress management; however, lesser studies observed the effects of yoga on the immune system. Therefore, the present study aims to compile randomized controlled studies on the role of yoga in immunity and COVID-19. Our finding reported moderate evidence for the benefits of yoga in the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). However, lesser shreds of evidence were observed on the effect of yoga on innate and adaptive immunity. Our finding reported a paucity of studies examining the impact of yoga on the immunity of Covid patients. Thus, its efficacy as a potential adjuvant to attenuate Covid-19 infection has yet to be proven. Further extensive studies are recommended to draw the inference on the impact of yoga on Covid-19.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:05","2023-07-03 03:09:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

NVX-CoV2373 primary series demonstrated efficacy rates of 89·7–90·4 % and an acceptable safety profile. This article summarizes safety in adult recipients (aged ≥18 years) of primary series NVX-CoV2373 in four randomized placebo-controlled trials. Methods: All participants who received NVX-CoV2373 primary series or placebo (pre-crossover) were included according to actual received treatment. The safety period was from Day 0 (first vaccination) to unblinding/receipt of EUA-approved/crossover vaccine, end of each study (EOS), or last visit date/cutoff date minus 14 days. The analysis reviewed local and systemic solicited adverse events (AEs) within 7 days after NVX-CoV2373 or placebo; unsolicited AEs from after Dose 1 to 28 days after Dose 2; serious AEs (SAEs), deaths, AEs of special interest, and vaccine-related medically attended AEs from Day 0 through end of follow-up (incidence rate per 100 person-years). Findings: Pooled data from 49,950 participants (NVX-CoV2373, n=30,058; placebo, n=19,892) were included. Solicited reactions after any dose were more frequent in NVX-CoV2373 recipients (local, 76%/systemic, 70%) than placebo recipients (29%/47%), and were mostly of mild-to-moderate severity. Grade 3+ reactions were infrequent, with greater frequency in NVX-CoV2373 recipients (6·28%/11·36%) than placebo recipients (0·48%/3·58%). SAEs and deaths occurred with similarly low frequency in NVX-CoV2373 (0·91% and 0·07%, respectively) and placebo recipients (1·0% and 0·06%). Interpretation: To date, NVX-CoV2373 has displayed an acceptable safety profile in healthy adults.

Most patients tolerate the treatment well, with mild side effects. Systemic complications are extremely rare, occur due to BCG dissemination and are associated with immunocompromised state and urothelial breach. Case presentation: We present a case of a 78-year-old male, a former smoker, with history of non-invasive urothelial carcinoma status post partial resection followed by intravesical BCG therapy. An autopsy was performed due to the sudden nature of his death. Autopsy showed multiple necrotizing granulomas in the brain, atrium, ventricles, lungs, kidneys, and urinary bladder. Stains for acid fast bacilli and fungi were negative. In addition, bilateral lungs showed evidence of bronchopneumonia secondary to cytomegalovirus. Conclusion: Granulomatous myocarditis arising from BCG therapy is extremely rare. Our patient with urothelial cancer treated with BCG developed multi organ granulomas, most likely due to a hypersensitivity reaction to intravesical BCG. Arrhythmia induced by granulomatous myocarditis was the cause of his death. Though there have been few cases of systemic BCG-osis causing fatal sepsis leading to death, a cardiac cause of death is unique.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:06","2023-07-03 03:09:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","Research Square Platform LLC","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-2887560/v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Trials which anticipate recruitment challenges may embed methods such as the QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) to help identify and understand the sources of challenges. Such interventions can help shed light on pandemic-related challenges. This paper reports our experience of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on conducting clinical trials with an embedded QRI, highlighting how the QRI aided in identifying challenges and potential solutions, particularly related to the site set-up and participant recruitment. Main body: We report on 13 UK clinical trials which included a QRI. Information is from QRI data and researchers’ experience and reflections. In most trials, recruitment was lower than even the lowest anticipated rates. The flexibility of the QRI facilitated rapid data collection to understand and document, and in some instances respond to, operational challenges. Challenges were mostly logistical, pandemic-related and beyond the control of the site or central trial teams. Specifically: disrupted and variable site opening timelines —often due to local research and development (R&D) delays— shortages of staff to recruit patients; fewer eligible patients or limited access to patients; and intervention-related factors. Almost all trials were affected by pandemic-related staffing issues including redeployment, prioritisation of COVID-19 care and research, and COVID-19-related staff illness and absence. Trials of elective procedures were particularly impacted by the pandemic, which caused changes to care/recruitment pathways, deprioritisation of services, reduced clinical and surgical capacity and longer waiting lists. Attempted solutions included extra engagement with staff and R&D departments, trial protocol changes (primarily moving online) and seeking additional resourcing. Conclusion: We have highlighted wide-ranging, extensive and consistent pandemic-related challenges faced by UK clinical trials, which the QRI helped to identify and, in some cases, address. Many challenges were insurmountable at individual trials or trials unit level. This overview highlights the need to streamline trial regulatory processes, address staffing crises, improve recognition of NHS research staff and for clearer, more nuanced central guidance on the prioritisation of studies and how to deal with the backlog. Pre-emptively embedding qualitative work and stakeholder consultation into trials with anticipated difficulties, moving some processes online, and flexible trial protocols may improve the resilience of trials in the current challenging context.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:06","2023-07-03 03:09:06","","","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients with advanced age or underlying diseases may experience more severe symptoms and are prone to severe ventilation dysfunction. Reducing pulmonary inflammation and improving clinical symptoms is the focus of current treatment. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) can mitigate inflammation and inhibit edema formation. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of therapeutic LIPUS in improving lung inflammation in hospitalized patients with viral pneumonia. Methods: Sixty eligible participants with clinically confirmed viral pneumonia will be assigned to either (1) intervention group (LIPUS stimulus), (2) control group (null stimulus), or (3) self-control group (LIPUS stimulated areas versus non-stimulated areas). The primary outcome will be the difference in the extent of absorption and dissipation of lung inflammation on computed tomography. Secondary outcomes include changes in lung inflammation on ultrasonography images, pulmonary function, blood gas analysis, fingertip arterial oxygen saturation, serum inflammatory factor levels, the sputum excretion volume, time to the disappearance of pulmonary rales, pneumonia status score, and course of pneumonia. Adverse events will be recorded. Discussion: This study is the first clinical study of the efficacy of therapeutic LIPUS in the treatment of viral pneumonia. Given that the current clinical recovery mainly depends on the body’s self-limiting and conventional symptomatic treatment, LIPUS, as a new therapy method, might be a major advance in the treatment of viral pneumonia.

The benefit of lipid-lowering agents has been controversial in this regard. In this systematic review, we assessed the effect of these medications as adjunctive therapy in COVID-19 by the inclusion of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: We searched four international databases including PubMed, the Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase for RCTs in April 2023. The primary outcome was mortality, while other efficacy indices were considered secondary outcomes. In order to estimate the pooled effect size of the outcomes, considering the odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI), random-effect meta-analyses was conducted. Results: Ten studies involving 2,167 COVID-19 patients using statins, omega-3 fatty acids, fenofibrate, PCSK9 inhibitors, and nicotinamide as intervention compared to control or placebo, were included.

Thus, there is a lack of certainty and consensus regarding its effectiveness. This meta-analysis aims to assess the role of convalescent plasma treatment on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients enrolled in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed database (end-of-search: 29 December 2022) for RCTs on convalescent plasma therapy compared to supportive care\standard of care. Pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with random-effects models. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also performed, in order to address heterogeneity and examine any potential association between the factors that varied, and the outcomes reported. The present meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 34 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Per overall analysis, convalescent plasma treatment was not associated with lower 28-day mortality [RR = 0.98, 95% CI (0.91, 1.06)] or improved 28-day secondary outcomes, such as hospital discharge [RR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.97, 1.03)], ICU-related or score-related outcomes, with effect estimates of RR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.98, 1.05) and RR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.95, 1.17), respectively. However, COVID-19 outpatients treated with convalescent plasma had a 26% less risk of requiring hospital care, when compared to those treated with the standard of care [RR = 0.74, 95% CI (0.56, 0.99)]. Regarding subgroup analyses, COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma had an 8% lower risk of ICU-related disease progression when compared to those treated with the standard of care (with or without placebo or standard plasma infusions) [RR = 0.92, 95% CI (0.85, 0.99)] based on reported outcomes from RCTs carried out in Europe. Finally, convalescent plasma treatment was not associated with improved survival or clinical outcomes in the 14-day subgroup analyses. Conclusions: Outpatients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma had a statistically significantly lower risk of requiring hospital care when compared to those treated with placebo or the standard of care. However, convalescent plasma treatment was not statistically associated with prolonged survival or improved clinical outcomes when compared to placebo or the standard of care, per overall analysis in hospitalized populations. This hints at potential benefits, when used early, to prevent progression to severe disease. Finally, convalescent plasma was significantly associated with better ICU-related outcomes in trials carried out in Europe. Well-designed prospective studies could clarify its potential benefit for specific subpopulations in the post-pandemic era.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:08","2023-07-03 03:09:08","","765–765","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drug repurposing trials have focused on potential antiviral therapies aimed at preventing viral replication, anti-inflammatory agents, antithrombotic agents and immune modulators through a number of adaptive platform trials. Living systematic reviews have also enabled evidence synthesis and network meta-analysis as clinical trial data emerge globally. Sources of data: Recent published literature. Areas of agreement: Corticosteroids and immunomodulators that antagonize the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor have been shown to play a critical role in modulating inflammation and improving clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients. Inhaled budesonide reduces the time to recovery in older patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 managed in the community. Areas of controversy: The clinical benefit of remdesivir remains controversial with conflicting evidence from different trials. Remdesivir led to a reduction in time to clinical recovery in the ACTT-1 trial. However, the World Health Organization SOLIDARITY and DISCOVERY trial did not find a significant benefit on 28-day mortality and clinical recovery. Growing points: Other treatments currently being investigated include antidiabetic drug empagliflozin, antimalarial drug artesunate, tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib, immunomodulatory drug infliximab, antiviral drug favipiravir, antiparasitic drug ivermectin and antidepressant drug fluvoxamine. Areas timely for developing research: The timing of therapeutic interventions based on postulated mechanisms of action and the selection of clinically meaningful primary end points remain important considerations in the design and implementation of COVID-19 therapeutic trials.","2023","2023-07-03 03:09:08","2023-07-03 03:09:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press (OUP) Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We performed a randomized controlled clinical trial at the national COVID-19 containment center in Monastir (Tunisia), from May to August 2020. Simple randomization was done in a 1:1 allocation ratio. We included patients aged more than 18 years who had confirmed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and who remained positive on the 14th day. The intervention group received VDs (200,000 IU/1 ml of cholecalciferol); the control group received a placebo treatment (physiological saline (1 ml)). We measured the recovery delay and the cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Core COVID-19 preventive measures include social distancing, regular hand washing, and wearing face coverings in public places. Understanding links between social cognitive factors relating to beliefs/skills is important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, as this can suggest which factors might be targeted via behaviour change interventions to promote adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviours. In this context, mental imagery exercises—self-directed imagining of an anticipated outcome or processes linked to a defined behaviour/activity—offer a well-evidenced, relatively simple behaviour change intervention. In the mental imagery invention reported in this protocol, individuals will be randomly assigned to one of four separate conditions (outcome imagery, process imagery, outcome and process imagery, control). Methods: The primary objective of this randomized controlled study is to assess the effectiveness of a mental imagery intervention on wearing face coverings, as a defined core COVID-19 preventative behaviour. Participants will consist of UK university students and university employees of any age. Participants will be randomized to complete an ‘outcome imagery’ or a ‘process imagery’ exercise, both exercises (i.e. a combined condition) or neither exercise (i.e. a control condition). A total of 260 individuals will be recruited into the study. Outcomes for all study condition arms will be assessed at baseline (Time 1), immediately post-intervention (Time 2), and at 1-month follow-up (Time 3). Discussion: This trial will contribute toward the currently sparse evidence base concerning behaviour change techniques designed to promote COVID-19 preventative behaviours among UK university students and university employees.

However, up to 40% of the patients, treated with adjuvant BCG therapy, experience failure. As the new methods of treatment after BCG failure ap­pear, there is a need to assess efficacy of this therapy in order to improve appropriate treatment during or before BCG therapy. Aim: To review the latest studies on factors, predicting BCG efficacy, and provide summarized information re­garding treatment outcomes in current practice. Methodology: The search was conducted in MEDLINE (Pubmed) and ScienceDirect databases using predeter­mined keywords: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), fai­lure, intravesical therapy, outcome, response, predicting factors, immunological markers, efficacy. 10 articles pu­blished since 2017 were included in this literature review. Results: Prognostic factors such as the use of antibiotics prior to the therapy, body mass index (BMI), lympho­vascular invasion (LVI), endothelin-1 (ET-1), tumor substaging, CD4/CD8, GATA3/T-bet, CD163/CD68, neu­trophil-to-lymphocyte (NLR) ratios are promising factors for estimating the possible response of BCG therapy be­fore undergoing treatment. Blood eosinophil count and percentage, FISH test following 3 months after first BCG instillation and a Cytokine Panel for Response to Intrave­sical Therapy (CyPRIT) nomogram showed huge poten­tial for predicting BCG outcome during BCG treatment. Conclusion: There are quite many possible clinicopatho­logic, immunological, immunohistochemical and anam­nestical factors that could predict the success of BCG therapy. However, in order to include prognostic fac­tors in treatment guidelines, further studies should be performed to determine which of these factors have the greatest clinical value.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:10","2023-07-03 03:09:10","","170–174","","32","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Sveikatos mokslai Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: More than 500 databases were searched between 1-Nov-2020 and 2-Oct-2021 to identify RCTs that were published after our baseline review. One reviewer extracted data with other reviewers verifying the extracted data for accuracy and completeness. Results: After screening 22,414 records, we included 24 and 21 RCTs in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses, respectively. The most investigated drug classes were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) and anticoagulants, investigated by 10 and 11 studies respectively. In meta-analyses, ACEI/ARBs did not affect hospitalization length (mean difference/MD -0.42, 95% CI -1.83; 0.98 days, n=1183), COVID-19 severity (risk ratio/RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71; 1.15, n=1661) and mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.58; 1.47, n=1646).

Other investigated drug classes were antiplatelets (aspirin, 2 trials), antithrombotics (sulodexide, 1 trial), calcium channel blockers (amlodipine, 1 trial) and lipid modifying drugs (atorvastatin, 1 trial). Conclusion: Moderate- to high-certainty RCT evidence suggests that cardiovascular drugs such as ACEIs/ARBs are not associated with poor COVID-19 outcomes, and should therefore not be discontinued. These cardiovascular drugs should also not be initiated to treat or prevent COVID-19 unless they are needed for an underlying currently approved therapeutic indication.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:11","2023-07-03 03:09:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","Authorea, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.22541/au.164431813.39836023/v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Randomized controlled trials that were published in the English language from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2021 on online-based mindfulness programs for psychological problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in electronic databases. Quality assessment was conducted on the retrieved RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for RCTs. (3) Results: Six RCTs were included in this review. Quality appraisal of included RCTs ranged from 1 for low risk of bias to 5 for high risk of bias. There is evidence from the six RCTs that online-based mindfulness interventions may have favorable effects for reducing the levels of psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress.

Efficacy estimates for these vaccines have been widely communicated to the general public, but are nonetheless challenging to compare because they are based on phase 3 trials that differ in study design, definition of vaccine efficacy and in the handling of cases arising shortly after vaccination. In this work, we investigate the impact of these choices on vaccine efficacy estimates, both theoretically and by re-analyzing the Janssen and Pfizer COVID-19 trial data under a uniform protocol. We moreover study the causal interpretation that can be assigned to per-protocol analyses typically performed in vaccine trials. Finally, we propose alternative estimands to measure the intrinsic vaccine efficacy in settings with delayed immune response.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:12","2023-07-03 03:09:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2022.02.02.22270317","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Contagious isolation causes respiratory, physical, and psychological dysfunction. Therefore, we synthesized and analyzed the effect of rehabilitation on patients with COVID-19 studied abroad. Methods: Randomized controlled trials on the rehabilitation of patients with COVID-19 were searched using four international databases: CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE, and PEDro. For rehabilitation, a protocol including breathing training and physical activity was selected, and usual care or prior values were used for the control group. The quality of randomized controlled trials was assessed using the risk-of-bias tool provided by the Cochrane Library. Analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4, and data were weighted and pooled with a random-effects model. Results: Of the 129 studies identified, 4 were finally selected. A total of 227 patients with COVID-19 were evaluated, and significant improvements were seen in forced expiratory volume in one second (SMD = 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.10-1.40; overall effect [Z = 2.25]) and depression (SMD = 3.46; 95% CI, 1.21-5.71; overall effect [Z = 3.02]), excluding forced vital capacity (SMD = 0.28; 95% CI −0.09 to 0.65; overall effect [Z = 1.48]). Conclusion: Rehabilitation showed improvement in respiratory function through breathing training, but a more effective protocol is required for tele-rehabilitation. In addition, interventions involving physical activity will have a beneficial effect on muscle loss and depression caused by quarantine because of coronavirus infection.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:12","2023-07-03 03:09:12","","13–18","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Korean Academy Of Cardiorespiratory Physical Therapy Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have described “informativeness” as the ability of a trial to guide clinical, policy or research decisions. Little is known about the proportion of initiated trials that inform clinical practice. Methods: We created a cohort of randomized interventional clinical trials in three disease areas (ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and lung cancer), that were initiated between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010 using Results: Our study included 125 clinical trials. The proportion meeting four conditions for informativeness was 26.4% (95% CI 18.9 – 35.0). Sixty-seven percent of participants were enrolled in informative trials. The proportion of informative trials did not differ significantly between our three disease areas. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the majority of clinical trials designed to guide clinical practice possess features that may compromise their ability to do so. This highlights opportunities to improve the scientific vetting of clinical research. Funding: This study was funded by the Fonds de recherche Santé Québec postdoctoral research grant (NH).

As the primary cause of mortality is a hyperinflammatory state, the interleukin-6 antagonist tocilizumab has been used in multiple clinical studies. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effectiveness of tocilizumab in reduction of mortality due to COVID-19. A systematic search of the Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to extract randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the use of tocilizumab therapy for COVID-19. An overall pooled mortality analysis was performed, and odds ratios were reported. Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Nine RCTs, including 6489 patients, were selected for meta-analysis. Seven trials reported 28-day mortality, and one trial each reported 21-day and 30-day mortality. There were 846 deaths among 3358 participants in the steroid group while 943 deaths among 3131 patients randomized to the control group (random-effects odds ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.73-1.03, p=0.11). There was some heterogeneity among the trials as the I2 value was 15%, with a p-value of 0.31. There was a reduction in the need for ICU admission in the tocilizumab group. A higher risk of secondary infections was noted in the tocilizumab group (fixed-effects odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.55-0.95, p=0.02). This meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that the use of tocilizumab was not associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 and had higher odds of secondary infections.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:13","2023-07-03 03:09:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: PAGEPress Publications Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in COVID-19 outpatients have tested therapeutic agents, but no RCT or systematic review has been conducted comparing the efficacy of the main outpatient treatment classes to each other. We aimed in this systematic review of outpatient RCTs in COVID-19 to compare hospitalisation rate reductions with four classes of treatment: convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, small molecule antivirals and repurposed drugs. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all COVID-19 outpatient RCTs that included the endpoint of progression to hospitalisation. We assembled, from multiple published and preprint databases, participant characteristics, hospitalisations, resolution of symptoms and mortality from January 2020 to May 21, 2023. The risk of bias from COVID-NMA was incorporated into the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. We measured heterogeneity with I Findings: The search identified 281 studies of which 54 RCTs for 30 diverse interventions were included in the final analysis. These trials, performed largely in unvaccinated cohorts during pre-Omicron waves, focused on populations with at least one COVID-19 hospitalisation risk factor. Grouping by class, monoclonal antibodies (OR=0.31 [95% CI=0.24-0.40]) had highest efficacy, followed by COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) (OR=0.69 [95% CI=0.53 to 0.90]) and small molecule antivirals (OR=0.78 [95% CI=0.48-1.33]) for hospital reduction. Repurposed drugs (OR=0.82 [95% CI-0.72-0.93]) had lower efficacy. Interpretation: Inasmuch as omicron sublineages (XBB and BQ.1.1) are now resistant to monoclonal antibodies, oral antivirals are the preferred treatment in outpatients where available, but intravenous interventions from convalescent plasma to remdesivir are also effective and necessary in constrained medical resource settings or for acute and chronic COVID-19 in the immunocompromised. Funding: US Department of Defense and National Institute of Health Research in context: Added value of this study: This systematic review and meta-analysis brings together trials that assessed hospitalisation rates in diverse COVID-19 outpatient populations varying in age and comorbidities, permitting us to assess the efficacy of interventions both within and across therapeutic classes. While heterogeneity exists within and between these intervention classes, the meta-analysis can be placed in context of trial diverse populations over variant time periods of the pandemic. At present most of the world population has either had COVID-19 or been vaccinated with a high seropositivity rate, indicating that future placebo-controlled trials will be limited because of the sample sizes required to document hospitalisation outcomes. Implications of all the available evidence: Numerous diverse therapeutic tools need to be ready for a resilient response to changing SARS-CoV-2 variants in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised COVID-19 outpatient populations. To date few head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) has compared treatment options for COVID-19 outpatients, making comparisons and treatment choices difficult. This systematic review compares outcomes among RCTs of outpatient therapy for COVID-19, taking into account time between onset of symptoms and treatment administration. We found that small-chemical antivirals, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibodies had comparable efficacy between classes and amongst interventions within the four classes. Monoclonals have lost efficacy with viral mutation, and chemical antivirals have contraindications and adverse events, while intravenous interventions like convalescent plasma or remdesivir remain resilient options for the immunocompromised, and, in the case of CCP, in resource constrained settings with limited availability of oral drugs.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:13","2023-07-03 03:09:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2022.05.24.22275478","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These trials have largely been implemented to address broad public health issues, but with the growing interest in use of real-world data in the regulatory setting, this design may be increasingly considered for industry trials. The key difference between cluster RCTs and traditional RCTs is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) that needs to be considered in cluster RCTs. In this article, we discuss some key practical considerations that are related to ICC in the design, conduct, analysis, and report stages of a cluster RCT.

Three randomized controlled trials were conducted during the spring (Study 1), summer (Study 2), and fall (Study 3) 2020 terms, and were combined into one sample to increase power (N = 775). We evaluated a web-based intervention that focused on increasing present control that had been shown to be effective in several studies prior to the pandemic (e.g., Nguyen-Feng et al., 2017). This intervention was compared to an active comparison condition (psychoeducation about and reminders to engage in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recommended stress management techniques) in Study 1, to a waitlist comparison in Study 2, and to both comparison conditions in Study 3. Participants were undergraduate psychology students at two campuses of a midwestern state university system. Outcomes—perceived stress (primary); depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms (secondary); and boredom (tertiary)—were assessed at pretest and posttest (and 3-week follow-up in Study 3). Differences across conditions were significant for perceived stress, stress symptoms, and boredom (but not depression or anxiety). Contrary to hypotheses, the Present Control and CDC stress management interventions were equally effective. Both were more effective than no intervention (between-group ds = −0.27 and −0.42). Both interventions were more effective for students with higher baseline stress levels. Completion and adherence rates were high for both conditions.

We developed novel approaches to modify in-person visits and complete follow-up during COVID-19. Since these strategies are broadly applicable to circumstances wherein follow-up is difficult, they may help in contingency planning. The objective of this article is to develop and evaluate new approaches to replace detailed, in-person study visits for two trials focused on preventing diabetic foot complications. Methods:: A quasi-experimental pre–post design compared approaches for follow-up during COVID-19 to approaches pre-COVID-19. Study subjects were outpatients at two Veterans Affairs Medical Centers. Following a research “hold,” research resumed in February 2021 for Self-monitoring, Thermometry and Educating Patients for Ulcer Prevention (STEP UP) (n = 241), which focused on preventing recurrent foot ulcers, and in April 2021 for Preventing Amputation by Tailored Risk-based Intervention to Optimize Therapy (PATRIOT) (n = 406), which focused on preventing pre-ulcerative and ulcerative lesions. To complete data collection, we shortened visits, focused on primary and secondary outcomes, and conducted virtual visits when appropriate. For STEP UP, we created a 20-min assessment process that could be administered by phone. Since PATRIOT required plantar photographs to assess foot lesions, we conducted short face-to-face visits. We explored differences and assessed proportion completing visit, visit completion/100 person-months and compared COVID-19 to pre- COVID-19 using unadjusted risk ratios, incidence rate ratios, all with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Finally, we report time-to-visit curves. Results:: In both studies, participants whose follow-up concluded pre- COVID-19 seemed older than those whose follow-up concluded during COVID-19 (PATRIOT: 68.0 (67.2, 68.9) versus 65.2 years (61.9, 68.5); STEP UP: 67.5 (66.2, 68.9) versus 65.3 (63.3, 67.3)). For STEP UP, we completed 91 visits pre- COVID-19 (37.8% (31.6%, 44.2%)) and 63 visits during COVID-19 (78.8% (68.2%, 87.1%)). This was over 1309 person-months pre-COVID-19, and over 208.8 person-months during COVID-19; the visit completion rate/100 person-months were: pre-COVID-19 7.0 (5.6, 8.5), COVID-19 30.2 (23.2, 38.6); risk ratio: 2.1 (1.7, 2.5); and incidence rate ratio 4.3 (3.1, 5.9). Similarly, for PATRIOT, we completed 316 visits pre-COVID-19 (77.8% (73.5%, 81.8%)) and 27 assessments during COVID-19 (84.4% (67.2%, 94.7%)). This was over 1192.7 person-months pre-COVID-19 and 39.3 person-months during COVID-19. The visit completion rate/100 person-months in PATRIOT were: pre-COVID-19 2.7 (2.4, 3.0), COVID-19 6.9 (4.5, 10); risk ratio 1.1 (0.9, 1.3); incidence rate ratio 2.6 (1.8, 3.8). For both studies, the follow-up curves began separating at < 2 months. Conclusions:: We achieved higher completion rates during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 by modifying visits and focusing on primary and secondary outcomes. These strategies prevent excessive missing data, support more valid conclusions, and improve efficiency. They may provide important alternative strategies to achieving higher follow-up in randomized clinical trials.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:14","2023-07-03 03:09:14","","153–165","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Antiplatelet agents have been proposed as candidate drugs for COVID-19 treatment on the basis of their antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties. A systematic review and meta-analysis that included early observational studies and recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to summarize and compare evidence on this issue. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched to identify studies published up to Nov 7, 2021, and the results of registered clinical trials were followed up to Mar 30, 2022. We included RCTs and observational studies assessing the effect of antiplatelet therapy in adult patients with COVID-19. Data on baseline patient characteristics, interventions, controls, and outcomes were extracted by two independent reviewers. The primary outcome was mortality. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Results: Twenty-seven studies were included, of which 23 observational studies were pooled in a meta-analysis, and the remaining four RCTs (ACTIV-4B, RECOVERY, ACTIV-4a, and REMAP-CAP) were narratively synthesized. Based on 23 observational studies of 87,824 COVID-19 patients, antiplatelet treatment favors a lower risk of mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61–0.85; Conclusion: While the rationale for using antiplatelet treatment in COVID-19 patients is compelling and was supported by the combined result of early observational studies, evidence from RCTs did not confirm this approach.

More effective self-management strategies through tele-rehabilitation are suggested to be applied for patients with chronic neck pain to reduce referrals to health cares and disability support through COVID-19. Also, the pain neuroscience education (PNE) approach is an educational method used by health professionals to assist patients in understanding the biology, physiology, and psychosocial factors affecting their pain experience and aligning with the cognitions and beliefs associated with pain and recurrent disability. PNE combined with tele-rehabilitation could be a new solution to encourage patients to manage their condition by themselves and increase the continuity of practice instead of face-to-face sessions. Objective: This randomized control trial (RCT) aims to investigate the effects of PNE with online and face-to-face exercise interventions, and the control group received biomedical education + standardized physical therapy on neck pain and disability, psychological factors, and function in non-traumatic chronic neck pain. Methods/design: Patients with non-traumatic chronic neck pain (patient-centered care and active involvement of patients and the public) will be recruited via flyers displayed in hospitals and universities to participate in an RCT with two experimental and one control group designed to investigate the effects of PNE with online and face-to-face exercise interventions, and the control group received biomedical education + standardized physical therapy on neck pain and disability, psychological factors, and function in non-traumatic chronic neck pain. The outcomes will be measured at baseline, after PNE, and after 3 months of an exercise intervention. All outcomes are presented as mean ± SD, and statistical significance was set at Discussion: It seems that PNE plus online and face-to-face exercise interventions are appropriate educational models for the treatment of patients with neck pain during COVID-19.

To date, there are no effective and approved medications for this disease. Curcumin as an anti-inflammatory agent can have a positive effect on the control of COVID-19 complications. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of curcumin-piperine supplementation on clinical symptoms, duration, severity, and inflammatory factors in patients with COVID-19. Methods: Forty-six outpatients with COVID-19 disease were randomly allocated to receive two capsules of curcumin-piperine; each capsule contained 500 mg curcumin plus 5 mg piperine or placebo for 14 days. Results: Mean changes in complete blood count, liver enzymes, blood glucose levels, lipid parameters, kidney function, and c-reactive protein (CRP) were not significantly different between the two groups.

There is thus an urgent need to test, and an ethical imperative, to test, modify or refine medications or healthcare plans that could reduce patient morbidity, lower healthcare costs or strengthen healthcare systems. Methods: Conceptual review. Discussion: Although some allocation principles seem better than others, no single moral principle allocates interventions justly, necessitating combining the moral principles into multiprinciple allocation systems. The urgency notwithstanding, navigating ethical challenges related to conducting corona virus disease (COVID-19) clinical trials is mandatory, in order to safeguard the safety and welfare of research participants, ensure autonomy of participants, reduce possibilities for exploitation and ensure opportunities for research participation. The ethical challenges to can be categorized as challenges in allocation of resources for research; challenges of clinical equipoise in relation to the research questions; challenges of understanding disclosed information in potential participants; and challenges in obtaining informed consent. Conclusion: To navigate these challenges, stakeholders need a delicate balance of moral principles during allocation of resources for research. Investigators need to apply information processing theories to aid decision-making about research participation or employ acceptable modifications to improve the informed consent process. Research and ethics committees should strengthen research review and oversight to ensure rigor, responsiveness and transparency.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:15","2023-07-03 03:09:15","","","","1","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fact, it has been proposed that physical exercise may modulate the immune system. However, the potential effect of an exercise program on COVID-19 survivors has not been investigated. Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the modifications in immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and perceived persistent symptoms after 6 weeks of supervised resistance training (RT), in addition to the standard care on the clinical status of patients with persistent COVID-19 symptoms. The objective of this protocol is to describe the scientific rationale in detail and to provide information about the study procedures. Methods/design: A total of 100 patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19 will be randomly allocated into either a group receiving standard care (control group) or a group performing a multicomponent exercise program two times a week over a period of 6 weeks. The main hypothesis is that a 6-week multicomponent exercise program (EXER-COVID Crossover Study) will improve the immunological and inflammatory profile, physical condition, and persistent perceived symptoms (fatigue/tiredness, musculoskeletal pain, and shortness of breath) in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19. Discussion: Our results will provide insights into the effects of a multicomponent exercise program on immunological parameters, physical condition, inflammatory profile, and persistent perceived symptoms in patients with postdischarge symptoms after COVID-19.

However, these concepts were developed during a time when “clinical trial” primarily referred to an individually randomized controlled trial. In the twenty-first century, there has been considerable innovation in trial design. Cluster randomized trials, biomarker-stratified or enrichment trials, and multi-arm platform trials are increasingly used. In this chapter, the authors show how each of these innovative designs raises new challenges for understanding and operationalizing ethical judgments regarding consent and equipoise. The features of innovative designs that drive the need for ethical concepts to evolve and adapt differ. In cluster randomized trials, the need to adapt is driven by the broader scope of such trials in terms of interventions and participants; in biomarker-stratified and enrichment designs, it is the complexity of the scientific hypothesis; and in multi-arm platform designs, it is the evolving set of interventions. Despite the sometimes quite dramatic changes to the structure and hypotheses of randomized controlled trials, the ethical concepts of equipoise and consent remain relevant for all randomized controlled trials.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:15","2023-07-03 03:09:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press Type: book-chapter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, several widely touted treatments failed to show effectiveness in large well-done randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Objective: To evaluate for COVID-19 treatments that showed no benefits in subsequent large RCTs how many of their most-cited clinical studies had declared favorable results for these interventions. Methods: Scopus (last update December 23, 2021) identified articles on lopinavir-ritonavir, hydroxycholoroquine/azithromycin, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, colchicine or interferon (index interventions) that represented clinical trials and that had received >150 citations. Their conclusions were assessed and correlated with study design features. The ten most recent citations for the most-cited article on each index intervention were examined on whether they were critical to the highly-cited study. Altmetric scores were also obtained. Findings: 40 articles of clinical studies on these index interventions had received >150 citations (7 exceeded 1,000 citations). 20/40 (50%) had favorable conclusions and 4 were equivocal. Highly-cited articles with favorable conclusions were rarely RCTs while those without favorable conclusions were mostly RCTs (3/20 vs 15/20, p=0.0003). Only 1 RCT with favorable conclusions had sample size >160. Citation counts correlated strongly with Altmetric scores, in particular news items. Only 9 (15%) of 60 recent citations to the most highly-cited studies with favorable or equivocal conclusions were critical to the highly-cited study. Conclusion: Many clinical studies with favorable conclusions for largely ineffective COVID-19 treatments are uncritically heavily cited and disseminated. Early observational studies and small randomized trials may cause spurious claims of effectiveness that get perpetuated.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:16","2023-07-03 03:09:16","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2022.01.11.22269097","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Background: Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the effects of anticoagulation on patients admitted with coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, since most of them consist of observational studies, the optimal dose still remains controversial. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of therapeutic anticoagulation compared with prophylactic anticoagulation in patients admitted with COVID-19. Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to minimise bias. PubMed and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were queried for the terms ""covid-19,"" ""(anticoagulation OR thromboprophylaxis),"" and ""randomised."" The same terms or relevant studies were also queried on the website of the ClinicalTrials.gov and relevant reviews. The clinical endpoints of interest were all-cause death, thromboembolism, and major bleeding. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: A total of 7 RCTs were included in this study. The risk of thromboembolism was lower (odds ratio (OR) 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.73; p &lt; 0.001) and the risk of major bleeding was higher (OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.21-2.90; p = 0.005) in the therapeutic anticoagulation group than in the prophylactic anticoagulation group. On the other hand, the risk of all-cause death was similar (OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.65-1.31; p = 0.65) between the 2 groups. In a subgroup analysis, the risk of thromboembolism was also lower in the therapeutic anticoagulation group compared with the prophylactic anticoagulation group both in moderately and severely ill patients, respectively. However, the risk of major bleeding was more likely to higher (OR 1.85; 95% CI 0.98-3.49; p = 0.06) in the therapeutic anticoagulation group than the prophylactic anticoagulation group only in severely ill patients. Conclusions: Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolism and a higher risk of major bleeding compared to prophylactic anticoagulation in patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Therapeutic anticoagulation may be more beneficial for moderately ill patients.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:16","2023-07-03 03:09:16","","","","","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press (OUP) Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We will apply the SS-MIX-MEM to supplement the Angiotensin receptor blocker-based Lung Protective Strategy for COVID-19 (ALPS-COVID) RCTs with the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database. ALPS-COVID includes both an inpatient and outpatient trial, which investigate losartan as a treatment for COVID-19. The outpatient trial sought to randomize 580 individuals but only enrolled 117, whereas the inpatient trial met its enrollment target and randomized 205 individuals. The N3C database has 3,237,344 COVID-19 cases alongside demographics, lab values, and more. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: In simulation studies, the proposed SS-MIX-MEM approach effectively leveraged a subgroup of supplemental real world data for RCT analyses, improving trial efficiency by increasing precision of treatment effect estimates, decreasing necessary sample size, and introducing minimal bias. In an influenza trial real world data application, the SS-MIX-MEM approach was able to effectively provide insight into treatment effect heterogeneity found in an RCT analogous to incorporating around 80 individuals into a subgroup analysis. We anticipate that leveraging external real world data in a re-analysis of the ALPS-COVID RCTs could provide new insights into losartan, a readily available, potentially beneficial therapeutic for COVID-19. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The high blood pressure drug, losartan, is readily available, has an established safety profile, and might be effective as a treatment for COVID-19. Given that we have very few effective treatment options and are still in the midst of a global pandemic, patients with COVID-19 would greatly benefit from a repurposed, readily available treatment.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:17","2023-07-03 03:09:17","","39–39","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press (CUP) Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has also sporadically been associated with viral infections, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, influenza vaccination and mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. Since the start of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in January 2021, the Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb has received 22 case reports of BCG reactivation after vaccination with a COVID-19 vaccine. In 20 case reports it concerned mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Moderna (14) and Pfizer (6). In 2 case reports the viral vector COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca was administered. Erythema and pain were the most frequently reported symptoms and the size of the inflammation was between 1.5 to 5 cm. BCG reactivation occurred with a median time to onset of 2 days after the second or booster COVID-19 vaccination, whereas the median time to onset was 7 days after the first COVID-19 vaccination. None of the BCG reactivations were treated. The exact mechanism of the occurrence of this specific reaction remains unknown, however involvement of heat shock protein 65 is suggested. BCG reactivation is a non-serious, self-limiting reaction that can occur after vaccination with both mRNA and viral vector COVID-19 vaccines.","2022","2023-07-03 03:09:18","2023-07-03 03:09:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Authorea, Inc.","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.22541/au.166524843.38242027/v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methodology: The study was a randomized, multi center, parallel design, placebo controlled, double blind, clinical trial in patients diagnosed with corona virus disease 2019 with mild or no symptoms and with stable co-morbidities. 118 enrolled subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either placebo treatment or ViraCide (active treatment). Result: The primary efficacy parameters of National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and 7 point ordinal showed a significantly greater improvement in the active group at the end of the study (P < 0.05). In case of NEWS, in the ViraCide group at visit 3, 74.6 % of the subjects had score of “0” which was higher than the placebo in which only 49.2% showed the reduction. In case of the 7 point ordinal scale, in the active group 76.3 % of the subjects had score of 1 which is significantly higher than that of placebo group which is only 47.5%. Time taken for clinical improvement with respect to negative RT PCR test also showed significant difference in the active v/s placebo group. The mean time taken by patients in the active group to test negative was 5.47 days which was significantly lower than placebo which was 6.97 days. The adverse events rate and severity were comparable in both the groups and no clinically significant adverse event was found in the active or placebo group. Conclusion: The use of ViraCide in mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients showed time frame reduction with respect to RT-PCR test, as well as clinical improvement demonstrated by NEWS and 7-point ordinal scale and certain laboratory parameters. Further clinical trials are required to evaluate role of ViraCide in managing COVID-19 and establish its mode of action.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:18","2023-07-03 03:09:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SciVision Publishers LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although recent reports indicate that three vaccine candidates are effective against SARS-CoV-2, more time is needed to generate enough doses for the general population. Meanwhile, frontline healthcare workers are at high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. To avoid collapse of the medical care system, there is a need to develop novel approaches to limit SARS-CoV-2 spread. Through a process called trained immunity, the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine boosts the action of innate immune cells, resulting in a nonspecific reduction in the incidence of viral infections. Due to this immunomodulatory action, the BCG vaccine is currently used as a therapeutic in bladder cancer. Data collected from epidemiological and observational studies indicate that BCG vaccination might provide protection against COVID-19. While these observations do not provide evidence of causality and are limited by cofounding and intrinsic biases, it is crucial to explore the hypothesis that BCG vaccination may provide a nonspecific innate immune boost and therefore protect against COVID-19 in randomized controlled clinical trials, particularly for people at higher risk of developing COVID-19, such as frontline healthcare workers.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:19","2023-07-03 03:09:19","","121–131","","2","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IOS Press Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The COVID-19 pandemic is accompanied by various stressors that require adjustment in everyday life and possibly changes in personal future prospects. While some individuals cope well with these challenges, some develop psychological distress including depressive symptoms, anxiety, or stress. Internet-based self-help interventions have proven to be effective in the treatment of various mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Based on that, we developed an internet-based self-help program for individuals with psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. The 3-week self-help program consists of 6 modules comprising texts, videos, figures, and exercises. Participants can request guidance within the self-help program (guidance on demand). The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of the self-help program compared to a waiting control condition. Methods: The design is a parallel group randomized controlled trial. Participants are allocated to a 3-week self-help intervention plus care as usual or a 3-week waiting period with only care as usual. There are follow-ups after 6 weeks and 18 weeks. At least 80 participants with COVID-19 pandemic related psychological distress will be recruited. Primary outcome are depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include anxiety and chronic stress, suicidal experiences and behavior, health-related quality of life, generalized optimism and pessimism, embitterment, optimistic self-beliefs, emotion regulation skills, loneliness, resilience, and the satisfaction with and usability of the self-help program. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies investigating the efficacy of an internet-based self-help program for psychological distress due to the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the results of this study may give further insight into the use of internet-based self-help programs in pandemic-related psychological distress.

For many public health interventions, the choice is not between sufficiently powered trials and underpowered trials, but between underpowered trials and no trials at all. Underpowered trials should be viewed as contributions to the larger body of evidence, alongside other studies of various sizes and designs, collectively assessed and synthesized in systematic reviews. Overemphasis on sample size calculation is probably more of a hindrance than a help to scientific progress.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:20","2023-07-03 03:09:20","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time, manuscripts describing these research projects underwent fast-track peer review procedures and were published in freely accessible formats. Although full texts about COVID-19 are currently available for free, abstracts continue to play a key role since they provide essential information and possibly a decision basis for therapies. Abstracts are particularly important in case the full texts are not free, not all reports have been published in English and in emergency situations when there is less time for comprehensive analysis of all full texts. It is therefore necessary to ensure that abstracts—as publications in miniature format—contain comprehensive and transparent information. The CONSORT statement for abstracts (CONSORT-A) offers guidelines to authors how to include all necessary information in an abstract. Methods: Based on a literature search in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library, all publications up to 29 October 2020 are identified and examined in terms of the subject matter (reported results from COVID-19 studies) and their study design (RTC). Subsequently, suitable publications are examined for completeness and quality of abstracts. The CONSORT checklist for RTC abstracts serves as a basis in this procedure. The primary endpoint of the study is the percentage of correctly implemented items of the CONSORT statement for abstracts. The frequency of correct reporting of each individual item is checked in a second step. Discussion: The study is expected to contribute to evaluating the reporting quality on COVID-19 studies, and specifically the completeness of abstracts of RTCs. It may thus support the assessment of current research into COVID-19. Trial registration: Registration was not required as the study investigated existing literature.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:20","2023-07-03 03:09:20","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since ARDS is due to a hyperinflammatory response to a direct injury, we decided to perform a meta-analysis and an evaluation of robustness of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of corticosteroids on mortality in ARDS in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. We conducted a systematic search of the literature from inception up to 30 October 2020, using the MEDLINE database and the PubMed interface. We evaluated the fragility index (FI) of the included RCTs using a two-by-two contingency table and the p-value produced by the Fisher exact test; the fragility quotient (FQ) was calculated by dividing the FI score by the total sample size of the trial. Results: Thirteen RCTs were included in the analysis; five of them were conducted in COVID-19 ARDS, including 7692 patients, while 8 RCTS were performed in non-COVID ARDS with 1091 patients evaluated. Three out of eight RCTs in ARDS had a FI > 0 while 2 RCTs out of five in COVID-19 had FI > 0. The median of FI for ARDS was 0.625 (0.47) while the median of FQ was 0.03 (0.014). The median of FI for COVID-19 was 6 (2) while the median of FQ was 0.059 (0.055). In this systematic review, we found that FI and FQ of RCTs evaluating the use of corticosteroids in ARDS and COVID-19 were low.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:21","2023-07-03 03:09:21","","5287–5287","","22","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: MDPI AG Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to its heterologous protective effects, the BCG vaccine has been proposed as a treatment option for coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Epidemiological studies have found that countries without BCG vaccination policy have experienced higher mortality rates related to COVID-19 infection than those with BCG vaccination policy. However, there are some confounding factors such as age, population intensity, immigration, the pandemic phase, and data accuracy that may affect these results.

We present two sequential randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that tackle this challenge with behavioral science insights. We deliver text-based nudges to UCLA Health patients one day (first RCT; N=113,229) and eight days (second RCT; N=90,662) after they receive notifications of vaccine eligibility. In the first RCT, text messages designed to make vaccination salient and easy to schedule boost appointment and vaccination rates by 86% and 26%, respectively. Nudges that make patients feel endowed with the vaccine heighten these effects, but addressing vaccine hesitancy via a video-based information intervention does not yield benefits beyond simple text. These results hold across ethnicity and age groups. By contrast, online experiments (N=2,003) soliciting hypothetical responses to the same messages reveal the opposite patterns, underscoring the importance of pilot-testing behavioral nudges in the real world before scaling them up. In the second RCT, we further find that receiving a second reminder boosts appointment and vaccination rates by 52% and 16%, respectively. Our findings suggest that text-based nudges can substantially increase and accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations at almost zero marginal cost, highlighting the promising role of behavioral science in addressing a critical component of the COVID-19 pandemic response.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:22","2023-07-03 03:09:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2021.04.12.21254876","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tocilizumab has been recently added to the treatment guidelines for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data remains conflicting. Methods: Electronic databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane central were searched from March 1, 2020, until February 28th, 2021, for randomized controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of tocilizumab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The outcomes assessed were all-cause mortality at 28 days, mechanical ventilation, and time to discharge. Results: Eight studies (with 6,311 patients) were included in the analysis. In total, 3,267 patients received tocilizumab, and 3,044 received standard care/placebo. Pooled analysis showed a significantly decreased risk of all-cause mortality at 28 days (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97, p=0.009) and progression to mechanical ventilation (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.90, p=0.0002) in the tocilizumab arm compared to standard therapy or placebo. In addition, there was a trend towards improved median time to hospital discharge (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.05-1.34, p=0.007). Conclusions: Tocilizumab therapy improves outcomes of mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection compared with standard therapy or placebo. Our findings suggest the efficacy of tocilizumab therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and strengthen the concept that tocilizumab is a promising therapeutic intervention to improve mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:22","2023-07-03 03:09:22","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2021.03.23.21254054","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first RCT reporting results on the impact of systemic corticosteroids on COVID-19 in a peer reviewed journal was the RECOVERY trial published in July, 2020. The RECOVERY trial showed a reduced risk of 28-day mortality in patients who received oral or intravenous dexamethasone for 10 days. Methods: Meta-analysis of peer reviewed RCTs comparing systemic corticosteroids to usual care or placebo. Results: Five English language RCTs were identified, including data from 7645 hospitalized patients worldwide using systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone in COVID-19 positive patients. Three RCTs were discontinued when preliminary results from the RECOVERY trial became available. Conclusions: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed literature by January 1, 2021 showed reduced mortality in critically ill patients but not all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who received systemic corticosteroids. The early termination of three of the included RCTs because of the preliminary results of the RECOVERY trial is likely to have dramatically influenced the results of this meta-analysis.

The median numbers of endpoints in trials with severe and non-severe patients were 9 and 7, respectively. Approximately 25% of the trials used multiple primary endpoints. Regardless of the type of endpoint, the time frames were longer in the trials with severe patients than in the trials with non-severe patients. In the evaluation of the clinical course, worsening was often considered in binary endpoints, and improvement was considered in time-to-event endpoints. The sample size was the largest in clinical trials using binary endpoints. Conclusions: Endpoints can differ with respect to severity, and the clinical course and time frame are important for defining endpoints.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ in addition to standard of care (SOC) in COVID-19. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of sciences, and medRxiv were searched up to March 15, 2021. Clinical studies registry databases were also searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The references list of the key studies was reviewed to identify additional relevant resources. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and Jadad checklist. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3). Eleven randomized controlled trials with a total number of 8161 patients were identified as eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups in terms of negative rate of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Risk ratio [RR]: 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90, 1.08; P = 0.76), PCR negative conversion time (Mean difference [MD]: − 1.06, 95% CI − 3.10, 0.97; P = 0.30), all-cause mortality (RR: 1.09, 95% CI 1.00, 1.20; P = 0.06), body temperature recovery time (MD: − 0.64, 95% CI − 1.37, 0.10; P = 0.09), length of hospital stay (MD: − 0.17, 95% CI − 0.80, 0.46; P = 0.59), use of mechanical ventilation (RR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.95, 1.32; P = 0.19), and disease progression (RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.37, 1.85; P = 0.64).

Higher maternal mental health distress, including perinatal anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-specific phobia, is supposed to be increasing during the pandemic, which impacts pregnant women’s health and their infants and calls for intervention. Due to the social distancing protocols posed by the pandemic, telemental health interventions have fast become the most common form of psychosocial support for maternal mental health. However, there is no evidence of the effectiveness of maternal low-intensity psychosocial telemental interventions in improving mental health outcomes. The trial’s objective is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of telemental low-intensity psychosocial interventions in pregnant and postpartum women attending the Women Wellness and Research Centre in Qatar in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis: The clinical trial is randomized in which pregnant women will be assigned equally through block randomization between two arms: (1) a control group and (2) an intervention group. The primary endpoint is the perinatal psychological distress, including perinatal depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 phobia in their third trimester; the secondary, tertiary, fourth, and fifth endpoints will be in the postnatal period (3–5 weeks, 2–4 months, 5–7 months, and 8–10 months). This trial involves pregnant women in their second trimester with no mental health illness history who communicate in English and Arabic and consent to participate. A sample size of 58 (29 participants per arm) is targeted. Discussion: This study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of low-intensity psychosocial maternal telemental interventions to be implemented as a preventive service.

As primary and secondary schools once again close in the face of surging infections, there is an opportunity to rigorously study their reopening. School-aged children appear to be less affected by COVID-19 than adults, yet schools may drive community transmission of the virus. Given the impact of school closures on both education and the economy, schools cannot remain closed indefinitely. But when and how can they be reopened safely? We argue that a cluster randomized trial is a rigorous and ethical way to resolve these uncertainties. We discuss key scientific, ethical, and resource considerations both to inform trial design of school reopenings and to prompt discussion of the merits and feasibility of conducting such a trial.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:24","2023-07-03 03:09:24","","371–376","","3","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Published and preprint randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing IVM effects on COVID-19 adult patients were searched until March 15, 2021 in five engines. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, length of stay (LOS), and adverse events (AE). Secondary outcomes included viral clearance and severe AEs. We evaluated risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2·0 tool. Inverse variance random effect meta-analyses were performed with quality of evidence (QoE) evaluated using GRADE methodology. Subgroup analyses by severity of disease and RoB, and sensitivity analyses by time of follow-up were conducted. Results: Ten RCTs (n=1173) were included. Controls were standard of care [SOC] in five RCTs and placebo in five RCTs. RCTs sample size ranged from 24 to 398 patients, mean age from 26 to 56 years-old, and severity of COVID-19 disease was mild in 8 RCTs, moderate in one RCT, and mild and moderate in one RCT. IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality vs. controls (RR 0.37, 95%CI 0.12 to 1.13, very low QoE). IVM did not reduce LOS vs. controls (MD 0.72 days, 95%CI -0.86 to 2.29, very low QoE). AEs, severe AE and viral clearance were similar between IVM and controls (low QoE for these three outcomes). Subgroups by severity of COVID-19 or RoB were mostly consistent with main analyses; all-cause mortality in three RCTs at high RoB was reduced with IVM. Sensitivity analyses excluding RCTs with follow up <21 days showed no difference in all-cause mortality. Conclusions: In comparison to SOC or placebo, IVM did not reduce all-cause mortality, length of stay or viral clearance in RCTs in COVID-19 patients with mostly mild disease. IVM did not have effect on AEs or SAEs. IVM is not a viable option to treat COVID-19 patients.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:24","2023-07-03 03:09:24","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2021.05.21.21257595","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Patients can suffer acute severe pain and may have long-term mental, cognitive, and functional health deterioration after discharge. However, few controlled trials are evaluating interventions for the prevention and treatment of PICS. The study hypothesis is that a specific care program based on early therapeutic education and psychological intervention improves the quality of life of patients at risk of developing PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The primary objective is to determine whether the program is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the intervention is superior to standard-of-care on health-related quality of life, incidence of chronic pain and degree of functional limitation, incidence of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress syndrome at 3 and 6 months after hospital discharge. Methods: The PAINCOVID trial is a unicentric randomized, controlled, patient-blinded superiority trial with two parallel groups. The primary endpoint is the health-related quality of life at 6 months after hospital discharge, and randomization will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. This paper details the methodology and statistical analysis plan of the trial and was submitted before outcome data were available. Discussion: This is the first randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of an early care therapeutic education, and psychological intervention program for the management of PICS and chronic pain after COVID-19. The intervention will serve as proof of the need to implement early care programs at an early stage, having an incalculable impact given the current scenario of the pandemic.

Early interventions may prevent short-term sleep problems from progressing to insomnia disorder. Although cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is effective in treating insomnia disorder, this can be time and resource-intensive. Further, online interventions can be used to deliver treatment to a large number of individuals. The objective of this study is to investigate if an online behavioural intervention, in the form of a leaflet, which has been successfully used alongside CBT-I for acute insomnia, can reduce symptoms of acute insomnia in poor sleepers. Methods: A total of 124 self-reported good and poor sleepers will be enrolled in an online stratified randomised controlled trial. After baseline assessments (T1), participants will complete a 1-week pre-intervention sleep monitoring period (T2) where they will complete daily sleep-diaries. Poor sleepers ( Discussion: It is expected that this online intervention will reduce symptoms of acute insomnia in self-reported short-term poor sleepers, and will also prevent the transition to poor sleep in good sleepers. We expect that this will demonstrate the feasibility of online interventions for the treatment and prevention of acute insomnia. Specific advantages of online approaches include the low cost, ease of administration and increased availability of treatment, relative to face-to-face therapy.

Recently, fear of vaccine side effects created widespread concern and paused global vaccination efforts. Many studies find that how medical risks are framed and communicated can influence individuals' perceptions and behavior, yet there is little evidence on how the communication of COVID-19 vaccine side-effect risks influences vaccine intentions. The primary objective of our study is to evaluate how the framing of vaccine-side effect risks impacts individuals' vaccine intentions and perceptions of vaccine safety. The study will assess the impact of 3 dimensions of side-effect framing: Trial design: Our study is an online-based randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effect of different vaccine side-effect framings on COVID-19 vaccine intentions and perceived safety for a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Using a factorial design, we will experimentally assess the impact of 3 risk framing strategies, varying whether the risk is presented: (1) with a qualitative label, (2) whether the risk is presented with a comparison risk, and (3) for comparison cases, whether the comparison is in absolute or relative terms. We will also randomize a portion of respondents to a status quo framing where the side effect risk mimics the media's communication in early April 2021. Participants: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific to recruit participants and host our study on the Gorilla platform. To be eligible, participants must be 18 years old or over (male, female, or other), have current residence in the US or UK, and be able to speak English. Participants will be excluded from the study if they do not meet our inclusion criteria. Intervention and comparator: Our study content will consist of five pages presented to individuals online. Page 1 will explain the purpose of the study and contain the consent information. Page 2 will contain basic sociodemographic questions, including participants' age, sex, and schooling level. Page 3 will set up the experiment by telling individuals that we will describe a hypothetical new COVID-19 vaccine and that we would like to know how likely they would be to take the vaccine and how safe they think the vaccine is. On this page, we will also encourage individuals to respond truthfully and remind them that their answers are confidential and cannot be linked back to any personal identifying information. Page 4 will be the main experimental slide, where we will present individuals with information on the vaccine, varying how the vaccination risk is communicated based on which experimental framing arm they are randomized to. Main outcomes: Our primary outcome is individuals' willingness to take the hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. We will measure this outcome by asking, ""How likely would you be to take this vaccine?"" allowing individuals to choose from a four-point Likert response of ""Unlikely, Unsure leaning towards unlikely, Unsure leaning towards likely, Very likely."" This outcome variable, including the categories and phrasing, is based on a recently published study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy conducted by researchers with the Vaccine Hesitance Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Our secondary outcome is individuals' perceived safety of the vaccine. We will assess this outcome by asking individuals, ""How safe do you feel this vaccine is?"" allowing them to choose answers ranging from 1-10 where 1 is extremely unsafe, and 10 is extremely safe. Both outcomes will be measured at the time of the questionnaire. Participants can take up to 45 min to complete the questions but will not be able to go back and change their responses after submitting their questionnaire. Randomization: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to each of the experimental arms. Gorilla allows for two randomization options - independent randomization of each individual based on a probability draw and balanced randomization, which randomizes without replacement such that among groups of respondents a fixed proportion will end up in each experimental arm. We will use the ""balanced randomization"" option to ensure that our experimental arms are balanced. Participants will be randomized based on the allocations described above. Blinding: Because Prolific handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. Numbers to be randomized: We will randomize 6000 participants per country for a total sample of 12000 individuals. Trial status: The protocol version number is 1.0 and the date is July 14, 2021. Recruitment is expected to begin on 26 July 2021 and end by August 10, 2021.

We are often faced with the difficult decision between having weak trials or not having a trial at all. In a recent article, Dr. Atle Fretheim argues that statistically underpowered studies are still valuable, particularly in conjunction with other similar studies in meta-analysis in the context of the DANMASK-19 trial, asking “Surely, some trial evidence must be better than no trial evidence?” However, informative trials are not always feasible, and feasible trials are not always informative. In some cases, even a well-conducted but weakly designed and/or underpowered trial such as DANMASK-19 may be uninformative or worse, both individually and in a body of literature. Meta-analysis, for example, can only resolve issues of statistical power if there is a reasonable expectation of compatible well-designed trials. Uninformative designs may also invite misinformation. Here, we make the case that—when considering informativeness, ethics, and opportunity costs in addition to statistical power—“nothing” is often the better choice.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:26","2023-07-03 03:09:26","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this scoping review, uses of equipoise in discussions of randomized controlled trials (RCT) of COVID-19 therapies are evaluated to answer three questions. First, how has equipoise been applied to COVID-19 research? Second, has equipoise been employed accurately? And third, do concerns about equipoise pose a barrier to the ethical conduct of COVID-19 RCTs? Methods: Google Scholar and Pubmed were searched for articles containing substantial discussion about equipoise and COVID-19 RCTs. 347 article titles were screened, 91 full text articles were assessed, and 48 articles were included. Uses of equipoise were analyzed and abstracted into seven categories. Results and discussion: Approximately two-thirds of articles (33/48 articles) used equipoise in a way that is consistent with the concept. They invoked equipoise to support (1) RCTs of specific therapies, (2) RCTs in general, and (3) the early termination of RCTs after achieving the primary outcome. Approximately one-third of articles (15/48 articles) used equipoise in a manner that is inconsistent with the concept. These articles argued that physician preference, widespread use of unproven therapies, patient preference, or expectation of therapeutic benefit may undermine equipoise and render RCTs unethical. In each case, the purported ethical problem can be resolved by correcting the use of equipoise. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the continued relevance of equipoise as it supports the conduct of well-conceived RCTs and provides moral guidance to physicians and researchers as they search for effective therapies for COVID-19.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:27","2023-07-03 03:09:27","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We refute this argument on two counts. First the global equity and justice issue, that the scarcity of vaccines in most countries is created by the rich nations that have hoarded vaccines. Second, the science versus research ethics issue, that there are valid scientific methods like non-inferiority trials which can give reliable results, and that applying a standard of care imposed by rich nations is both unethical and possibly exploitative.

We aimed at providing an overview of randomized trials assessing NPIs to prevent COVID-19. Methods: We included all randomized trials assessing NPIs to prevent COVID-19 in any country and setting registered in Results: We identified 41 randomized trials. Of them, 11 were completed (26.8%) including 7 with published results. The 41 trials planned to recruit a median of 1,700 participants (IQR, 588 to 9,500, range 30 to 35,256,399) with a median planned duration of 8 months (IQR, 3 to 14, range 1 to 24). Most came from the United States (n=11, 26.8%). The trials mostly assessed protective equipment (n=11, 26.8%), COVID-19-related information and education programs (n=9, 22.0%), access to mass events under specific safety measures (n=5, 12.2%), testing and screening strategies (n=5, 12.2%), and hygiene management (n=5, 12.2%). Conclusions: Worldwide, 41 randomized trials assessing NPIs have been initiated with published results available to inform policy decisions for only 7 of them. A long-term research agenda including behavioral, environmental, social, and systems level interventions is urgently needed to guide policies and practices in the current and future public health emergencies.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:28","2023-07-03 03:09:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2021.08.20.21261687","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data for the use of steroids in COVID-19 is emerging. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effectiveness of steroid administration in mortality reduction due to COVID-19 compared to the control group. A systematic search of the Pubmed and Embase databases was performed to extract randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the use of steroid therapy for COVID-19. An overall and subgroup (based upon the type of steroid) pooled mortality analysis was performed, and odds ratios were reported. Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Six RCTs, including 7707 patients, were selected for review. Three trials reported 28-day mortality, and two trials reported 21-day mortality, and one trial reported in-hospital mortality. There were 730 deaths among 2837 participants in the steroid group while 1342 deaths among 4870 patients randomized to the control group (Odds ratio 0.76, 95% confidence interval 0.58-1.00, p=0.05). The effect was significant in patients on oxygen or mechanical ventilation. There was no difference in the various preparations and doses of the steroids. There was heterogeneity among the trials as the I2 value was 53%, with a p-value of 0.06. There was no indication of increased serious adverse events. This meta-analysis of RCTs demonstrated that the use of systemic corticosteroids is associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in patients with COVID-19 on oxygen or mechanical ventilation.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:28","2023-07-03 03:09:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: PAGEPress Publications Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Randomized controlled trials are required to report results according to the intention-to-treat estimand, but recent methodological guidance recognizes the importance of estimating other causal quantities. Methods:: This article outlines an analytical framework for randomized controlled trials with non-compliance. We apply the ICH E9 (R1) addendum and combine it with the potential outcomes framework to define key estimands, outline the major assumptions for identification of each estimand, and highlight the assumptions that cannot be verified from the randomized controlled trial data. We contrast the assumptions and estimates in a re-analysis of the REFLUX trial. We report alternative estimates for the effectiveness of receipt of laparoscopic surgery versus medical management for patients with gastro-intestinal reflux disease. Results:: The article finds that adjusted as-treated and per-protocol estimates were similar in magnitude to those based intention-to-treat methods. Instrumental variable estimates of the complier average causal effect were larger, with wider confidence intervals. Conclusion:: We recommend that in randomized controlled trials with non-compliance, studies should outline which estimand is most relevant to the study context, evaluate key assumptions, and present estimates from a range of methods as a sensitivity analysis.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:28","2023-07-03 03:09:28","","97–106","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Outbreak forecasting and mathematical modelling suggest that these numbers will continue to rise. Early identification of effective remedies that can shorten the duration and severity of illness is critical for Lagos State, which is the epi-centre of the disease in Nigeria. Methods: This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled superiority trial. The study investigates the efficacy of chloroquine phosphate, hydroxychloroquine sulphate and lopinavir/ritonavir added on to standard of care compared to standard of care only in patients with COVID-19 disease. The primary outcome is the clinical status of patients measured using a 7-point ordinal scale at day 15. Research participants and clinicians will be blinded to the allocated intervention. Outcome measures will be directly assessed by clinicians. Statistical analysis will be done by a team blinded to the identity and allocation of research participants. Data analysis will follow intention-to-treat methods, using R software. Discussion: The current study is of strategic importance for Lagos State in potentially curbing the health, social and economic burden of COVID-19 disease. Should the current study demonstrate that either of the three intervention drugs is more efficacious than standard therapy alone, the State Ministry of Health will develop an evidence-based guideline for the management of COVID-19 in Lagos State. The findings will also be shared nationally and with other states which may lead to a standardized national guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

We describe implementation at the first US site, the UPMC health system, and offer recommendations for implementation at other sites. Methods: To implement REMAP-COVID, we focused on six major areas: engaging leadership, trial embedment, remote consent and enrollment, regulatory compliance, modification of traditional trial management procedures, and alignment with other COVID-19 studies. Results: We recommend aligning institutional and trial goals and sharing a vision of REMAP-COVID implementation as groundwork for learning health system development. Embedment of trial procedures into routine care processes, existing institutional structures, and the electronic health record promotes efficiency and integration of clinical care and clinical research. Remote consent and enrollment can be facilitated by engaging bedside providers and leveraging institutional videoconferencing tools. Coordination with the central institutional review board will expedite the approval process. Protocol adherence, adverse event monitoring, and data collection and export can be facilitated by building electronic health record processes, though implementation can start using traditional clinical trial tools. Lastly, establishment of a centralized institutional process optimizes coordination of COVID-19 studies. Conclusions: Implementation of the REMAP-COVID trial within a large US healthcare system is feasible and facilitated by multidisciplinary collaboration. This investment establishes important groundwork for future learning health system endeavors.

The ClinicalTrials.gov registry, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), and the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) were searched from inception to September 1, 2020. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Qualitative and quantitative analysis were performed. We identified 36 clinical studies involving anticoagulation in COVID-19. Most common study location was the United States (n=12, 33%). Thirty studies were randomized-controlled (83%) of which 22 were open-label. Median sample size was 309 (IQR 139-952) and study duration was 233 days (IQR 174-357). Most common study setting was critical and non-critical care (n=21, 58%). Most common single primary outcome was all-cause mortality (n=15, 42%) but thrombotic events represent the overall most common primary outcome (n=28, 77%).

Intervention and comparator: Kampo group: participants receive HET in 9 tablets 2 times per day for 8 weeks. Main outcomes: Primary outcome: Number of patients with a SARS-CoV-2 RNA by ploymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive result with at least one symptom (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) during the 12-week study period (including the 4-week observation period after oral administration). Randomisation: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using minimization implemented with the Electric data capture system (DATATRAK Enterprise Cloud), with balancing of the arms with age range (under 50 years of age or not) and having a history of risk factors for COVID-19 (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, respiratory diseases). Blinding (masking): Only participants will be randomized. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The main research hypothesis of this study is that Kampo medicines significantly prevent the onset of COVID-19. It is assumed that the infection rate before the administration of the drug under consideration will be 0% and that the incidence of COVID-19 thereafter will be 2- 3%, of which 70%-80% will show symptoms of COVID-19. Assuming that the pharmaceutical effect of the drug will be effective in 50% of patients and that the incidence rates in the placebo and drug groups will be 1.4%-2.4% and 0.7%-1.2%, respectively, the placebo is calculated at 2%, and the study drug at 1%. Since the frequency of verification is low and the number of cases will be large, we set a total of 10 analyses (9 interim analyses and a final analysis). Since the number of cases at the time of the final analysis will be 4,986 under the conditions of α = 0.05 and a power of 80% by the Peto method. We set at 600 cases in each interim analysis with an estimated dropout rate of 16.9%. Finally, the total number of cases is set to 6,000 with 3,000 in the placebo group and 3,000 in the HET group.

Trial design: The CARED trial is an investigator-initiated, multicentre, randomized, parallel, two-arm, sequential, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trial. It was planned as a pragmatic trial since the inclusion criteria are broad and the study procedures are as simple as possible, in order to be implemented in the routine clinical practice in general wards in the pandemic setting and a middle-income country context. The sequential design involves two stages. The first stage will assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation on blood oxygenation (physiological effects). The second stage will assess the effects on clinical outcomes. Participants: Participants of either gender admitted to general adult wards in 21 hospital sites located in four provinces of Argentina are invited to participate in the study if they meet the following inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria: Intervention and comparator: The intervention consists in a single oral dose of 500.000 IU of commercially available cholecalciferol soft gel capsules (5 capsules of 100.000 IU) or matching placebo Main outcomes: The primary outcome for the first stage is the change in the respiratory Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFAr) score between pre-treatment value and the worst value recorded during the first 7 seven days of hospitalization, the death or discharge, whichever occurs first. The SOFAr score measured as the ratio between the pulse oximetry saturation (SpO Randomisation: A computer-generated random sequence and the treatment assignment is performed through the web-based randomization module available in the electronic data capture system (Castor®). A randomization ratio 1:1, stratified and with permuted blocks was used. Stratification variables were diabetes (yes/no), age (≤60/>60 years) and the site. Blinding (masking): Double-blind was achieved by using placebo soft gel capsules with the same organoleptic properties as the active medication. Central management of the medication is carried out by a pharmacist in charge of packaging the study drug in unblinded fashion, who have no contact with on-site investigators. Medication is packaged in opaque white bottles, each containing five soft gel capsules of the active drug or matching placebo, corresponding to complete individual treatment. Treatment codes are kept under the pharmacist responsibility, and all researchers are unaware of them. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The first stage is planned to include 200 patients (100 per group), the second stage is planned to include 1064 additional patients.

Humanity managed to defeat a number of infections only thanks to specific preventive measures, i.e., vaccination. In 2020, society faced the new COVID-19 virus that has swept the whole world. The situation required swift and decisive action, including in what concerned vaccine development. It has also raised a number of ethical issues. The article analyzes ethical issues related to clinical trials and vaccination against COVID-19 by studying the regulations, literary sources and bioethical incidents. The key problems identified are: human participation in clinical trials during a pandemic, availability and, simultaneously, voluntariness of vaccination, public confidence in the SARS-Cov-2 vaccines approved for clinical practice. The study showed that the basic principles of clinical trials, voluntariness and awareness, are violated. It was revealed that despite all the efforts of public organizations and WHO initiatives in the world, there is a pronounced imbalance in the availability of the developed vaccines, while the vaccination voluntariness principle is violated by application of various mechanisms to put pressure on people, and public confidence in the developed vaccines can be called insufficient. In general, the problem of vaccination against COVID-19 remains relevant and requires comprehensive discussion.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:30","2023-07-03 03:09:30","","","","2021","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key question is whether the landscape of clinical research has also changed. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we examined the association of the COVID-19 outbreak with new clinical trial activations. Trial data for all interventional and observational oncology, cardiovascular, and mental health studies from January 2015 through September 2020 were obtained from Results: We examined 62,252 trial activations. During the initial COVID-19 outbreak (February 2020 through May 2020), model-estimated monthly trial activations for US-based studies were only 57% of the expected estimate had the pandemic not occurred (relative risk = 0.57, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.61, Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the disproportionate burden of COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths during the initial phase of the pandemic in the USA. Reduced activation of cancer clinical trials will likely slow the pace of clinical research and new drug discovery, with long-term negative consequences for cancer patients. An important question is whether the renewed outbreak period of winter 2020/2021 will have a similarly negative impact on the initiation of new clinical research studies for non-COVID-19 diseases.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:30","2023-07-03 03:09:30","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that continuation of RAAS inhibition will be superior to temporary discontinuation with regards to the primary endpoint of a global rank sum score. The global rank sum score has been successfully used in previous cardiovascular clinical trials. Trial design: This is an open label parallel two arm (1,1 ratio) randomized control superiority trial of approximately 40 COVID-19 patients who are on chronic RAAS inhibitor therapy. Participants: Adults who are admitted to hospital within the McGill University Health Centre systems (MUHC) including Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH), Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and Jewish General Hospital (JGH) and who are within 96 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis (confirmed via PCR on any biological sample) will be considered for the trial. Of note, the initial protocol to screen and enrol within 48 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis was extended through an amendment, to 96 hours to increase feasibility. Participants have to be 18 years or older and would have to be on RAAS inhibitors for at least a month to be considered eligible for the study. Additionally, RAAS inhibitors should not have been held for more than 48 hours before randomization. A list of inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in the full protocol document. In order to prevent heart failure exacerbation, patients with reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial. Intervention and comparator: All the study participants will be randomized to a strategy of temporarily holding the RAAS inhibitor [intervention] versus continuing the RAAS inhibitor [continued standard of care]. Among participants who are randomized to the intervention arm, alternative guide-line directed anti-hypertensive medication will be provided to the treating physician team (detail in study protocol). In the intervention arm RAAS inhibitor will be withheld for a total of 7 days with the possibility of the withdrawn medication being initiated at any point after day 7 or on the day of discharge. The recommendation for re-initiating the withdrawn medication will be made to the treating physician. The re-initiation of these therapies are according to standard convention and follow-up as per Canadian guidelines. Additionally, the date of restarting the withdrawn medication or whether the medication was re-prescribed on discharge or not, will be collected. This will be used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, biomarkers such as troponin, c-reactive protein (CRP) and lymphocyte count will be assessed during the same time period. Samples will be collected on randomization, day 4 and day 7. Main outcomes: Primary endpoint: In this study the primary end point is a global rank score calculated for all participants, regardless of treatment assignment ( score from 0 to 7). Please refer to table 4 in the full protocol. In the context of the current trial, it is estimated that death is the most meaningful endpoint, and therefore has the highest score ( score of 7). This is followed by admission to ICU, the need for mechanical ventilation etc. The lowest scores ( score of 1) are assigned to biomarker changes (e.g. change in troponin, change in CRP). This strategy has been used successfully in cardiovascular disease trials and therefore is applicable to the current trial. Randomization: Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization will be performed within an electronic database system at the time of enrolment using a random number generator, an approach that has been successfully used in other clinical trials. Neither participant, study team, or treating team will be blinded to the intervention arm. Blinding: This is an open label study with no blinding. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The approximate number of participants required for this trial is 40 patients (randomized 1:1 to continuation versus discontinuation of RAAS inhibitors). This number was calculated based on previous rates of outcomes for COVID-19 in the literature (e.g. death, ICU transfer) and statistical power calculations.

Trial design: SAINT PERU is a triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel arms to evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in negativizing nasopharyngeal PCR in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Participants: The trial is conducted in two national hospitals in Lima-Peru. The study population is patients with a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in a nasopharyngeal specimen, symptomatic for 96 hours or less, with non-severe COVID-19 disease at baseline, regardless of the presence of risk factors for progression to severity. The study will not include pregnant women or minors (17 years old or younger). Intervention and comparator: Ivermectin (300 mcg/kg) or placebo will be administered in one daily dose for three consecutive days. Currently, there is no solid data on the efficacy of ivermectin against the virus Main outcomes: Primary Randomization: Participants will be randomized to receive one dose of 300 mcg/kg ivermectin or placebo daily for three consecutive days. The epidemiologist will generate a list of correlative numbers, in randomized blocks of size 4, with the assignment to the treatment groups (a and b). The randomization list will be kept in an encrypted file accessible only to the trial statistician. This list will be handed directly to the pharmacist. Independently, the principal investigator will randomly assign the intervention (ivermectin) to one of the two groups (a or b) by tossing a coin, and will inform the pharmacist of the result of this process.

In December 2019, just before the pandemic, we were awarded a grant to conduct a randomised controlled trial, the Should I Take Aspirin? (SITA) trial, in Victoria, the Australian state most heavily affected by COVID-19 during 2020. Main body: We originally modelled the SITA trial recruitment method on previous trials where participants were approached and recruited in general practice waiting rooms. COVID-19 changed the way general practices worked, with a significant increase in telehealth consultations and restrictions on in person waiting room attendance. This prompted us to adapt our recruitment methods to this new environment to reduce potential risk to participants and staff, whilst minimising any recruitment bias. We designed a novel teletrial model, which involved calling participants prior to their general practitioner appointments to check their eligibility. We delivered the trial both virtually and face-to-face with similar overall recruitment rates to our previous studies. Conclusion: We developed an effective teletrial model which allowed us to complete recruitment at a high rate. The teletrial model is now being used in our other primary care trials as we continue to face the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.","2021","2023-07-03 03:09:33","2023-07-03 03:09:33","","","","1","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

COVID-19-related ARDS is subject to a mortality rate of 50% and prolonged period of mechanical ventilation, with no specific pharmacological treatment currently available (Infection au nouveau Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), COVID-19, France et Monde. Methods: The trial is a phase III double-blind, randomized, multicenter, parallel group, concurrent, controlled study in hospitalized participants with COVID-19 requiring mechanical ventilation using a sequential design. Participants in the treatment group will receive infusions of polyvalent immunoglobulin for 4 consecutive days, and the placebo group will receive an equivalent volume of sodium chloride 0.9% for the same duration. The primary outcome is the number of ventilator-free days up to the 28th day. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of IVIG on (1) organ failure according to the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 14 and 28 days, (2) lung injury score at 14 and 28 days, (3) the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events of IVIG, (4) length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, (5) length of hospital stay, (6) functional outcomes at day 90 defined by the activities of daily living and instrumental activities of the daily living scales, and (7) 90-day survival. One hundred thirty-eight subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to IVIG or placebo groups (69 in each group), considering 90% power, alpha level 0.05 (two sides), and 0.67 effect size level. Discussion: The ICAR trial investigates the effect of IVIG in COVID-19-related ARDS. We expect an increase in the survival rate and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, which is associated with significant morbidity. Trial registration: EudraCT 2020-001570-30.

Trial design: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-arm clinical trial. Participants: The study participants will be recruited from patients admitted to the ICU of Al-Zahra hospital with a definitive diagnosis of COVID-19. The inclusion criteria are aged between 20 and 75 years, confirmation of COVID-19 based on the PCR test, and admitted to the ICU. The exclusion criteria include the present use of parenteral nutrition support, a history of underlying diseases such as congenital disorders, immune diseases, renal and hepatic insufficiency, and pancreatitis, a history of sensitivity to herbal remedies such as turmeric and pepper, and regular use of anticoagulant drugs such as warfarin. This study will be performed in the Al-Zahra hospital, an academic hospital affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. Intervention and comparator: Sixty eligible patients will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive curcumin-piperine capsules (three capsules/day; each capsules containing 500 mg curcumin plus 5 mg piperine; in total 1500 mg curcumin and 15 mg piperine/daily) for seven days (n=30) or matching placebo capsules (three capsules/day; each capsules containing 505 mg maltodextrin; totally 1515 mg, maltodextrin/ daily) for same duration (n=30). Capsules will be administered after oral or enteral feeding at 9, 15 and 21 o’clock. Main outcomes: The primary outcome is the time from initiation of supplementation (curcumin-piperine or placebo) to normalization of fever, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation. The secondary outcomes are the mortality rate, length of stay in ICU, temperature, levels of blood oxygen saturation, ventilator dependency, respiratory rate, levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), levels of liver markers (ALT, AST, LDH), and levels of kidney function markers (BUN, Creatinine). Follow up: All of the parameters will be assessed at baseline and end of the study (7 days intervention). In addition, the rate of mortality will be collected after 4 weeks (28 days’ mortality in the ICU, 4 weeks follow up). Randomisation: Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group (Curcumin-piperine) or the control group (Placebo). Randomization sequences will be generated using an electronic table of random numbers to allocate the included participants into either control or intervention groups (in a 1:1 ratio) using the stratified block randomization method. Stratification was conducted according to sex (male and female), with a block size of four. The allocation sequences will be prepared by an independent statistician and will be kept inside sealed, opaque, and consecutively numbered envelopes. Participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians will be unaware of the trial-group assignment. Blinding (masking): This study is a double-blind clinical trial (participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians). The curcumin-piperine and placebo supplements will be similar in the terms of texture, taste, color, odor, and weight. Both tablets will be provided in containers that are completely identical in weight, shape, labeling, and packaging. All participants, investigators, nurses, and physicians will be unaware of the trial-group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The sample size is estimated at 60 participants, including 30 patients in the intervention group and 30 patients in the placebo group. Trial Status: The protocol is Version 2, registered on May 13, 2021. Recruitment began May 20, 2021, and is anticipated to be completed by September 20, 2021.

Multiple-dose BCG vaccine repurposing for COVID-19 will be an uprising breakthrough of vaccine discovery with safer outcomes. BCG induces cross-protection that might not be related to the target disease as innate immune cells, including monocytes and natural killer cells, contribute to this immune protection as known as “trained immunity” [1]. BCG had multifaceted protection against TB, Leprosy &amp;amp; heterogeneous pathogens [2]. Moreover, it was repositioned as a treatment for type-1 diabetes, many types of cancer &amp;amp; multiple sclerosis [2]. BCG vaccine accelerates the “resetting” of the immune system [3] or “turn on” immunity mechanism that agrees with its pleiotropic repurposing for many diseases. Multiple-dose BCG vaccine was used for reversing type-1 diabetes &amp;amp; for treating bladder cancer [4-5]. While intravesical multiple doses of BCG for bladder cancer showed many complications [6-7], intradermal multiple doses of BCG for diabetes showed high safety profile [4]. As recent studies have shown that upon certain vaccinations, human innate immune cells can undergo extensive metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, which results in enhanced immune responses upon heterologous re-infection, a process termed trained immunity [8]; The author recommends that COVID-19 vaccination clinical trials should consider multiple doses of BCG. After reviewing the recent COVID-19 literature, although some preliminary studies suggested BCG to fight COVID-19 [9-12], they did not consider the use of multiple intradermal BCG vaccination (at least 2 doses, 4 weeks apart [4]) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 outbreak. I do recommend that diabetic patients should participate in clinical trials to benefit from the reported BCG anti-hyperglycemic effect [4]. What if safe multiple doses of BCG turned on the immunity and protected people from COVID-19 more efficiently than a single dose?</p>","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:36","2023-07-03 03:09:36","","","","","","","","","","","","","Center for Open Science","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.31219/osf.io/h24bj","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluated the association of BCG vaccination on morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV2, adjusted for country-specific responses to the epidemic, demographics and health. SARS-CoV2 cases and deaths as reported by 31 May 2020 in the World Health Organization situation reports were used. Countries with at least 28 days following the first 100 cases, and available information on BCG were included. We used log-linear regression models to explore associations of cases and deaths with the BCG vaccination policy in each country, adjusted for population size, gross domestic product, proportion aged over 65 years, stringency level measures, testing levels, smoking proportion, and the time difference from date of reporting the 100th case to 31 May 2020. We further looked at the association that might have been found if the analyses were done at earlier time points. The study included 97 countries with 73 having a policy of current BCG vaccination, 13 having previously had BCG vaccination, and 11 having never had BCG vaccination. In a log-linear regression model there was no effect of country-level BCG status on SARS-CoV2 cases or deaths. Univariable log-linear regression models showed a trend towards a weakening of the association over time. We found no statistical evidence for an association between BCG vaccination policy and either SARS-CoV2 morbidity or mortality.

Indeed, high prevalence rates of depression, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been reported in Chinese healthcare workers during the epidemic peak. Symptoms of psychological distress are expected to be long-lasting and have a systemic impact on healthcare systems, warranting the need for evidence-based psychological treatments aiming at relieving immediate stress and preventing the onset of psychological disorders in this population. In the current COVID-19 context, internet-based interventions have the potential to circumvent the pitfalls of face-to-face formats and provide the flexibility required to facilitate accessibility to healthcare workers. Online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in particular has proved to be effective in treating and preventing a number of stress-related disorders in populations other than healthcare workers. The aim of our randomized controlled trial study protocol is to evaluate the efficacy of the ‘My Health too’ CBT program—a program we have developed for healthcare workers facing the pandemic—on immediate perceived stress and on the emergence of psychiatric disorders at 3- and 6-month follow-up compared to an active control group (i.e., bibliotherapy). Methods: Powered for superiority testing, this six-site open trial involves the random assignment of 120 healthcare workers with stress levels > 16 on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) to either the 7-session online CBT program or bibliotherapy. The primary outcome is the decrease of PSS-10 scores at 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include depression, insomnia, and PTSD symptoms; self-reported resilience and rumination; and credibility and satisfaction. Assessments are scheduled at pretreatment, mid-treatment (at 4 weeks), end of active treatment (at 8 weeks), and at 3-month and 6-month follow-up. Discussion: This is the first study assessing the efficacy and the acceptability of a brief online CBT program specifically developed for healthcare workers. Given the potential short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers’ mental health, but also on healthcare systems, our findings can significantly impact clinical practice and management of the ongoing, and probably long-lasting, health crisis.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of HCQ plus the standard of care in COVID-19 patients. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, and web of sciences were searched up to June 1, 2020. The references list of the key studies was reviewed for additional relevant resources. Clinical studies registry databases were searched for identifying potential clinical trials. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan software (version 5.3). Results: Three randomized controlled trials with total number of 242 patients were identified eligible for meta-analysis. No significant differences were observed between HCQ and standard care in terms of viral clearance (Risk ratio [RR] = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.91, 1.16; P = 0.68), disease progression (RR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.10, 0.81; P = 0.94), Chest CT (RR = 1.40; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.91; P = 0.03). There is a significant difference between HCQ and standard care for adverse events (RR = 2.88; 95% CI = 1.50, 5.54; P = 0.002). Conclusion: Although the current meta-analysis failed to confirm the efficacy and safety of HCQ in the treatment of COVID-19 patients, further rigorous randomized clinical trials are necessary to evaluate conclusively the efficacy and safety of HCQ against COVID-19.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:37","2023-07-03 03:09:37","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2020.06.05.20122705","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The E-E video’s effectiveness, however, remains unclear. Trial Design: The present study is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of the CoVideo against an attention placebo control (APC) video or no video. The trial has an intervention arm (CoVideo), placebo arm (APC), and control arm (no video). Nested in each trial arm is a list experiment and questionnaire survey, with the following ordering. Participants: This will be an online study setting. We will use Prolific Academic (ProA: Intervention and comparator: The intervention is an E-E video about COVID-19 hygiene (CoVideo). Developed by our co-author (MA) for Stanford Medicine, the CoVideo is animated with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text. The CoVideo shows how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and summarizes the public’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Key components of the CoVideo are the promotion of five hygiene practices: i) social distancing and avoiding group gatherings, ii) frequently washing hands with soap and water or sanitizer, iii) cleaning surfaces at home (e.g., kitchen counters), iv) not sharing eating utensils, and v) avoidance of stockpiling essential goods (such as toilet paper and face masks). The CoVideo, which was designed for universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels, can be viewed at Main outcomes: This study will measure primary and secondary outcomes related to COVID-19 hygiene. By hygiene, we mean the adoption of behaviors or practices that reduce the chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19. As our primary outcome, we will measure changes in behavioral intent toward five hygiene practices: social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, not sharing eating utensils, and not stockpiling essential goods. As a secondary outcome, we will measure knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. Randomization: Using a web-based randomization algorithm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants to the intervention (CoVideo), placebo (APC), or control (no video) arm (sequence generation) at a 1:1:1 ratio. Within each trial arm, Gorilla will randomly allocate participants at a 1:1 ratio to the control or treatment group. Items in the lists will be randomly ordered to avoid order effects. The presentation order of the list experiments will also be randomized. Blinding: Because ProA handles the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants will be completely anonymous to the study investigators. The outcome measures will be self-reported and submitted anonymously. All persons in the study team will be blinded to the group allocation. Numbers to be randomized: The Gorilla algorithm will randomize 6,700 participants to each trial arm, giving a total sample size of 20,100.

Here, we aim to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effectiveness of remdesivir and placebo in patients with COVID-19. Method and analysis: We will search MEDLINE-PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google scholar databases without restriction in year of publication. We will include randomized controlled trials that assessed the effectiveness of remdesivir versus placebo for patients confirmed with COVID-19. We will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA 2015) guidelines for the design and reporting of the results. The primary endpoint will be time to clinical recovery. The secondary endpoints will be all cause mortality, discharged date, frequency of respiratory progression, and treatment-emergent adverse events. Two independent authors will perform study selection, data extraction, and methodology quality assessment. RevMan 5.3 software will be used for statistical analysis. Random/fixed effect model will be carried out to calculate mean differences for continuous outcomes and risk ratio for dichotomous outcomes between remdesivir and placebo. Ethics and dissemination: This study does not require ethical approval, because no participant’s data will be involved in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The findings of this study will be published in reputable and peer-reviewed journal. Registration: This review protocol is submitted in PROSPERO database for registration and we will include the registration number in the revised version of the manuscript.

Is to present the state of knowledge from April and May 2020 about the influence of Bacillus-Calmette-Guérin vaccination against tuberculosis on incidence and mortality due to COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A review of the latest literature till 9 May 2020 has been made. PubMed and ResearchGate databases and WHO reports were used. RESULTS. Immunomodulatory properties of the tuberculosis vaccine which protects against severe cases of tuberculosis and partly against other infections are indicated, including viral and respiratory infections. The BCG vaccine induces heterologous immunity and trained innate immunity. It was noted that in countries which maintain obligatory BCG vaccination COVID-19 incidence and mortality are lower than in countries that have stopped or never introduced BCG as mandatory vaccination. Most analysis confirmed this relationship, but they indicated the possible impact of other factors, such as genetics in the population, the type of strain from BCG vaccine, the level of health care and the wealth of a nation, the structure of migration, co-morbidities and a policy of introducing social distance. CONCLUSIONS. At the moment, we do not have enough evidence to support or deny the hypothesis of COVID-19 reduction in incidence and mortality in countries maintaining obligatory BCG vaccination. Other factors that might affect the results should be considered in further analysis. The results of clinical trials will provide more reliable proofs than analysis of epidemiological data. WHO does not recommend BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 and recommends it to newborns from areas with a higher incidence of tuberculosis.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:39","2023-07-03 03:09:39","","290–302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: National Institute of Public Health – National Institute of Hygiene Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some group interventions for siblings exist, but few have clearly described parent components and none are considered evidence-based. Methods: We are conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing a five-session manual-based group intervention for siblings (aged 8 to 16 years) and parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders to a 12-week waitlist, called SIBS-RCT. The intervention comprises three separate sibling and parent group sessions and two joint sessions in which each sibling talks to their parent alone. The intervention aims at improving parent-child communication and covers themes such as siblings’ understanding of the neurodevelopmental disorder, siblings’ emotions, and perceived family challenges. Participants are recruited through municipal and specialist health centers across Norway. The primary outcome is sibling mental health. Quality of life and family communication are secondary outcomes. Participants are block-randomized to the intervention or 12-week waitlist in groups of six. Measures are collected electronically at pre- and post-intervention/waitlist, as well as 3, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. The main effect to be examined is the difference between the intervention and waitlist at 12 weeks post. All outcomes will also be examined using growth curve analyses. We plan to include 288 siblings and their parents by the end of 2022. Discussion: SIBS-RCT represents a major contribution to the research and practice field towards establishing an evidence-based intervention for siblings. In the event that intervention and waitlist are no different, the impact of SIBS-RCT is still substantial in that we will aim to identify participant subgroups that show positive response and effective components of the SIBS manual by examining group leader adherence as an outcome predictor. This will allow us to continue to re-engineer the SIBS manual iteratively to improve outcomes, and avoid the promotion of a less-than-optimal intervention.

The WHO declared the situation as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and it was finally declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. The Spanish Government obliges the entire population to remain confined to their homes, with the exception of essential basic services, to stop the spread of COVID-19. Home isolation implies a notable physical deconditioning. Telerehabilitation methods have reported positive experiences, and we propose to study in affected patients of COVID-19, due to the general house confinement of the entire Spanish population. Methods: Patients will be recruited in the regions of Andalusia, Murcia, and Valencia (Spain). Patients will remain confined to their homes, and there, they will carry out their assigned exercise program, which will be controlled telematically. Evaluators will attend to carry out all measurements at the beginning, during, and end of the study, telematically controlled. The patients will be randomly divided into three groups, two of them will perform a home exercise program (breathing exercises or non-specific exercises for muscle toning) and the third group will perform sedentary activities, using mental activation techniques, and will act as a sham group. We will evaluate respiratory variables and other variables of the physical state through physical tests, effort, and perceived fatigue. The data will be statistically analyzed, and the hypotheses will be tested between the groups, using the SPSS software, v.24, considering a 95% confidence interval. Discussion: We will analyze the results, in terms of the level of fatigue and perceived exertion, physical health, and maintenance of respiratory activity of two types of exercise programs, toning and respiratory, applied in patients affected by COVID-19 during the period of home confinement. We intend to investigate a field not previously studied, such as the repercussion of carrying out a toning and respiratory exercise program in these patients, in historical circumstances that no one had previously observed in Spain, since the general population has never been forced to remain confined in their homes, due to a pandemic infection, by a coronavirus (COVID-19). Observing the effects that these two home exercise programs could produce in patients infected with COVID-19, we will try to better analyze and understand the mechanisms that are associated with the worsening of breathing in this type of patient.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Data sources: Search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, medRxiv, PROSPERO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Also review of reference lists from recent meta-analyses. Study selection: Randomized clinical trials in which participants were treated with HCQ or placebo/standard-of-care for pre-exposure prophylaxis, post-exposure prophylaxis, or outpatient therapy for COVID-19. Methods: Two investigators independently extracted data on trial design and outcomes. Medication side effects and adverse reactions were also assessed. The primary outcome was COVID-19 hospitalization or death. When unavailable, new COVID-19 infection was used. We calculated random effects meta-analysis according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated by calculation of Cochran Q and I Results: Five randomized controlled clinical trials enrolling 5,577 patients were included. HCQ was associated with a 24% reduction in COVID-19 infection, hospitalization or death, P=.025 (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.59 to 0.97]). No serious adverse cardiac events were reported. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal. Conclusion: Hydroxychloroquine use in outpatients reduces the incidence of the composite outcome of COVID-19 infection, hospitalization, and death.

The adage “old drug, new trick” in this context may suggest the important therapeutic potential of existing drugs. We found that the lopinavir/ritonavir treatment recommended in the fifth edition of the Treatment Plan of China can only help to improve a minority of throat-swab nucleic-acid results (3/15) in hospitals. Our previous use of chloroquine to treat patients with COVID-19 infection showed an improvement in more throat-swab nucleic-acid results (5/10) than the use of lopinavir/ritonavir. Methods/design: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled, multicenter clinical study. The study consists of three phases: a screening period, a treatment period of no more than 10 days, and a follow-up period for each participant. Participants with COVID-19 infection who are eligible for selection for the study will be randomly allocated to the trial group or the control group. The control group will be given lopinavir/ritonavir treatment for no more than 10 days. The trial group will be given chloroquine phosphate treatment for no more than 10 days. The primary outcome is the clinical recovery time at no more than 28 days after the completion of therapy and follow-up. The secondary outcomes include the rate of treatment success after the completion of therapy and follow-up, the time of treatment success after no more than 28 days, the rate of serious adverse events during the completion of therapy and follow-up, and the time to return to normal temperature (calculated from the onset of illness) during the completion of therapy and follow-up. Comparisons will be performed using two-sided tests with a statistical significance level of 5%. Discussion: This experiment should reveal the efficacy and safety of using chloroquine versus lopinavir/ritonavir for patients with mild/general COVID-19 infection. If the new treatment including chloroquine shows a higher rate of throat-swab SARS-CoV-2 real-time fluorescent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) negativity and is safe, it could be tested as a future COVID-19 treatment.

We have identified IFNβ-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFNβ anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFNβ was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. Methods: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFNβ-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFNβ-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 h apart, for a total of 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFNβ-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFNβ-1a in COVID-19 patients. Discussion: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFNβ-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease. In case IFNβ-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. Trial registration: EudraCT 2020-002458-25.

Passive immunotherapy has been successfully used for the treatment of infectious diseases since the 1890s. It is necessary and constructive to compare and analyze COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to help clinicians to have a potential option for COVID-19. Evidence Acquisition: In this study, eight databases were searched on May 1, 2020, such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and Cochrane Library, with the search fields of ""Title Abstract Keyword"" of ""Convalescent plasma AND COVID-19"" or "" Convalescent plasma AND SARS-CoV-2"". The outcome of interest was clinical RCTs for COVID-19. Results: The search retrieved nine relevant CCP protocols for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). All nine trials were randomized, parallel assignment, interventional, clinical treatment studies with NCT04344535, NCT04345289, and NCT04323800 masking and the rest open-label. The estimated enrollment is within the range of 40-1,500 subjects, and five trials will be finished in 2020 as opposed to two in 2021 and two in 2022. Except for NCT04323800 on the prevention of COVID-19, other eight trials will test and verify the effectiveness and safety of CCP for the treatment of COVID-19. The used dosage of CCP is within the range of 200-600 mL. NCT04344535, NCT04323800, and NCT04346446 use standard donor plasma in controlled groups in comparison to NCT04348656, NCT04342182, NCT04333251, and NCT04345523 without any positive drug in controlled groups. NCT04332835 adds hydroxychloroquine to both groups, and only NCT04345289 is a six-armed placebo-controlled trial. Primary and secondary outcome measures are differently expressed in the nine trials. Nevertheless, they can be summarized as ㈠ changes in time, day, and number of a 7-point ordinal scale. There are ㈡ changes in SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (i.e., viral load), anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (i.e., immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G), C-reactive protein, lymphocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, and interleukin 6 on a specified day or during a specific period. Conclusion: The nine well-designed RCT trials will establish the efficacy of CCP for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of evidence-based medicine.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:43","2023-07-03 03:09:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: DoNotEdit Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The randomized study will be a multicenter, multiarm, multistage, randomized controlled trial with a parallel design. An observation only cohort will emerge from those not consenting to randomization. Participants: Eligible will be newly diagnosed patients, either hospitalized or in self-isolation, without any comorbidities or with controlled chronic medical conditions like diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Participants of any gender or age group having tested positive for COVID-19 on Real-Time qRT-PCR (Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR) will be invited to take part in study at twelve centers across eight cities in Pakistan. Those pregnant or lactating, severely dyspneic or with respiratory distress, already undergoing treatment, and with serious comorbidities like liver or kidney failure will be excluded. Intervention and Comparator: There will be a total of seven comparator groups: Each drug (Hydroxychloroquine Phosphate/Sulfate, Oseltamivir and Azithromycin) given as monotherapy (three groups); combinations of each of two drugs (three groups); and a final group on triple drug regimen. Main Outcomes: The laboratory-based primary outcome will be turning the test negative for COVID-19 on qRT-PCR on day 7 of follow-up. The clinical primary outcome will be improvement from baseline of two points on a seven-category ordinal scale of clinical status on day 7 of follow-up. Randomization: Participants will be randomized, maintaining concealment of allocation sequence, using a computer-generated random number list of variable block size into multiple intervention groups in the allocation ratio of 1:1 for all groups. Blinding (masking): This is an open label study, neither physician nor participants will be blinded. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): This is an adaptive design and parameters for formal sample size calculation in a new disease of a previously unknown virus are not available. Thus, the final sample size will be subjected to periodic reviews at each stage of adaptive design and subsequent advice of National Data Safety & Management Board (NDSMB) notified by Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan. Trial Status: Protocol Version 1.7 dated July 5, 2020. By July 03, 2020, the trial had recruited a total of about 470 participants across 12 centers after approval from the National Bioethics Committee and Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan.

Trial design: The study is designed as a multi-center, interventional, parallel-group, randomized (1:1 ratio), investigator-sponsored, two-arm study. Participants: Patients and inpatients will be recruited from 8 Japanese academic and non-academic hospitals. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Intervention and comparator: Patients in the control group will receive conventional treatment with antipyretics, painkillers, or antitussives for symptoms that occurred after they contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Main outcomes: The number of days till at least one of the symptoms (fever, cough, sputum, malaise, shortness of breath) improves in the first 14 days of treatment. To assess the cough, sputum, malaise, and shortness of breath, a numeric rating scale will be used to define improvement in terms of a 2-point decrease in the number of days from the start of treatment for at least 2 days. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37 °C. Randomization: Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group using the minimization method, with balancing of the arms with severity of disease stage and patient age (< 65, 65 to < 75, or ≥ 75 years). Computer-generated random numbers will be used for the minimization method. Blinding (masking): Open-label with no blinding Numbers to be randomized (sample size): The main research hypothesis of this study is that the combination of Kampo medicine and conventional treatment will significantly improve the patients’ symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) during the first 14 days of treatment as compared with conventional treatment alone. Concerning the analysis of the primary endpoint, the duration of time before improvement of at least one of the common cold-like symptoms (fever, malaise, cough, sputum, and shortness of breath) will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the survival curves will be compared between groups using the log-rank test. Assuming this method of analysis and based on previous studies reporting the efficacy of Kampo medicine for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the Kampo medicine group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Assuming a one-sided significance level of 5%, a power of 70%, and an allocation ratio of 1:1, the required sample size is calculated as 126 cases. To compensate for a loss in follow-up, we plan to include 150 cases in both groups (Kampo group = 75, control group = 75).

We aim to investigate whether telemetric continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in quarantined hospitalized patients with diabetes and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or another contagious infection can be successfully implemented and is associated with better glycaemic control than usual blood glucose monitoring (finger prick method) and fewer patient-health care worker contacts. Furthermore, we will assess whether glucose variables are associated with the clinical outcome. Trial Design: This is a single centre, open label, exploratory, randomised, controlled, 2-arm parallel group (1:1 ratio), controlled trial. Participants: The trial population is patients with diabetes (both type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, newly discovered diabetes that is not classified yet, and all other forms of diabetes) admitted to Nordsjællands Hospital that are quarantined due to COVID-19 infection or another infection. Inclusion criteria: Intervention and comparator: Participants will be randomized to either real-time CGM with the Dexcom G6, a CGM system that does not need to be calibrated, or finger-prick glucose monitoring. Blinded CGM will be mounted in the finger-prick group. In the open CGM group, the glucose values will be transmitted to a Smartdevice in the nurse office where glucose levels can be monitored remotely. Main Outcomes: The primary endpoint is the difference between groups in distribution of glucose values being in time in range (TIR), defined as 3.9 to 10 mmol/l. In addition, the primary endpoint is reported as the percentage of days of the whole admission, the patient reaches TIR. Secondary endpoints are the estimated number of saved patient-personnel contacts related to blood glucose measurements, incl. time healthcare providers spent on diabetes related tasks and PPE related tasks, during the patients’ hospitalization. Furthermore, we will assess additional glucose outcomes and associations of glucose variables and patient outcomes (As specified in the protocol). Randomisation: The service used for generating the randomization lists is Blinding (Masking): The design of the trial is open, however blinded CGM is recorded in the finger-prick group. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): A sample size of N=72 is required for the primary endpoint analysis based on 80% power to detect a 10% difference between groups in TIR and to allow for a 15% dropout. The 72 participants will be randomized 1:1 to open CGM or finger-prick with 36 in each group.

It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. Trial design: This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Participants: Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. Intervention and comparator: Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. Main outcomes: The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, Vallières, & Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney Randomisation: This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. Blinding (masking): Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. Trial Status: Recruitment for this study has yet to start. It is anticipated that recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in April 2022.

This inflammation is supposed to be the main driver in the pathogenesis of lung failure (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) in COVID-19. Objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single dose treatment with Tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19. Trial design: Multicentre, prospective, 2-arm randomised (ratio 1:1), double blind, placebo-controlled trial with parallel group design. Participants: Inclusion criteria Intervention and comparator: Intervention arm: Application of 8mg/kg body weight (BW) Tocilizumab i.v. once immediately after randomisation (12 mg/kg for patients with <30kg BW; total dose should not exceed 800 mg) AND conventional treatment. Main outcomes: Primary endpoint is the number of ventilator free days (d) (VFD) in the first 28 days after randomisation. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are defined as ventilator days. VFD’s are counted as zero if the patient dies within the first 28 days. Randomisation: The randomisation code will be generated by the CTU (Clinical Trials Unit, ZKS Freiburg) using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. Randomisation will be stratified by centre and will be performed in blocks of variable length in a ratio of 1:1 within each centre.

This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse events of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19. Methods: Twelve databases were searched through 12 May 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of herbal medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 were eligible. The study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used for the assessment of the risk of bias in all included RCTs. Mean differences (MDs), risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and the effect sizes of the studies were pooled. Results: Seven RCTs with a total of 855 patients were included. All included trials compared the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine to Western medicine alone. The combined therapy significantly improved the total effective rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.34, p < 0.001), cough symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.89, p = 0.005), and sputum production symptom disappearance rate (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.50, p = 0.004). Beneficial effects of the combined therapy were also seen in TCM syndrome score of cough (MD −1.18, 95% CI −1.34 to −1.03, p < 0.001), fever (MD −0.62, 95% CI −0.79 to −0.45, p < 0.001), dry and sore throat (MD −0.83, 95% CI −1.45 to −0.20, p = 0.009), and fatigue (MD −0.60, 95% CI −1.04 to −0.17, p = 0.007). The overall risk of bias of the included studies was unclear. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Significant effects of the combined therapy of herbal medicine with Western medicine were found, and revealed the potential role of herbal medicine in treating COVID-19.

No antiviral treatment options are currently available with proven clinical efficacy. However, preliminary findings from phase III trials suggest that remdesivir is an effective and safe treatment option for COVID-19 patients with both moderate and severe disease. Objective: The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate whether remdesivir was effective for treating COVID-19 including reduced in-hospital adverse events, oxygen support, and mortality rates. Methods: According to PRISMA reporting guidelines, a review was conducted from January 1 2020 until 25 August 2020 with MeSH terms including COVID-19, COVID, coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, remdesivir, adenosine nucleoside triphosphate analog, Veklury using MEDLINE, Scopus, and CINAHL Plus. A modified Delphi process was utilized to include the studies and ensure that the objectives were addressed. Using dichotomous data for select values, the unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated applying Mantel Haenszel (M-H) random-effects method in Review Manager 5.4. Results: Randomized controlled trials pooled in 3013 participants with 46.3% (n=1,395) in the remdesivir group and 53.7% (n=1,618) in the placebo group. The placebo group had a higher risk of mortality as compared to the intervention group with significant odds ratio (OR=0.61) (95% confidence interval of 0.45 0.82; P=0.001). There was minimal heterogeneity among the studies (I Conclusions: Our findings suggest that remdesivir extends clinical benefits by reducing mortality, adverse events and oxygen support in moderate to severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Oxygen delivery by helmet continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a feasible option that enables a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and may theoretically reduce the need for intubation compared to HFNC but direct comparative evidence is lacking. Methods: We plan to perform an investigator-initiated, pragmatic, randomised trial at an intermediate-level COVID-19 cohort ward in Helsingborg Hospital, southern Sweden. We have estimated a required sample size of 120 patients randomised 1:1 to HFNC or Helmet CPAP to achieve 90% power to detect superiority at a 0.05 significance level regarding the primary outcome of ventilator free days (VFD) within 28 days using a Mann-Whitney Discussion: We hypothesise that the use of Helmet CPAP will reduce the need for invasive mechanical ventilation compared to the use of HFNC without having a negative effect on survival.

Since March of this year a rapidly increasing number of publications have reported series of Convalescent plasma (CP) investigations in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Objective: a brief CP scoping review focusing on early mortality Methods: We searched available data bases. Three randomised trials, two pseudo-randomised observations and twelve matched cohort studies were identified. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed on extracted data Results: A total of 2,378 CP treated and 5188 “controls” in 17 studies. Individually only two studies were significant for reduction of deaths to 30 days, but all showed a similar percentage reduction. When pooled, meta-analysis was undertaken. It showed that the overall reduction of death was significant for all series RR 0.710 (p=0.00001), all matched cohort series RR = 0.610 (p-value = 0.001) and the two pseudo-randomised series RR 0.747 (p=0.005) but not the three technically inadequate randomised trials, RR 0.825 (p=0.397). In two of these randomised trials, there was faster clearance of Viral DNA at 72 hours after CP than placebo Conclusion: It is hoped the significance of this less than perfect data will increase interest in completing the delayed randomised trials as the results suggest they could be better than currently licenced drugs. Given increasing published evidence of increased risk of both diagnosis and death from COVID-19 in patients with severe Vitamin-D deficiency, future studies should also study influence of Vitamin-D status of donor and recipient on outcome.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:48","2023-07-03 03:09:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2020.11.19.20234757","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesize that participants who are randomly assigned to receive 2–4 sessions of Solution Focused Brief Therapy would have better clinical outcomes than participants who are in the waitlist group. We additionally hypothesized that using SFBT can also change participants’ depression levels and their coping strategies in dealing with distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trial design: This study employs a randomized delayed crossover open label controlled trial in adolescents who are presenting anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Participants who meet the enrollment criteria stated below will be invited to participate in this study through telecommunication. Those accepting will be randomly allocated to the intervention group or waitlist group. Participants: The inclusion criteria for participants are: Intervention and comparator: The intervention group will receive Solution Focused Brief Therapy 2–4 times within a 2 week period through telecommunication (e.g., using a platform such as Zoom). The comparators will be assigned to the waitlist group. They will also receive 2–4 sessions of counseling service after the 1 month follow-up data is collected. Main outcomes: The primary outcome measures of the study are intended to assess the difference in adolescents’ anxiety levels when comparing the SFBT group and the waitlist group. Level of anxiety will be measured by two measurements: GAD-7 and STAI-Y (C). Follow up 2 weeks and 1 month. Randomization: The Random Number Generator, an internet-based randomization tool, is used to assign participants to the intervention group and waitlist group. The allocation ratio is 1:1. Blinding (masking): Participants will be informed about the group assignment due to the nature of the study design. The research assistant who will have access to the outcome data is blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): The study plans to enroll a total of 76 participants. Thirty-eight participants are to be randomized to each group. Trial status: The Protocol version number is 02, with ethical approval number 202003130012. The recruitment is ongoing. It started on March 20th, and we estimate it will finish by the 30 June 2020. Trial registration: The trial was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on March 20th, 2020.

It helps break the cycle of inflammation through diverse mechanisms including reducing Intereukin-6, Interleukin-8, Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha besides controlling oxidative stress pathways which all are important and pathologic components in the clinical course and outcome of patients infected with COVID-19. This study aims to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine in non-severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Trial design: Prospective, randomized (1:1 ratio), double blind study with parallel group design. Participants: Hospitalized patients with positive nasopharyngeal swab for COVID-19 infection (RT -PCR) and lung Computed tomography scan involvement compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia. The patients are not severely hypoxic, do not need intubation or invasive oxygenation. Intervention and comparator: Eligible enrolled patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A will receive the antiretroviral Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) while group B will receive Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra) + Colchicine 1.5 mg loading then 0.5 mg twice daily orally. All patients in both groups will receive the same amounts of essential minerals, vitamins as antioxidants, and antibiotics. Main outcomes: Primary: Time for clinical improvement and lung CT score changes 14 days after treatment.

Serious and life threatening COVID-19 are defined as per published literature (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). The rationale is that TPE can remove interleukins-3, 6, 8, 10, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Thus, it may reduce the cytokine release syndrome associated with fulminant COVID-19 disease. Trial design: Pilot, interventional, open-label, randomized controlled multicenter trial. Participants: Inclusion criteria are: 1) age ≥ 18 years old; 2) intubation and intensive care unit (ICU) admission; 3) serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19 (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). SARS-CoV-2 infection is confirmed by Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assays using QuantiNova Probe RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Light-Cycler 480 real-time PCR system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Interventions and comparator: The intervention group will receive TPE, plus empiric treatment for COVID-19. TPE is administered using the Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System equipped with commercially available cartridges). The first dose is 1.5 plasma volumes, followed by one plasma volume on alternate days or daily for five to seven total treatments. Spectra Optia TM Apheresis System operates with acid-citrate dextrose anticoagulant (ACDA) as per Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2019 guidelines. Plasma is replaced with albumin 5% or fresh frozen plasma in patients with coagulopathy (prothrombin time >37 seconds; international normalized ratio >3; activated partial thromboplastin time >100 or fibrinogen level <100 mg/d). TPE sessions are performed daily over four hours and laboratory markers measured daily. The comparators are controls not receiving TPE but usual empiric treatment for COVID-19 as per institutional, national and international recommendations. Both groups will receive standard ICU supportive care. Main outcomes: Primary study end-point is 28-day mortality and safety of TPE in serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Safety will be evaluated by the documentation of any pertinent adverse and/or serious adverse effects related to TPE as per institutional, national and international (Food and Drug Administration) guidelines. Secondary outcomes are: i) improvement in Sequential Organ Function Assessment (SOFA) score ; ii) changes in inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, d-dimers and interleukin-6; iii) days on mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay. Randomization: Eligible consented patients are randomized (1:1 allocation) after stratification by ICU center and two PaO2/FIO2 ratio categories (> 150 and ≤ 150). Randomization occurs in variable block sizes of four to eight patients. A web-based randomization service, Blinding (masking): Given the visibility of TPE machinery, the intervention will be unblinded; hence, no enrollment concealment will be expedited. The lack of allocation concealment will be mitigated by several measures (please, refer to the full protocol, Additional file 1). Numbers to be randomized (sample size): This pilot randomized trial aims to recruit a convenience sample of patients with serious and/or life-threatening COVID-19. Therefore, at least 20 patients are to be randomized to each group per participating center. We are hoping to consent and randomize approximately 60 patients in each group over a 3 to 6 months period giving a total of 120 participants. Trial Status: The protocol version 1 was approved 29/04/2020. Recruitment is ongoing, and began on 01/05/2020. We estimate completion by 29/10/2020. Trial registration: Registered at ISRCTN on 18/05/2020 (ISRCTN21363594; doi.10.1186/ ISRCTN21363594).

The condition was that clinical trials must be registered in a public trial registry. World Health Organization-International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO-ICTRP) is the globally centralised network composed of primary registries and partner registries along with data providers. COVID-19 is a pandemic and a significant social and economical health burden. In this event numbers of trials have been undertaken by the medical professionals and research workers in every part of the world. Here we have analysed registered clinical trials for the detection, treatment and prevention of COVID-19 to provide a summary of global response w.s.r.to WHO-ITCRP. The objective of this study was to collect the data of registered clinical trials for the therapeutic and preventive measures for COVID-19 which are registered in WHO-ICTRP and analyse global response of COVID-19. WHO-ITCRP database has 20 fields of mapping. Out of these, we have analysed 6 fields of this registry, for this study purpose: public title, scientific title, study type, countries, intervention and primary outcome. Clinical trials are focused on chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir ritonavir combination, Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Tocilizumab and Interferon. Also, it is seen that convalescent plasma therapy is a promising intervention. Observational trials are directed mainly on the clinical features and distinguish COVID-19 from other influenza like illnesses.</p>","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:51","2023-07-03 03:09:51","","212–212","","3","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Medip Academy Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an effort to find a suitable treatment and prevention options for COVID-19, several COVID-19 clinical trials are being planned and initiated, while a large number of clinical trials for non- COVID-19 indications are suffering delays. With over more than 1000 trials being disrupted and more trials being added to this category daily, there is a direct impact on trial site activation and patient enrolment. This analysis deals with the specific impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the clinical trial and pharmaceutical industry. The objective of this study is to provide an updated information of the disrupted clinical trials and its impact on various therapeutic areas and different drugs. Among the severely affected clinical trials, oncology and CNS trials are the hardest hit therapy areas.This article will certainly emphasize the need for advanced and innovative approaches to maintain the health of the clinical trial ecosystem by continuing the existing trials and the start of the new studies. We have to take and follow necessary actions to guarantee that the initiatives will not be locked during the COVID-19 pandemic, both for the treatment of patients and for the researchers to conduct decision-relevant clinical trials.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:52","2023-07-03 03:09:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","MDPI AG","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.20944/preprints202005.0411.v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has infected more than 1.2 million people and killed more than 64,000. Frantic research is underway to find prevention and cure. Of late, Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) has been speculated as a possible protection from COVID-19. We sought to investigate the evidence behind the claim. Material and Methods:: Data were collected regarding the total number of COVID-19 cases per million and total number of COVID-19 deaths per million in various countries. The BCG vaccination policies of these countries were also obtained. Results:: It was seen that the countries with no universal BCG policy had a mean 1272.9 (median 795) cases per million and 80.7 deaths (median 18) per million population. On the contrary, the countries with a universal BCG vaccination policy had a mean 131.2 (median 40) cases per million and 4 deaths (median 1) per population. The difference is highly significant ( Conclusion:: The data strongly support the hypothesis that BCG may offer protection from COVID-19. Heterologous protection offered by BCG through production of trained immunity, epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes, non-specific activation of NK cells, and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and interleukin 1 beta) production may be the mechanism behind its cross- protection against the novel coronavirus.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:52","2023-07-03 03:09:52","","17–20","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Scientific Scholar Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, effective pharmacological treatments to combat sepsis-induced tissue hypoxia are not available. Emerging experimental and clinical evidence reveals an evolutionary conserved action of thyroid hormone (TH) to adapt injured tissue to hypoxic conditions via its action on p38 MAPK, Akt signaling pathways. In addition, TH has favorable effects on the immune system and viral load in infected tissue. Non-Thyroid Illness Syndrome is common in sepsis, acute myocardial infarction and trauma and is associated with increased mortality. Thus, TH may be a novel treatment in the setting of critical illness due to viral infection in which hypoxia prevails. The present study aims to address the efficacy and safety of acute administration of triiodothyronine (T3) in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients requiring mechanical respiratory support or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). Trial design: This study is a phase II, parallel, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multi-centre, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Participants: Male and female patients aged over 18 years old who are diagnosed with pulmonary infection due to COVID-19, admitted to Intensive Care Unit and requiring mechanical ventilation or ECMO will be enrolled in this trial. Patients will be excluded in cases of pregnancy, severe systemic disease with life expectancy less than 6 months, participation in another trial of an investigational drug or device, corticosteroid and/or sympathomimetic use before initiation of treatment. All data will be collected in electronic CRF files. Participants will start to be recruited from the ICU center of “ATTIKO” University Hospital in Greece. We aim to include two more clinical sites in the trial one from Greece and one from Germany Intervention and comparator: Intervention: T3 Solution for injection 10 μg/ml. The dose administered will be 0.8g/kg i.v. bolus and will be followed by an infusion of 0.113g. kg-1.h-1 i.v. for 48 hours (therapeutic dose). After the first 48h, a maintenance dose will be administered corresponding to 50% of the therapeutic dose (0.057g. kg-1.h-1 i.v.). Drug administration will stop after successful weaning or end of follow up (maximum 30 days). Main outcomes: The primary outcome assessed in the present study will be the percentage of patients successfully weaned after 30 days of follow-up. Successful weaning is defined as no requirement for ventilatory support after extubation (mechanical support) or support from ECMO for 48 hours. Randomisation: An allocation sequence to one of the groups will be prepared by the Sponsor of the study. A 1:1 treatment allocation will be adopted. An electronic CRF will be used incorporating IWRS in order to assure proper randomization and unblinding in emergency cases. The representative of the sponsor will get a copy of randomization codes. The information of the randomization codes will then be locked in the database until the time at which an interim analysis or final analysis is performed. Blinding (masking): Participants, caregivers, and all investigators assessing the outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The sample size of 60 patients (that indicates 30 subjects for each group) will have 84% power to detect the estimated difference between the two study groups. The criterion for significance (alpha) has been set at 0.05 and the test is 2-tailed. Trial Status: Protocol number T3inj-02/ThySupport, version 03, May 11, 2020. The trial is not recruiting yet.

In the absence of an updated systematic review, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized trials that study the effectiveness of HCQ to prevent COVID-19. Methods: A search of PubMed and medRxiv with expert consultation found ten completed randomized trials: seven pre-exposure prophylaxis trials and three post-exposure prophylaxis trials. We obtained or calculated the risk ratio of COVID-19 diagnosis for assignment to HCQ versus no HCQ (either placebo or usual care) for each trial, and then pooled the risk ratio estimates. Results: The pooled risk ratio estimate of the pre-exposure prophylaxis trials was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.91) when using either a fixed effect or a standard random effects approach, and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52-1.00) when using a conservative modification of the Hartung-Knapp random effects approach. The corresponding estimates for the post-exposure prophylaxis trials were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.71-1.16) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.54-1.55). All trials found a similar rate of serious adverse effects in the HCQ and no HCQ groups. Discussion: A benefit of HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19 cannot be ruled out based on the available evidence from randomized trials. However, the “not statistically significant” findings from early prophylaxis trials were widely interpreted as definite evidence of lack of effectiveness of HCQ. This interpretation disrupted the timely completion of the remaining trials and thus the generation of precise estimates for pandemic management before the development of vaccines.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:52","2023-07-03 03:09:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2020.09.29.20203869","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The situation in Sri Lanka changed with the rapid increase of personnel contracting COVID-19 in a naval base camp that housed more than 4000 people. This provided a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), while taking stringent, non-pharmacologic, public health measures to prevent spread. Our aim is to study the effectiveness and safety of HCQ for PEP among naval personnel with exposure to COVID-19-positive patients. Methods/design: This is a placebo-controlled, randomized, clinical trial carried out in the naval base camp and quarantine centers of the Sri Lanka Navy, Ministry of Defense, Sri Lanka. Navy personnel who are exposed to a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection but test negative for the virus on reverse real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at recruitment will be randomized, 200 to each arm, to receive HCQ or placebo and monitored for the development of symptoms or rRT-PCR positivity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus for 14 days. Discussion: This trial will provide high-quality evidence of the effectiveness and safety of HCQ as PEP for COVID-19. The study design is unique due to the circumstances of the outbreak in a confined area among otherwise healthy adults, at a relatively early stage of its spread.

Trial design: This is a multicenter, open-label 2-arm (1:1 ratio) randomized controlled trial. Participants: Patients will be recruited from 3 hospitals in Wenzhou China: the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University and Wenzhou Center Hospital. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as follows: Intervention and comparator: Patients in the control group will receive routine supportive clinically care including the therapies of anti-viral, anti-bacterial and ameliorating the related symptoms, while patients in TCM group will be asked to take maxingshigan-weijing decoction (composed of 14 Chinese herbal medicines), orally 200 mL 2 times daily, for 14 consecutive days in addition to routine supportive care as mentioned above. Main outcomes: The primary outcome will be the number of days until the clinical symptom of fever improves in the first 14 days of treatment following randomisation. Fever will be defined as an improvement when the temperature is less than 37°C. Randomization: Minimization method will be used, balancing the two arms for pneumonia severity. Patients are randomized (1:1 ratio) to each group. Clinical researchers will get a random sequence number which is automatically generated by a random number generator (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and sequentially number them in an opaque envelope. Researchers will open random allocation envelopes and assign participants accordingly. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into a routine supportive care group and a routine supportive care plus oral administration of traditional Chinese medicine group, with 70 patients in each group. Blinding (masking): This is an open-label study. The statistical analysis will be carried out by the Professor of Statistics at Wenzhou Medical University, who is blinded to patient allocation. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): The previous study reported the efficacy of TCM for COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza patients, the median survival time in the TCM group is estimated as 3 days; this time will be 1.5 times longer in the control group. Accordingly, Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test will be used. Trial Status: The trial protocol is Version 2.0, October 14, 2020.

The novel coronavirus first appeared in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to Asia and now many countries around the world are affected by the epidemic. The deaths of many patients, including medical staff, caused social panic, media attention, and high attention from governments and world organizations. Today, with the joint efforts of the government, the doctors and all walks of life, the epidemic in Hubei Province has been brought under control, preventing its spread from affecting the lives of the people. Because of its rapid spread and serious consequences, this sudden novel coronary pneumonia epidemic has become an important social hot spot event. Through the analysis of the novel coronary pneumonia epidemic situation, we can also have a better understanding of sudden infectious diseases in the future, so that we can take more effective response measures, establish a truly predictable and provide reliable and sufficient information for prevention and control model. Methods: We establish different models according to the different developments of the epidemic situation, different time points, and different response measures taken by the government. To be specific, during the period of 2020.1.23-2020.2.7, the traditional SIR model is adopted; during the period of 2020.2.8-2020.3.30, according to the scientific research results, it was considered that the novel coronary pneumonia has a latent period, so in the later phase of epidemic development, the government has effectively isolated patients, thus we adopt the SEIQR model accordingly. During the period of 2020.3.31-2020.5.16, because more asymptomatic infected people were found, we use the SEIQLR model to fit. Finally, through a SEIR simulator, considering the susceptible number, the latent number, the infected number, the cured number, death number and other factors, we simulate the change of various numbers of people from the beginning to the next 180 days of novel coronary pneumonia. Findings: The results based on the analysis of differential equations and kinetic models show that through the prediction of the model established in the first phase, the epidemic situation of novel coronary pneumonia in Hubei Province was controlled at the end of March, which is in line with the actual situation. The rest of Hubei province, except for Wuhan, lifted control of the departure channel from 0:00 am on March 25, and Wuhan was also unblocked on April 8. Through the establishment of the second-phase model, it is found that the epidemic situation will reach its peak in mid-February. For example, the quarantine admission of the hospital declined after mid-February, which is inseparable from the measures to build square cabin hospitals in early February so that more and more patients can be admitted. The model established in the third phase shows that the epidemic had been completely controlled by the end of May, which is also in line with the reality. Because in mid-May, the Wuhan government conducted a nucleic acid test on all the citizens to screen for asymptomatic infected persons to fundamentally control the spread of novel coronary pneumonia. Interpretation: Hubei Province, as the center of the initial outbreak of novel coronary pneumonia, people were forced to be isolated at home during the Spring Festival, the most important Chinese holiday, and the whole society was in a state of suspension of work and study. The Chinese government had taken many measures in response to the epidemic, such as shutting down the city, vigorously building square cabin hospitals, and prohibiting people from gathering. At the beginning of May this year, the epidemic in Hubei Province was finally effectively controlled. For ordinary citizens, we should not cause unnecessary panic about the unknown novel coronavirus. Instead, we should fully understand and be familiar with this virus. In addition to the relevant medical knowledge, we should also understand the spread of infectious diseases through appropriate mathematical models. By mathematical models, we can understand the degree of harm of infectious diseases, when to control it, how to stop it, and use scientific views to reveal the original face of the novel coronavirus to the public without causing social panic.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:54","2023-07-03 03:09:54","","1–11","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Auctores Publishing LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, population use of BCG vaccine has been associated with improved outcomes. This study sought to determine the association of population use of BCG, adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccination with Covid-19 mortality when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. Methods: Using publicly available data, mortality adjusted for the timeframe of crisis, population size and population characteristics was calculated. The primary analysis was the relationship between each of the day 15 and day 30 standardised mortality rates and BCG, adult pneumococcal and influenza vaccination scores using unadjusted measures and with adjustment for population structure and case fatality rates. Secondary analyses were measures of case increases and mortality increases from day 15 to day 30 for each of the relative vaccination scores. Finally, we also analysed the peak Z score reflecting increases in total mortality from historical averages reported by EuroMOMO (Euromomo.eu), Results: Following adjustment for the effects of population size, median age, population density, the proportion of population living in an urban setting, life-expectancy, the elderly dependency ratio (or proportion over 65 years), net migration, days from day 1 to lockdown and case-fatality rate, only BCG vaccination score remained significantly associated with Covid-19 mortality at day 30. In the best fit model, BCG vaccination score was associated with a 64% reduction in log(10) mortality per 10 million population (OR 0.362 reduction [95% CI 0.188 to 0.698]), following adjustment for population size, median age, density, urbanization, elderly dependency ratio, days to lockdown, yearly migration and case fatality rate. Conclusion: BCG vaccine was associated with reduced mortality rates in level 4 countries while adult pneumococcal and adult seasonal influenza vaccines were not when adjusted for a number of confounding variables. A number of trials are ongoing to determine if BCG is protective against severe Covid-19 infection.","2020","2023-07-03 03:09:54","2023-07-03 03:09:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.1101/2020.06.03.20121624","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-like changes and overactivation of Th17 cells (these produce cytokines) in patients with COVID-19. We aim to explore the safety and efficacy of ixekizumab (an injectable drug for the treatment of autoimmune diseases) to prevent organ injury caused by the immune response to COVID-19. Ixekizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-17A and inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Trial design: The experiment is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the open trial, 3 patients with COVID-19 are treated with ixekizumab, and the safety and efficacy are observed for 7 days. In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. This is a two-center, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial with 2-arm parallel group design (1:1 ratio). Participants: Patients with COVID-19 aged 18-75 with increased Interleukin (IL)-6 levels will be enrolled, but patients with severe infections requiring intensive care will be excluded. The trial will be undertaken in two centers. The first stage is carried out in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, and the second stage is carried out simultaneously in the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Intervention and comparator: In the first stage, three subjects are given ixekizumab (“Taltz”) (80 mg/ml, 160 mg as a single hypodermic injection) and antiviral therapy (α-interferon (administer 5 million U by aerosol inhalation twice daily), lopinavir/ritonavir (administer 100mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), chloroquine (administer 500mg by mouth twice daily, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), ribavirin (administer 500mg by intravenous injection two to three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), or arbidol (administer 200mg by mouth three times a day, for the course of therapy no more than 10 days), but not more than 3 types). The treatment course of the first stage is 7 days. Main outcomes: The primary outcome is a change in pulmonary CT severity score (an imaging tool for assessing COVID-19, which scores on the basis of all abnormal areas involved). Pulmonary CT severity score is assessed on the 7th day, 14th day, or at discharge. Randomisation: In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. The eLite random system of Nanjing Medical University is used for randomization. Blinding (masking): The main efficacy indicator, the CT results, will be evaluated by the third-party blinded and independent research team. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): In the second stage, 40 patients with COVID-19 are randomly divided into two groups at 1:1 for 14 days. Trial Status: Trial registration number is ChiCTR2000030703 (version 1.7 as of March 19, 2020). The recruitment is ongoing, and the date recruitment was initiated in June 2020.

Mycobacterium bovis ( M. bovis ) infection is the cause of bovine TB, which occasionally infects other species of mammals including humans and wildlife, a main reason of the difficulty to eradicate TB around the world. Recent studies in immunometabolism demonstrated that host cholesterol levels have implications in the establishment of Mtb infection, which lead to the development of host-directed therapy (HDT) strategies for treatment of TB. Methods: In the present report, the involvements of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC-transporters)- and cholesterol acyltransferase1 (ACAT1)-mediated intracellular cholesterol in autophagy of bovine macrophages induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) were interrogated by enzymatic and biochemistry assays i n vitro, including quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting. Results: The results showed that a down-regulated expression of the ABC-transporters and ACAT1 in primary bovine alveolar macrophages (AMs) and murine RAW264.7 cells in response to the BCG infection. The inhibited expression of ABC-transporters and ACAT1 was associated with the reduction of intracellular free cholesterol, which in turn induced autophagy in macrophages upon to the Mycobacterial infection. These results strongly suggest an involvement of ABC-transporters and ACAT1 in intracellular cholesterol-mediated autophagy in macrophages in response to Mycobacterial infections. Conclusion: This study thus provides an insight into mechanism of immunometabolism of macrophages in response to the Mtb infection, and informative data for development of HDT in TB treatments.","2019","2023-07-03 03:09:56","2023-07-03 03:09:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","Research Square Platform LLC","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.21203/rs.2.14164/v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BCG immunization has been shown to enhance innate immunity. This effect of BCG can be explained by an enhancing effect on innate immunity.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> <p>This study aimed to test the following hypotheses: (1) BCG immunization can prevent infection with MTB, (2) prevention of infection occurs via stimulation of NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain) and toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2), and (3) the effect of BCG immunization on prevention of infection with MTB can be enhanced by giving stimulators of NOD2 and TLR2.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> <p>To detect the influence of immunization on infection rates, the ultralow dose (ULD) infection model is used. The infection rate of mice vaccinated with BCG and exposed after 6 weeks to ULD of MTB and unvaccinated mice are compared via cultures of lung homogenates and interferon (IFN) gamma release assay. If a reduced infection rate by BCG immunization is confirmed, the experiment is repeated by giving BCG combined simultaneously or in time sequence with the enhancers of innate immunity murabutide or beta-glycan. The influence of murabutide or beta-glycan alone on infection rates is investigated. To quantify the contribution of innate immunity levels of tumor necrosis factor, IFN gamma expression, histone H3 K4me3 trimethylation, and concentrations of monocytes with features of activation of innate immunity as defined by the Ly6Chigh as well as CD11b positive phenotype in immunized versus unimmunized infected and uninfected mice in the various immunization protocols is compared. The experiments will be repeated with prior application of the inhibitors of epigenetic programming of innate immunity histone methyltransferase inhibitor 5’-deoxy-5’-methylthio-adenosine and histone acetyl transferase inhibitor epigallocatechin-3-gallate. The influence of BCG on innate immunity is further corroborated by a prospective observational study in human infants.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> <p>Investigations of derivatives of muramyl dipeptide (MDP) to enhance early immunity in the C57BL/6 mouse strain (mice aged 7 weeks) by another group used 300 micrograms per mouse of oil-associated 6-0-mycoloyl-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (mycol-MDP) 50/50 mixed with Freund’s incomplete adjuvant. Comparison of colony-forming unit (CFU) count in the lungs 3 weeks after aerosol challenge with Mycobacterium bovis of groups (n=5) between groups receiving mycol-MDP in oil emulsion (see above) versus controls (n=5) showed a significantly lower CFU count of 94.5 x106 (SD 22.0) in cases versus controls with 204.0 X 106 (SD 77.6). It is important to note that after elimination of T-cells in this model, a reduction of CFU in lungs of mice treated with mycol-MDP persisted albeit without statistical significance, which was possibly related to the small number of animals used.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> <p>Demonstration of a reduction of MTB infection by enhancement of innate immunity could show a new approach to improving vaccine efficacy against this pathogen.</p> </sec> <sec> <title>INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPOR</title> <p>PRR1-10.2196/13045</p> </sec>","2018","2023-07-03 03:09:57","2023-07-03 03:09:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","JMIR Publications Inc.","","","","","","","","","Type: posted-content DOI: 10.2196/preprints.13045","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The differences between the two methodologies make their combination an interesting ‘extreme case’ of mixed methods research. The book is about how to use qualitative research when preparing for, undertaking, or implementing the results of an RCT. The focus is on a range of designs, including pilot and pragmatic RCTs. The book focuses on health research because the majority of RCTs are undertaken in this field. It is written for researchers who are undertaking or planning to undertake qualitative research with RCTs. The book may also be useful to researchers leading RCTs and graduate students. It does not explain how to do qualitative research or how to do RCTs. The book focuses on how to undertake qualitative research in the specific context of RCTs. The book is divided into three parts. Part 2 offers the practical guidance promised within the title of the book. Each chapter focuses on key steps when undertaking qualitative research in the context of RCTs: writing a proposal, selecting research questions, collecting data, analysing data, integrating qualitative and quantitative components, and publishing.

However, although the vaccine has been established, discussions about its benefits and shortcomings continue.The coverage of immunization is appropriate with the target, but still the occurrence of child TB cases raises a problem of its own. This studywas a non-experimental study with study design was Case Control Study by retrospective. The effectiveness of BCG immunization in this study is 85%, meaning that children are given BCG 85% immunization will be protected from Tuberculocis (TB) disease. If the child does not get BCG immunization will increase the chances for the child, with OR = 6.87 (95% CI; 2.2 – 21.1) with p value = 0.000.

Groups include an experimental intervention group that is being compared to a treatment as usual, a low dose or attention control condition, and/or a comparative treatment group. The purpose of randomization is to equalize groups on both known and unknown characteristics that may influence the outcome and the effectiveness of the intervention. This chapter describes how music therapists have used RCTs to demonstrate the effectiveness of music therapy interventions and services. Key strategies for implementing RCT designs are presented, and studies in music therapy that have used this design are reviewed.</p>","2015","2023-07-03 03:10:02","2023-07-03 03:10:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press Type: book","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, we may be seriously misled if we are relying on robust study design to ensure accurate, safe, and effective diagnostic tests. Properly conducted, randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for assessing the effectiveness and safety of interventions, yet are rarely conducted in the assessment of diagnostic tests. Instead, diagnostic cohort studies are commonly performed to assess the characteristics of a diagnostic test including sensitivity and specificity. While diagnostic cohort studies can inform us about the relative accuracy of an experimental diagnostic intervention compared to a reference standard, they do not inform us about whether the differences in accuracy are clinically important, or the degree of clinical importance (in other words, the impact on patient outcomes). In this commentary we provide the advantages of the diagnostic randomized controlled trial and suggest a greater awareness and uptake in their conduct. Doing so will better ensure that patients are offered diagnostic procedures that will make a clinical difference.","2012","2023-07-03 03:10:10","2023-07-03 03:10:10","","","","1","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer Science and Business Media LLC Type: journal-article","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question ‘why?’ underlies all aetiological research from laboratory science to epidemiology. The cross-sectional, case–control and cohort methodologies discussed in other chapters in this book provide the methodology for addressing ‘why?’ questions. However, just as medicine is more than diagnosis it also covers treatment, medical research is more than aetiology: it also necessarily extends to the evaluation of interventions.</p> <p>Aetiological research which cannot be translated into health benefits through new or improved interventions is at best sterile and at worse selfindulgent, begging another important question: ‘so what?’. Flawed evaluations of interventions can be even more problematic since these may harm rather than help. Intervention studies (of which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the most important type, on the basis of quality of evidence available from them) take aetiological insights into action and provide the best evidence upon which to found clinical practice.</p> <p>In this chapter we will consider some of the more important factors in the design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation of RCTs.</p>","2003","2023-07-03 03:10:19","2023-07-03 03:10:19","","177–202","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Oxford University Press Type: book-chapter","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
